CHAPTER I

     By Cauk and keel to win your bread,
     Wi’ whigmaleeries for them wha need,
     Whilk is a gentle trade indeed
     To carry the gaberlunzie on.

     Old Song.

FEW have been in my secret while I was compiling these narratives, nor
is it probable that they will ever become public during the life of
their author. Even were that event to happen, I am not ambitious of the
honoured distinction, digito monstrari. I confess that, were it safe to
cherish such dreams at all, I should more enjoy the thought of remaining
behind the curtain unseen, like the ingenious manager of Punch and his
wife Joan, and enjoying the astonishment and conjectures of my audience.
Then might I, perchance, hear the productions of the obscure Peter
Pattieson praised by the judicious and admired by the feeling,
engrossing the young and attracting even the old; while the critic
traced their fame up to some name of literary celebrity, and the
question when, and by whom, these tales were written filled up the pause
of conversation in a hundred circles and coteries. This I may never
enjoy during my lifetime; but farther than this, I am certain, my vanity
should never induce me to aspire.

I am too stubborn in habits, and too little polished in manners, to envy
or aspire to the honours assigned to my literary contemporaries. I could
not think a whit more highly of myself were I found worthy to “come in
place as a lion” for a winter in the great metropolis. I could not rise,
turn round, and show all my honours, from the shaggy mane to the tufted
tail, “roar you an’t were any nightingale,” and so lie down again like a
well-behaved beast of show, and all at the cheap and easy rate of a
cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter as thin as a wafer. And
I could ill stomach the fulsome flattery with which the lady of the
evening indulges her show-monsters on such occasions, as she crams her
parrots with sugar-plums, in order to make them talk before company. I
cannot be tempted to “come aloft” for these marks of distinction, and,
like imprisoned Samson, I would rather remain--if such must be the
alternative--all my life in the mill-house, grinding for my very bread,
than be brought forth to make sport for the Philistine lords and ladies.
This proceeds from no dislike, real or affected, to the aristocracy of
these realms. But they have their place, and I have mine; and, like
the iron and earthen vessels in the old fable, we can scarce come
into collision without my being the sufferer in every sense. It may be
otherwise with the sheets which I am now writing. These may be opened
and laid aside at pleasure; by amusing themselves with the perusal, the
great will excite no false hopes; by neglecting or condemning them, they
will inflict no pain; and how seldom can they converse with those whose
minds have toiled for their delight without doing either the one or the
other.

In the better and wiser tone of feeling with Ovid only expresses in one
line to retract in that which follows, I can address these quires--

Parve, nec invideo, sine me, liber, ibis in urbem.

Nor do I join the regret of the illustrious exile, that he himself could
not in person accompany the volume, which he sent forth to the mart
of literature, pleasure, and luxury. Were there not a hundred similar
instances on record, the rate of my poor friend and school-fellow, Dick
Tinto, would be sufficient to warn me against seeking happiness in the
celebrity which attaches itself to a successful cultivator of the fine
arts.

Dick Tinto, when he wrote himself artist, was wont to derive his origin
from the ancient family of Tinto, of that ilk, in Lanarkshire, and
occasionally hinted that he had somewhat derogated from his gentle blood
in using the pencil for his principal means of support. But if Dick’s
pedigree was correct, some of his ancestors must have suffered a more
heavy declension, since the good man his father executed the necessary,
and, I trust, the honest, but certainly not very distinguished,
employment of tailor in ordinary to the village of Langdirdum in the
west.. Under his humble roof was Richard born, and to his father’s
humble trade was Richard, greatly contrary to his inclination, early
indentured. Old Mr. Tinto had, however, no reason to congratulate
himself upon having compelled the youthful genius of his son to forsake
its natural bent. He fared like the school-boy who attempts to stop with
his finger the spout of a water cistern, while the stream, exasperated
at this compression, escapes by a thousand uncalculated spurts, and wets
him all over for his pains. Even so fared the senior Tinto, when his
hopeful apprentice not only exhausted all the chalk in making sketches
upon the shopboard, but even executed several caricatures of his
father’s best customers, who began loudly to murmur, that it was too
hard to have their persons deformed by the vestments of the father, and
to be at the same time turned into ridicule by the pencil of the son.
This led to discredit and loss of practice, until the old tailor,
yielding to destiny and to the entreaties of his son, permitted him to
attempt his fortune in a line for which he was better qualified.

There was about this time, in the village of Langdirdum, a peripatetic
brother of the brush, who exercised his vocation sub Jove frigido, the
object of admiration of all the boys of the village, but especially
to Dick Tinto. The age had not yet adopted, amongst other unworthy
retrenchments, that illiberal measure of economy which, supplying by
written characters the lack of symbolical representation, closes one
open and easily accessible avenue of instruction and emolument against
the students of the fine arts. It was not yet permitted to write upon
the plastered doorway of an alehouse, or the suspended sign of an
inn, “The Old Magpie,” or “The Saracen’s Head,” substituting that cold
description for the lively effigies of the plumed chatterer, or the
turban’d frown of the terrific soldan. That early and more simple age
considered alike the necessities of all ranks, and depicted the symbols
of good cheer so as to be obvious to all capacities; well judging that a
man who could not read a syllable might nevertheless love a pot of good
ale as well as his better-educated neighbours, or even as the parson
himself. Acting upon this liberal principle, publicans as yet hung forth
the painted emblems of their calling, and sign-painters, if they seldom
feasted, did not at least absolutely starve.

To a worthy of this decayed profession, as we have already intimated,
Dick Tinto became an assistant; and thus, as is not unusual among
heaven-born geniuses in this department of the fine arts, began to paint
before he had any notion of drawing.

His talent for observing nature soon induced him to rectify the errors,
and soar above the instructions, of his teacher. He particularly
shone in painting horses, that being a favourite sign in the Scottish
villages; and, in tracing his progress, it is beautiful to observe how
by degrees he learned to shorten the backs and prolong the legs of these
noble animals, until they came to look less like crocodiles, and
more like nags. Detraction, which always pursues merit with strides
proportioned to its advancement, has indeed alleged that Dick once upon
a time painted a horse with five legs, instead of four. I might have
rested his defence upon the license allowed to that branch of his
profession, which, as it permits all sorts of singular and irregular
combinations, may be allowed to extend itself so far as to bestow a limb
supernumerary on a favourite subject. But the cause of a deceased friend
is sacred; and I disdain to bottom it so superficially. I have visited
the sign in question, which yet swings exalted in the village of
Langdirdum; and I am ready to depone upon the oath that what has been
idly mistaken or misrepresented as being the fifth leg of the horse, is,
in fact, the tail of that quadruped, and, considered with reference to
the posture in which he is delineated, forms a circumstance introduced
and managed with great and successful, though daring, art. The nag
being represented in a rampant or rearing posture, the tail, which is
prolonged till it touches the ground, appears to form a point d’appui,
and gives the firmness of a tripod to the figure, without which it would
be difficult to conceive, placed as the feet are, how the courser could
maintain his ground without tumbling backwards. This bold conception has
fortunately fallen into the custody of one by whom it is duly valued;
for, when Dick, in his more advanced state of proficiency, became
dubious of the propriety of so daring a deviation to execute a picture
of the publican himself in exchange for this juvenile production,
the courteous offer was declined by his judicious employer, who
had observed, it seems, that when his ale failed to do its duty in
conciliating his guests, one glance at his sign was sure to put them in
good humour.

It would be foreign to my present purpose to trace the steps by which
Dick Tinto improved his touch, and corrected, by the rules of art, the
luxuriance of a fervid imagination. The scales fell from his eyes on
viewing the sketches of a contemporary, the Scottish Teniers, as
Wilkie has been deservedly styled. He threw down the brush took up
the crayons, and, amid hunger and toil, and suspense and uncertainty,
pursued the path of his profession under better auspices than those of
his original master. Still the first rude emanations of his genius, like
the nursery rhymes of Pope, could these be recovered, will be dear to
the companions of Dick Tinto’s youth. There is a tankard and gridiron
painted over the door of an obscure change-house in the Back Wynd of
Gandercleugh----But I feel I must tear myself from the subject, or dwell
on it too long.

Amid his wants and struggles, Dick Tinto had recourse, like his
brethren, to levying that tax upon the vanity of mankind which he could
not extract from their taste and liberality--on a word, he painted
portraits. It was in this more advanced state of proficiency, when Dick
had soared above his original line of business, and highly disdained any
allusion to it, that, after having been estranged for several years,
we again met in the village of Gandercleugh, I holding my present
situation, and Dick painting copies of the human face divine at a guinea
per head. This was a small premium, yet, in the first burst of business,
it more than sufficed for all Dick’s moderate wants; so that he occupied
an apartment at the Wallace Inn, cracked his jest with impunity even
upon mine host himself, and lived in respect and observance with the
chambermaid, hostler, and waiter.

Those halcyon days were too serene to last long. When his honour the
Laird of Gandercleugh, with his wife and three daughters, the minister,
the gauger, mine esteemed patron Mr. Jedediah Cleishbotham, and some
round dozen of the feuars and farmers, had been consigned to immortality
by Tinto’s brush, custom began to slacken, and it was impossible to
wring more than crowns and half-crowns from the hard hands of the
peasants whose ambition led them to Dick’s painting-room.

Still, though the horizon was overclouded, no storm for some time
ensued. Mine host had Christian faith with a lodger who had been a
good paymaster as long as he had the means. And from a portrait of our
landlord himself, grouped with his wife and daughters, in the style of
Rubens, which suddenly appeared in the best parlour, it was evident that
Dick had found some mode of bartering art for the necessaries of life.

Nothing, however, is more precarious than resources of this nature. It
was observed that Dick became in his turn the whetstone of mine host’s
wit, without venturing either at defence or retaliation; that his easel
was transferred to a garret-room, in which there was scarce space for
it to stand upright; and that he no longer ventured to join the weekly
club, of which he had been once the life and soul. In short, Dick
Tinto’s friends feared that he had acted like the animal called the
sloth, which, heaving eaten up the last green leaf upon the tree where
it has established itself, ends by tumbling down from the top, and
dying of inanition. I ventured to hint this to Dick, recommended his
transferring the exercise of his inestimable talent to some other
sphere, and forsaking the common which he might be said to have eaten
bare.

“There is an obstacle to my change of residence,” said my friend,
grasping my hand with a look of solemnity.

“A bill due to my landlord, I am afraid?” replied I, with heartfelt
sympathy; “if any part of my slender means can assist in this
emergence----”

“No, by the soul of Sir Joshua!” answered the generous youth, “I will
never involve a friend in the consequences of my own misfortune. There
is a mode by which I can regain my liberty; and to creep even through a
common sewer is better than to remain in prison.”

I did not perfectly understand what my friend meant. The muse of
painting appeared to have failed him, and what other goddess he could
invoke in his distress was a mystery to me. We parted, however, without
further explanation, and I did not see him until three days after, when
he summoned me to partake of the “foy” with which his landlord proposed
to regale him ere his departure for Edinburgh.

I found Dick in high spirits, whistling while he buckled the small
knapsack which contained his colours, brushes, pallets, and clean shirt.
That he parted on the best terms with mine host was obvious from the
cold beef set forth in the low parlour, flanked by two mugs of admirable
brown stout; and I own my curiosity was excited concerning the means
through which the face of my friend’s affairs had been so suddenly
improved. I did not suspect Dick of dealing with the devil, and by what
earthly means he had extricated himself thus happily I was at a total
loss to conjecture.

He perceived my curiosity, and took me by the hand. “My friend,” he
said, “fain would I conceal, even from you, the degradation to which
it has been necessary to submit, in order to accomplish an honourable
retreat from Gandercleaugh. But what avails attempting to conceal that
which must needs betray itself even by its superior excellence? All
the village--all the parish--all the world--will soon discover to what
poverty has reduced Richard Tinto.”

A sudden thought here struck me. I had observed that our landlord wore,
on that memorable morning, a pair of bran new velveteens instead of his
ancient thicksets.

“What,” said I, drawing my right hand, with the forefinger and thumb
pressed together, nimbly from my right haunch to my left shoulder, “you
have condescended to resume the paternal arts to which you were first
bred--long stitches, ha, Dick?”

He repelled this unlucky conjecture with a frown and a pshaw, indicative
of indignant contempt, and leading me into another room, showed me,
resting against the wall, the majestic head of Sir William Wallace, grim
as when severed from the trunk by the orders of the Edward.

The painting was executed on boards of a substantial thickness, and
the top decorated with irons, for suspending the honoured effigy upon a
signpost.

“There,” he said, “my friend, stands the honour of Scotland, and my
shame; yet not so--rather the shame of those who, instead of encouraging
art in its proper sphere, reduce it to these unbecoming and unworthy
extremities.”

I endeavoured to smooth the ruffled feelings of my misused and indignant
friend. I reminded him that he ought not, like the stag in the fable, to
despise the quality which had extricated him from difficulties, in
which his talents, as a portrait or landscape painter, had been found
unavailing. Above all, I praised the execution, as well as conception,
of his painting, and reminded him that, far from feeling dishonoured by
so superb a specimen of his talents being exposed to the general view
of the public, he ought rather to congratulate himself upon the
augmentation of his celebrity to which its public exhibition must
necessarily give rise.

“You are right, my friend--you are right,” replied poor Dick, his eye
kindling with enthusiasm; “why should I shun the name of an--an--(he
hesitated for a phrase)--an out-of-doors artist? Hogarth has introduced
himself in that character in one of his best engravings; Domenichino,
or somebody else, in ancient times, Morland in our own, have exercised
their talents in this manner. And wherefore limit to the rich and
higher classes alone the delight which the exhibition of works of art is
calculated to inspire into all classes? Statues are placed in the
open air, why should Painting be more niggardly in displaying her
masterpieces than her sister Sculpture? And yet, my friend, we must part
suddenly; the carpenter is coming in an hour to put up the--the emblem;
and truly, with all my philosophy, and your consolatory encouragement
to boot, I would rather wish to leave Gandercleugh before that operation
commences.”

We partook of our genial host’s parting banquet, and I escorted Dick on
his walk to Edinburgh. We parted about a mile from the village, just as
we heard the distant cheer of the boys which accompanied the mounting
of the new symbol of the Wallace Head. Dick Tinto mended his pace to get
out of hearing, so little had either early practice or recent philosophy
reconciled him to the character of a sign-painter.

In Edinburgh, Dick’s talents were discovered and appreciated, and he
received dinners and hints from several distinguished judges of the fine
arts. But these gentlemen dispensed their criticism more willingly than
their cash, and Dick thought he needed cash more than criticism. He
therefore sought London, the universal mart of talent, and where, as is
usual in general marts of most descriptions, much more of each commodity
is exposed to sale than can ever find purchasers.

Dick, who, in serious earnest, was supposed to have considerable natural
talents for his profession, and whose vain and sanguine disposition
never permitted him to doubt for a moment of ultimate success, threw
himself headlong into the crowd which jostled and struggled for notice
and preferment. He elbowed others, and was elbowed himself; and finally,
by dint of intrepidity, fought his way into some notice, painted for
the prize at the Institution, had pictures at the exhibition at Somerset
House, and damned the hanging committee. But poor Dick was doomed to
lose the field he fought so gallantly. In the fine arts, there is scarce
an alternative betwixt distinguished success and absolute failure; and
as Dick’s zeal and industry were unable to ensure the first, he
fell into the distresses which, in his condition, were the natural
consequences of the latter alternative. He was for a time patronised
by one or two of those judicious persons who make a virtue of being
singular, and of pitching their own opinions against those of the world
in matters of taste and criticism. But they soon tired of poor Tinto,
and laid him down as a load, upon the principle on which a spoilt child
throws away its plaything. Misery, I fear, took him up, and accompanied
him to a premature grave, to which he was carried from an obscure
lodging in Swallow Street, where he had been dunned by his landlady
within doors, and watched by bailiffs without, until death came to
his relief. A corner of the Morning Post noticed his death, generously
adding, that his manner displayed considerable genius, though his style
was rather sketchy; and referred to an advertisement, which announced
that Mr. Varnish, a well-known printseller, had still on hand a very
few drawings and painings by Richard Tinto, Esquire, which those of
the nobility and gentry who might wish to complete their collections of
modern art were invited to visit without delay. So ended Dick Tinto! a
lamentable proof of the great truth, that in the fine arts mediocrity
is not permitted, and that he who cannot ascend to the very top of the
ladder will do well not to put his foot upon it at all.

The memory of Tinto is dear to me, from the recollection of the many
conversations which we have had together, most of them turning upon
my present task. He was delighted with my progress, and talked of an
ornamented and illustrated edition, with heads, vignettes, and culs de
lampe, all to be designed by his own patriotic and friendly pencil.
He prevailed upon an old sergeant of invalids to sit to him in the
character of Bothwell, the lifeguard’s-man of Charles the Second, and
the bellman of Gandercleugh in that of David Deans. But while he thus
proposed to unite his own powers with mine for the illustration of
these narratives, he mixed many a dose of salutary criticism with the
panegyrics which my composition was at times so fortunate as to call
forth.

“Your characters,” he said, “my dear Pattieson, make too much use of
the gob box; they patter too much (an elegant phraseology which Dick had
learned while painting the scenes of an itinerant company of players);
there is nothing in whole pages but mere chat and dialogue.”

“The ancient philosopher,” said I in reply, “was wont to say, ‘Speak,
that I may know thee’; and how is it possible for an author to introduce
his personae dramatis to his readers in a more interesting and effectual
manner than by the dialogue in which each is represented as supporting
his own appropriate character?”

“It is a false conclusion,” said Tinto; “I hate it, Peter, as I hate
an unfilled can. I grant you, indeed, that speech is a faculty of some
value in the intercourse of human affairs, and I will not even insist on
the doctrine of that Pythagorean toper, who was of opinion that over
a bottle speaking spoiled conversation. But I will not allow that a
professor of the fine arts has occasion to embody the idea of his scene
in language, in order to impress upon the reader its reality and its
effect. On the contrary, I will be judged by most of your readers,
Peter, should these tales ever become public, whether you have not
given us a page of talk for every single idea which two words might have
communicated, while the posture, and manner, and incident, accurately
drawn, and brougth out by appropriate colouring, would have preserved
all that was worthy of preservation, and saved these everlasting ‘said
he’s’ and ‘said she’s,’ with which it has been your pleasure to encumber
your pages.”

I replied, “That he confounded the operations of the pencil and the pen;
that the serene and silent art, as painting has been called by one of
our first living poets, necessarily appealed to the eye, because it had
not the organs for addressing the ear; whereas poetry, or that species
of composition which approached to it, lay under the necessity of doing
absolutely the reverse, and addressed itself to the ear, for the purpose
of exciting that interest which it could not attain through the medium
of the eye.”

Dick was not a whit staggered by my argument, which he contended was
founded on misrepresentation. “Description,” he said, “was to the author
of a romance exactly what drawing and tinting were to a painter: words
were his colours, and, if properly employed, they could not fail to
place the scene which he wished to conjure up as effectually before the
mind’s eye as the tablet or canvas presents it to the bodily organ.
The same rules,” he contended, “applied to both, and an exuberance
of dialogue, in the former case, was a verbose and laborious mode
of composition which went to confound the proper art of fictitious
narrative with that of the drama, a widely different species of
composition, of which dialogue was the very essence, because all,
excepting the language to be made use of, was presented to the eye by
the dresses, and persons, and actions of the performers upon the stage.
But as nothing,” said Dick, “can be more dull than a long narrative
written upon the plan of a drama, so where you have approached most near
to that species of composition, by indulging in prolonged scenes of mere
conversation, the course of your story has become chill and constrained,
and you have lost the power of arresting the attention and exciting
the imagination, in which upon other occasions you may be considered as
having succeeded tolerably well.”

I made my bow in requital of the compliment, which was probably thrown
in by way of placebo, and expressed myself willing at least to make one
trial of a more straightforward style of composition, in which my actors
should do more, and say less, than in my former attempts of this kind.
Dick gave me a patronising and approving nod, and observed that, finding
me so docile, he would communicate, for the benefit of my muse, a
subject which he had studied with a view to his own art.

“The story,” he said, “was, by tradition, affirmed to be truth,
although, as upwards of a hundred years had passed away since the events
took place, some doubts upon the accuracy of all the particulars might
be reasonably entertained.”

When Dick Tinto had thus spoken, he rummaged his portfolio for the
sketch from which he proposed one day to execute a picture of fourteen
feet by eight. The sketch, which was cleverly executed, to use the
appropriate phrase, represented an ancient hall, fitted up and furnished
in what we now call the taste of Queen Elizabeth’s age. The light,
admitted from the upper part of a high casement, fell upon a female
figure of exquisite beauty, who, in an attitude of speechless terror,
appeared to watch the issue of a debate betwixt two other persons. The
one was a young man, in the Vandyke dress common to the time of Charles
I., who, with an air of indignant pride, testified by the manner in
which he raised his head and extended his arm, seemed to be urging a
claim of right, rather than of favour, to a lady whose age, and some
resemblance in their features, pointed her out as the mother of the
younger female, and who appeared to listen with a mixture of displeasure
and impatience.

Tinto produced his sketch with an air of mysterious triumph, and gazed
on it as a fond parent looks upon a hopeful child, while he anticipates
the future figure he is to make in the world, and the height to which
he will raise the honour of his family. He held it at arm’s length
from me--he helt it closer--he placed it upon the top of a chest of
drawers--closed the lower shutters of the casement, to adjust a downward
and favourable light--fell back to the due distance, dragging me
after him--shaded his face with his hand, as if to exclude all but the
favourite object--and ended by spoiling a child’s copy-book, which he
rolled up so as to serve for the darkened tube of an amateur. I fancy my
expressions of enthusiasm had not been in proportion to his own, for he
presently exclaimed with vehemence: “Mr. Pattieson, I used to think you
had an eye in your head.”

I vindicated my claim to the usual allowance of visual organs.

“Yet, on my honour,” said Dick, “I would swear you had been born blind,
since you have failed at the first glance to discover the subject and
meaning of that sketch. I do not mean to praise my own performance, I
leave these arts to others; I am sensible of my deficiencies, conscious
that my drawing and colouring may be improved by the time I intend
to dedicate to the art. But the conception--the expression--the
positions--these tell the story to every one who looks at the sketch;
and if I can finish the picture without diminution of the original
conception, the name of Tinto shall no more be smothered by the mists of
envy and intrigue.”

I replied: “That I admired the sketch exceedingly; but that to
understand its full merit, I felt it absolutely necessary to be informed
of the subject.”

“That is the very thing I complain of,” answered Tinto; “you have
accustomed yourself so much to these creeping twilight details of yours,
that you are become incapable of receiving that instant and vivid
flash of conviction which darts on the mind from seeing the happy and
expressive combinations of a single scene, and which gathers from the
position, attitude, and countenance of the moment, not only the history
of the past lives of the personages represented, and the nature of the
business on which they are immediately engaged, but lifts even the veil
of futurity, and affords a shrewd guess at their future fortunes.”

“In that case,” replied I, “Paining excels the ape of the renowned Gines
de Passamonte, which only meddled with the past and the present; nay,
she excels that very Nature who affords her subject; for I protest to
you, Dick, that were I permitted to peep into that Elizabeth-chamber,
and see the persons you have sketched conversing in flesh and blood, I
should not be a jot nearer guessing the nature of their business than I
am at this moment while looking at your sketch. Only generally, from
the languishing look of the young lady, and the care you have taken
to present a very handsome leg on the part of the gentleman, I presume
there is some reference to a love affair between them.”

“Do you really presume to form such a bold conjecture?” said Tinto. “And
the indignant earnestness with which you see the man urge his suit, the
unresisting and passive despair of the younger female, the stern air of
inflexible determination in the elder woman, whose looks express at
once consciousness that she is acting wrong and a firm determination to
persist in the course she has adopted----”

“If her looks express all this, my dear Tinto,” replied I, interrupting
him, “your pencil rivals the dramatic art of Mr. Puff in The Critic, who
crammed a whole complicated sentence into the expressive shake of Lord
Burleigh’s head.”

“My good friend, Peter,” replied Tinto, “I observe you are perfectly
incorrigible; however, I have compassion on your dulness, and am
unwilling you should be deprived of the pleasure of understanding my
picture, and of gaining, at the same time, a subject for your own pen.
You must know then, last summer, while I was taking sketches on the
coast of East Lothian and Berwickshire, I was seduced into the mountains
of Lammermoor by the account I received of some remains of antiquity in
that district. Those with which I was most struck were the ruins of an
ancient castle in which that Elizabeth-chamber, as you call it,
once existed. I resided for two or three days at a farmhouse in the
neighbourhood, where the aged goodwife was well acquainted with the
history of the castle, and the events which had taken place in it. One
of these was of a nature so interesting and singular, that my attention
was divided between my wish to draw the old ruins in landscape, and
to represent, in a history-piece, the singular events which have taken
place in it. Here are my notes of the tale,” said poor Dick, handing a
parcel of loose scraps, partly scratched over with his pencil, partly
with his pen, where outlines of caricatures, sketches of turrets,
mills, old gables, and dovecots, disputed the ground with his written
memoranda.

I proceeded, however, to decipher the substance of the manuscript
as well as I could, and move it into the following Tale, in which,
following in part, though not entirely, my friend Tinto’s advice, I
endeavoured to render my narrative rather descriptive than dramatic. My
favourite propensity, however, has at times overcome me, and my persons,
like many others in this talking world, speak now what then a great deal
more than they act.



CHAPTER II.

     Well, lord, we have not got that which we have;
     ‘Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
     Being opposites of such repairing nature.

     Henry VI. Part II.

IN the gorge of a pass or mountain glen, ascending from the fertile
plains of East Lothian, there stood in former times an extensive castle,
of which only the ruins are now visible. Its ancient proprietors were
a race of powerful and warlike carons, who bore the same name with the
castle itself, which was Ravenswood. Their line extended to a remote
period of antiquity, and they had intermarried with the Douglasses,
Humes, Swintons, Hays, and other families of power and distinction
in the same country. Their history was frequently involved in that of
Scotland itself, in whose annals their feats are recorded. The Castle of
Ravenswood, occupying, and in some measure commanding, a pass betweixt
Berwickshire, or the Merse, as the southeastern province of Scotland is
termed, and the Lothians, was of importance both in times of foreign
war and domestic discord. It was frequently beseiged with ardour, and
defended with obstinacy, and, of course, its owners played a conspicuous
part in story. But their house had its revolutions, like all sublunary
things: it became greatly declined from its splendour about the middle
of the 17th century; and towards the period of the Revolution, the last
proprietor of Ravenswood Castle saw himself compelled to part with the
ancient family seat, and to remove himself to a lonely and sea-beaten
tower, which, situated on the bleak shores between St. Abb’s Head and
the village of Eyemouth, looked out on the lonely and boisterous
German Ocean. A black domain of wild pasture-land surrounded their new
residence, and formed the remains of their property.

Lord Ravenswood, the heir of this ruined family, was far from bending
his mind to his new condition of life. In the civil war of 1689 he
had espoused the sinking side, and although he had escaped without the
forfeiture of life or land, his blood had been attainted, and his title
abolished. He was now called Lord Ravenswood only in courtesy.

This forfeited nobleman inherited the pride and turbulence, though not
the forture, of his house, and, as he imputed the final declension of
his family to a particular individual, he honoured that person with his
full portion of hatred. This was the very man who had now become, by
purchase, proprietor of Ravenswood, and the domains of which the heir of
the house now stood dispossessed. He was descended of a family much less
ancient than that of Lord Ravenswood, and which had only risen to wealth
and political importance during the great civil wars. He himself
had been bred to the bar, and had held high offices in the state,
maintaining through life the character of a skilful fisher in the
troubled waters of a state divided by factions, and governed by
delegated authority; and of one who contrived to amass considerable sums
of money in a country where there was but little to be gathered, and who
equally knew the value of wealth and the various means of augmenting it
and using it as an engine of increasing his power and influence.

Thus qualified and gifted, he was a dangerous antagonist to the fierce
and imprudent Ravenswood. Whether he had given him good cause for the
enmity with which the Baron regarded him, was a point on which men spoke
differently. Some said the quarrel arose merely from the vindictive
spirit and envy of Lord Ravenswood, who could not patiently behold
another, though by just and fair purchase, become the proprietor of
the estate and castle of his forefathers. But the greater part of the
public, prone to slander the wealthy in their absence as to flatter them
in their presence, held a less charitable opinion. They said that the
Lord Keeper (for to this height Sir William Ashton had ascended)
had, previous to the final purchase of the estate of Ravenswood,
been concerned in extensive pecuniary transactions with the former
proprietor; and, rather intimating what was probable than affirming
anything positively, they asked which party was likely to have the
advantage in stating and enforcing the claims arising out of these
complicated affairs, and more than hinted the advantages which the cool
lawyer and able politician must necessarily possess over the hot,
fiery, and imprudent character whom he had involved in legal toils and
pecuniary snares.

The character of the times aggravated these suspicions. “In those days
there was no king in Israel.” Since the departure of James VI. to assume
the richer and more powerful crown of England, there had existed in
Scotland contending parties, formed among the aristocracy, by whom,
as their intrigues at the court of St. James’s chanced to prevail,
the delegated powers of sovereignty were alternately swayed. The evils
attending upon this system of government resembled those which afflict
the tenants of an Irish estate, the property of an absentee. There was
no supreme power, claiming and possessing a general interest with the
community at large, to whom the oppressed might appeal from subordinate
tyranny, either for justice or for mercy. Let a monarch be as indolent,
as selfish, as much disposed to arbitrary power as he will, still, in a
free country, his own interests are so clearly connected with those of
the public at large, and the evil consequences to his own authority are
so obvious and imminent when a different course is pursued, that common
policy, as well as common feeling, point to the equal distribution of
justice, and to the establishment of the throne in righteousness. Thus,
even sovereigns remarkable for usurpation and tyranny have been found
rigorous in the administration of justice among their subjects, in cases
where their own power and passions were not compromised.

It is very different when the powers of sovereignty are delegated to
the head of an aristocratic faction, rivalled and pressed closely in
the race of ambition by an adverse leader. His brief and precarious
enjoyment of power must be employed in rewarding his partizans, in
extending his influence, in oppressing and crushing his adversaries.
Even Abou Hassan, the most disinterested of all viceroys, forgot not,
during his caliphate of one day, to send a douceur of one thousand
pieces of gold to his own household; and the Scottish vicegerents,
raised to power by the strength of their faction, failed not to embrace
the same means of rewarding them.

The administration of justice, in particular, was infected by the most
gross partiality. A case of importance scarcely occurred in which there
was not some ground for bias or partiality on the part of the judges,
who were so little able to withstand the temptation that the adage,
“Show me the man, and I will show you the law,” became as prevalent as
it was scandalous. One corruption led the way to others still mroe gross
and profligate. The judge who lent his sacred authority in one case to
support a friend, and in another to crush an enemy, and who decisions
were founded on family connexions or political relations, could not be
supposed inaccessible to direct personal motives; and the purse of the
wealthy was too often believed to be thrown into the scale to weigh
down the cause of the poor litigant. The subordinate officers of the law
affected little scruple concerning bribery. Pieces of plate and bags of
money were sent in presents to the king’s counsel, to influence their
conduct, and poured forth, says a contemporary writer, like billets of
wood upon their floors, without even the decency of concealment.

In such times, it was not over uncharitable to suppose that the
statesman, practised in courts of law, and a powerful member of a
triumphant cabal, might find and use means of advantage over his less
skilful and less favoured adversary; and if it had been supposed that
Sir William Ashton’s conscience had been too delicate to profit by these
advantages, it was believed that his ambition and desire of extending
his wealth and consequence found as strong a stimulus in the
exhortations of his lady as the daring aim of Macbeth in the days of
yore.

Lady Ashton was of a family more distinguished than that of her lord, an
advantage which she did not fail to use to the uttermost, in maintaining
and extending her husband’s influence over others, and, unless she
was greatly belied, her own over him. She had been beautiful, and was
stately and majestic in her appearance. Endowed by nature with strong
powers and violent passions, experience had taught her to employ the
one, and to conceal, if not to moderate, the other. She was a severe
adn strict observer of the external forms, at least, of devotion; her
hospitality was splendid, even to ostentation; her address and manners,
agreeable to the pattern most valued in Scotland at the period, were
grave, dignified, and severely regulated by the rules of etiquette. Her
character had always been beyond the breath of slander. And yet, with
all these qualities to excite respect, Lady Ashton was seldom mentioned
in the terms of love or affection. Interest--the interest of her family,
if not her own--seemed too obviously the motive of her actions; and
where this is the case, the sharp-judging and malignant public are not
easily imposed upon by outward show. It was seen and ascertained that,
in her most graceful courtesies and compliments, Lady Ashton no more
lost sight of her object than the falcon in his airy wheel turns his
quick eyes from his destined quarry; and hence, somethign of doubt and
suspicion qualified the feelings with which her equals received her
attentions. With her inferiors these feelings were mingled with fear;
an impression useful to her purposes, so far as it enforced ready
compliance with her requests and implicit obedience to her commands, but
detrimental, because it cannot exist with affection or regard.

Even her husband, it is said, upon whose fortunes her talents and
address had produced such emphatic influence, regarded her with
respectful awe rather than confiding attachment; and report said, there
were times when he considered his grandeur as dearly purchased at the
expense of domestic thraldom. Of this, however, much might be suspected,
but little could be accurately known: Lady Ashton regarded the honour of
her husband as her own, and was well aware how much that would suffer
in the public eye should he appear a vassal to his wife. In all her
arguments his opinion was quoted as infallible; his taste was appealed
to, and his sentiments received, with the air of deference which a
dutiful wife might seem to owe to a husband of Sir William Ashton’s rank
adn character. But there was something under all this which rung false
and hollow; and to those who watched this couple with close, and perhaps
malicious, scrutiny it seemed evident that, in the haughtiness of
a firmer character, higher birth, and more decided views of
aggrandisement, the lady looked with some contempt on her husband,
and that he regarded her with jealous fear, rather than with love or
admiration.

Still, however, the leading and favourite interests of Sir William
Ashton and his lady were the same, and they failed not to work in
concert, although without cordiality, and to testify, in all exterior
circumstances, that respect for each other which they were aware was
necessary to secure that of the public.

Their union was crowned with several children, of whom three survived.
One, the eldest son, was absent on his travels; the second, a girl of
seventeen, adn the third, a boy about three years younger, resided
with their parents in Edinburgh during the sessions of the Scottish
Parliament and Privy Council, at other times in the old Gothic castle
of Ravenswood, to which the Lord Keeper had made large additions in the
style of the 17th century.

Allan Lord Ravenswood, the late proprietor of that ancient mansion
adn the large estate annexed to it, continued for some time to wage
ineffectual war with his successor concerning various points to which
their former transactions had given rise, and which were successively
determined in favour of the wealthy and powerful competitor, until death
closed the litigation, by summoning Ravenswood to a higher bar. The
thread of life, which had been long wasting, gave way during a fit of
violent and impotent fury with which he was assailed on receiving the
news of the loss of a cause, founded, perhaps, rather in equity than in
law, the last which he had maintained against his powerful antagonist.
His son witnessed his dying agonies, and heard the curses which he
breathed against his adversary, as if they had conveyed to him a legacy
of vengeance. Other circumstances happened to exasperate a passion which
was, and had long been, a prevalent vice in the Scottish disposition.

It was a November morning, and the cliffs which overlooked the ocean
were hung with thick and heavy mist, when the portals of the ancient
and half-ruinous tower, in which Lord Ravenswood had spent the last and
troubled years of his life, opened, that his mortal remains might pass
forward to an abode yet more dreary and lonely. The pomp of attendance,
to which the deceased had, in his latter years, been a stranger, was
revived as he was about to be consigned to the realms of forgetfulness.

Banner after banner, with the various devices and coats of this ancient
family and its connexions, followed each other in mournful procession
from under the low-browed archway of the courtyard. The principal gentry
of the country attended in the deepest mourning, and tempered the
pace of their long train of horses to the solemn march befitting the
occasion. Trumpets, with banners of crape attached to them, sent
forth their long and melancholy notes to regulate the movements of the
procession. An immense train of inferior mourners and menials closed
the rear, which had not yet issued from the castle gate when the van had
reached the chapel where the body was to be deposited.

Contrary to the custom, and even to the law, of the time, the body was
met by a priest of the Scottish Episcopal communion, arrayed in his
surplice, and prepared to read over the coffin of the deceased the
funeral service of the church. Such had been the desire of Lord
Ravenswood in his last illness, and it was readily complied with by the
Tory gentlemen, or Cavaliers, as they affected to style themselves, in
which faction most of his kinsmen were enrolled. The Presbyterian Church
judicatory of the bounds, considering the ceremony as a bravading insult
upon their authority, had applied to the Lord Keeper, as the nearest
privy councillor, for a warrant to prevent its being carried into
effect; so that, when the clergyman had opened his prayer-book, an
officer of the law, supported by some armed men, commanded him to be
silent. An insult which fired the whol assembly with indignation was
particularly and instantly resented by the only son of the deceased,
Edgar, popularly called the Master of Ravenswood, a youth of about
twenty years of age. He clapped his hand on his sword, and bidding
the official person to desist at his peril from farther interruption,
commanded the clergyman to proceed. The man attempted to enforce his
commission; but as an hundred swords at once glittered in the air, he
contented himself with protesting against the violence which had been
offered to him in the execution of his duty, and stood aloof, a sullen
adn moody spectator of the ceremonial, muttering as one who should say:
“You’ll rue the day that clogs me with this answer.”

The scene was worthy of an artist’s pencil. Under the very arch of the
house of death, the clergyman, affrighted at the scene, and trembling
for his own safety, hastily and unwillingly rehearsed the solemn service
of the church, and spoke “dust to dust and ashes to ashes,” over
ruined pride and decayed prosperity. Around stood the relations of the
deceased, their countenances more in anger than in sorrow, and the drawn
swords which they brandished forming a violent contrast with their deep
mourning habits. In the countenance of the young man alone, resentment
seemed for the moment overpowered by the deep agony with which he beheld
his nearest, and almost his only, friend consigned to the tomb of his
ancestry. A relative observed him turn deadly pale, when, all rites
being now duly observed, it became the duty of the chief mourner to
lower down into the charnel vault, where mouldering coffins showed their
tattered velvet and decayed plating, the head of the corpse which was
to be their partner in corruption. He stept to the youth and offered his
assistance, which, by a mute motion, Edgar Ravenswood rejected. Firmly,
and without a tear, he performed that last duty. The stone was laid
on the sepulchre, the door of the aisle was locked, and the youth took
possession of its massive key.

As the crowd left the chapel, he paused on the steps which led to its
Gothic chancel. “Gentlemen and friends,” he said, “you have this day
done no common duty to the body of your deceased kinsman. The rites of
due observance, which, in other countries, are allowed as the due of the
meanest Christian, would this day have been denied to the body of your
relative--not certainly sprung of the meanest house in Scotland--had
it not been assured to him by your courage. Others bury their dead in
sorrow and tears, in silence and in reverence; our funeral rites are
marred by the intrusion of bailiffs and ruffians, and our grief--the
grief due to our departed friend--is chased from our cheeks by the glow
of just indignation. But it is well that I know from what quiver this
arrow has come forth. It was only he that dug the drave who could have
the mean cruelty to disturb the obsequies; and Heaven do as much to
me and more, if I requite not to this man and his house the ruin and
disgrace he has brought on me and mine!”

A numerous part of the assembly applauded this speech, as the spirited
expression of just resentment; but the more cool and judicious regretted
that it had been uttered. The fortunes of the heir of Ravenswood were
too low to brave the farther hostility which they imagined these open
expressions of resentment must necessarily provoke. Their apprehensions,
however, proved groundless, at least in the immediate consequences of
this affair.

The mourners returned to the tower, there, according to a custom but
recently abolished in Scotland, to carouse deep healths to the memory of
the deceased, to make the house of sorrow ring with sounds of joviality
and debauch, and to diminish, by the expense of a large and profuse
entertainment, the limited revenues of the heir of him whose funeral
they thus strangely honoured. It was the custom, however, and on the
present occasion it was fully observed. The tables swam in wine,
the populace feasted in the courtyard, the yeomen in the kitchen and
buttery; and two years’ rent of Ravenswood’s remaining property hardly
defrayed the charge of the funeral revel. The wine did its office on all
but the Master of Ravenswood, a title which he still retained, though
forfeiture had attached to that of his father. He, while passing around
the cup which he himself did not taste, soon listened to a thousand
exclamations against the Lord Keeper, and passionate protestations of
attachment to himself, and to the honour of his house. He listened
with dark and sullen brow to ebullitions which he considered justly as
equally evanescent with the crimson bubbles on the brink of the goblet,
or at least with the vapours which its contents excited in the brains of
the revellers around him.

When the last flask was emptied, they took their leave with deep
protestations--to be forgotten on the morrow, if, indeed, those who
made them should not think it necessary for their safety to make a more
solemn retractation.

Accepting their adieus with an air of contempt which he could scarce
conceal, Ravenswood at length beheld his ruinous habitation cleared of
their confluence of riotous guests, and returned to the deserted hall,
which now appeared doubly lonely from the cessation of that clamour to
which it had so lately echoed. But its space was peopled by phantoms
which the imagination of the young heir conjured up before him--the
tarnished honour and degraded fortunes of his house, the destruction
of his own hopes, and the triumph of that family by whom they had been
ruined. To a mind naturally of a gloomy cast here was ample room
for meditation, and the musings of young Ravenswood were deep and
unwitnessed.

The peasant who shows the ruins of the tower, which still crown the
beetling cliff and behold the war of the waves, though no mroe tenanted
saved by the sea-mew and cormorant, even yet affirms that on this
fatal night the Master of Ravenswood, by the bitter exclamations of his
despair, evoked some evil fiend, under whose malignant influence the
future tissue of incidents was woven. Alas! what fiend can suggest more
desperate counsels than those adopted under the guidance of our own
violent and unresisted passions?



CHAPTER III.

     Over Gods forebode, then said the King,
     That thou shouldst shoot at me.

     William Bell, Clim ‘o the Cleugh, etc.

On the morning after the funeral, the legal officer whose authority
had been found insufficient to effect an interruption of the funeral
solemnities of the late Lord Ravenswood, hastened to state before the
Keeper the resistance which he had met with in the execution of his
office.

The statesman was seated in a spacious library, once a banqueting-room
in the old Castle of Ravenswood, as was evident from the armorial
insignia still displayed on the carved roof, which was vaulted with
Spanish chestnut, and on the stained glass of the casement, through
which gleamed a dim yet rich light on the long rows of shelves, bending
under the weight of legal commentators and monkish historians, whose
ponderous volumes formed the chief and most valued contents of a
Scottish historian [library] of the period. On the massive oaken
table and reading-desk lay a confused mass of letters, petitions, and
parchments; to toil amongst which was the pleasure at once and the
plague of Sir William Ashton’s life. His appearance was grave and even
noble, well becoming one who held an high office in the state; and it
was not save after long and intimate conversation with him upon topics
of pressing and personal interest, that a stranger could have discovered
something vacillating and uncertain in his resolutions; an infirmity of
purpose, arising from a cautious and timid disposition, which, as he was
conscious of its internal influence on his mind, he was, from pride as
well as policy, most anxious to conceal from others. He listened with
great apparent composure to an exaggerated account of the tumult which
had taken place at the funeral, of the contempt thrown on his own
authority and that of the church and state; nor did he seem moved even
by the faithful report of the insulting and threatening language which
had been uttered by young Ravenswood and others, and obviously directed
against himself. He heard, also, what the man had been able to collect,
in a very distorted and aggravated shape, of the toasts which had been
drunk, and the menaces uttered, at the subsequent entertainment. In fine,
he made careful notes of all these particulars, and of the names of
the persons by whom, in case of need, an accusation, founded upon these
violent proceedings, could be witnessed and made good, and dismissed his
informer, secure that he was now master of the remaining fortune, and
even of the personal liberty, of young Ravenswood.

When the door had closed upon the officer of the law, the Lord Keeper
remained for a moment in deep meditation; then, starting from his
seat, paced the apartment as one about to take a sudden and energetic
resolution. “Young Ravenswood,” he muttered, “is now mine--he is my own;
he has placed himself in my hand, and he shall bend or break. I have not
forgot the determined and dogged obstinacy with which his father fought
every point to the last, resisted every effort at compromise, embroiled
me in lawsuits, and attempted to assail my character when he could
not otherwise impugn my rights. This boy he has left behind him--this
Edgar--this hot-headed, hare-brained fool, has wrecked his vessel before
she has cleared the harbor. I must see that he gains no advantage
of some turning tide which may again float him off. These memoranda,
properly stated to the privy council, cannot but be construed into
an aggravated riot, in which the dignity both of the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities stands committed. A heavy fine might be
imposed; an order for committing him to Edinburgh or Blackness Castle
seems not improper; even a charge of treason might be laid on many of
these words and expressions, though God forbid I should prosecute the
matter to that extent. No, I will not; I will not touch his life, even
if it should be in my power; and yet, if he lives till a change of
times, what follows? Restitution--perhaps revenge. I know Athole
promised his interest to old Ravenswood, and here is his son already
bandying and making a faction by his own contemptible influence. What
a ready tool he would be for the use of those who are watching the
downfall of our administration!”

While these thoughts were agitating the mind of the wily statesman, and
while he was persuading himself that his own interest and safety, as
well as those of his friends and party, depended on using the present
advantage to the uttermost against young Ravenswood, the Lord Keeper
sate down to his desk, and proceeded to draw up, for the information of
the privy council, an account of the disorderly proceedings which,
in contempt of his warrant, had taken place at the funeral of Lord
Ravenswood. The names of most of the parties concerned, as well as the
fact itself, would, he was well aware, sound odiously in the ears of his
colleagues in administration, and most likely instigate them to make an
example of young Ravenswood, at least, in terrorem.

It was a point of delicacy, however, to select such expressions as might
infer the young man’s culpability, without seeming directly to urge
it, which, on the part of Sir William Ashton, his father’s ancient
antagonist, could not but appear odious and invidious. While he was in
the act of composition, labouring to find words which might indicate
Edgar Ravenswood to be the cause of the uproar, without specifically
making such a charge, Sir William, in a pause of his task, chanced, in
looking upward, to see the crest of the family for whose heir he was
whetting the arrows and disposing the toils of the law carved upon one
of the corbeilles from which the vaulted roof of the apartment sprung.
It was a black bull’s head, with the legend, “I bide my time”; and
the occasion upon which it was adopted mingled itself singularly and
impressively with the subject of his present reflections.

It was said by a constant tradition that a Malisius de Ravenswood had,
in the 13th century, been deprived of his castle and lands by a powerful
usurper, who had for a while enjoyed his spoils in quiet. At length,
on the eve of a costly banquet, Ravenswood, who had watched his
opportunity, introduced himself into the castle with a small band of
faithful retainers. The serving of the expected feast was impatiently
looked for by the guests, and clamorously demanded by the temporary
master of the castle. Ravenswood, who had assumed the disguise of a
sewer upon the occasion, answered, in a stern voice, “I bide my time”;
and at the same moment a bull’s head, the ancient symbol of death, was
placed upon the table. The explosion of the conspiracy took place upon
the signal, and the usurper and his followers were put to death. Perhaps
there was something in this still known and often repeated story which
came immediately home to the breast and conscience of the Lord Keeper;
for, putting from him the paper on which he had begun his report, and
carefully locking the memoranda which he had prepared into a cabinet
which stood beside him, he proceeded to walk abroad, as if for
the purpose of collecting his ideas, and reflecting farther on the
consequences of the step which he was about to take, ere yet they became
inevitable.

In passing through a large Gothic ante-room, Sir William Ashton heard
the sound of his daughter’s lute. Music, when the performers are
concealed, affects us with a pleasure mingled with surprise, and
reminds us of the natural concert of birds among the leafy bowers. The
statesman, though little accustomed to give way to emotions of this
natural and simple class, was still a man and a father. He stopped,
therefore, and listened, while the silver tones of Lucy Ashton’s voice
mingled with the accompaniment in an ancient air, to which some one had
adapted the following words:

     “Look not thou on beauty’s charming,
     Sit thou still when kings are arming,
     Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,
     Speak not when the people listens,
     Stop thine ear against the singer,
     From the red gold keep they finger,
     Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,
     Easy live and quiet die.”

The sounds ceased, and the Keeper entered his daughter’s apartment.

The words she had chosen seemed particularly adapted to her character;
for Lucy Ashton’s exquisitely beautiful, yet somewhat girlish features
were formed to express peace of mind, serenity, and indifference to
the tinsel of wordly pleasure. Her locks, which were of shadowy gold,
divided on a brow of exquisite whiteness, like a gleam of broken and
pallid sunshine upon a hill of snow. The expression of the countenance
was in the last degree gentle, soft, timid, and feminine, and seemed
rather to shrink from the most casual look of a stranger than to court
his admiration. Something there was of a Madonna cast, perhaps the
result of delicate health, and of residence in a family where the
dispositions of the inmates were fiercer, more active, and energetic
than her own.

Yet her passiveness of disposition was by no means owing to an
indifferent or unfeeling mind. Left to the impulse of her own taste and
feelings, Lucy Ashton was peculiarly accessible to those of a romantic
cast. Her secret delight was in the old legendary tales of ardent
devotion and unalterable affection, chequered as they so often are with
strange adventures and supernatural horrors. This was her favoured
fairy realm, and here she erected her aerial palaces. But it was only
in secret that she laboured at this delusive though delightful
architecture. In her retired chamber, or in the woodland bower which
she had chosen for her own, and called after her name, she was in fancy
distributing the prizes at the tournament, or raining down influence
from her eyes on the valiant combatants: or she was wandering in the
wilderness with Una, under escort of the generous lion; or she was
identifying herself with the simple yet noble-minded Miranda in the isle
of wonder and enchantment.

But in her exterior relations to things of this world, Lucy willingly
received the ruling impulse from those around her. The alternative was,
in general, too indifferent to her to render resistance desirable, and
she willingly found a motive for decision in the opinion of her friends
which perhaps she might have sought for in vain in her own choice.
Every reader must have observed in some family of his acquaintance some
individual of a temper soft and yielding, who, mixed with stronger and
more ardent minds, is borne along by the will of others, with as little
power of opposition as the flower which is flung into a running stream.
It usually happens that such a compliant and easy disposition, which
resigns itself without murmur to the guidance of others, becomes the
darling of those to whose inclinations its own seem to be offered, in
ungrudging and ready sacrifice. This was eminently the case with Lucy
Ashton. Her politic, wary, and wordly father felt for her an affection
the strength of which sometimes surprised him into an unusual emotion.
Her elder brother, who trode the path of ambition with a haughtier step
than his father, had also more of human affection. A soldier, and in
a dissolute age, he preferred his sister Lucy even to pleasure and to
military preferment and distinction. Her younger brother, at an age when
trifles chiefly occupied his mind, made her the confidante of all his
pleasures and anxieties, his success in field-sports, and his quarrels
with his tutor and instructors. To these details, however trivial, Lucy
lent patient and not indifferent attention. They moved and interested
Henry, and that was enough to secure her ear.

Her mother alone did not feel that distinguished and predominating
affection with which the rest of the family cherished Lucy. She regarded
what she termed her daughter’s want of spirit as a decided mark that the
more plebeian blood of her father predominated in Lucy’s veins, and used
to call her in derision her Lammermoor Shepherdess. To dislike so gentle
and inoffensive a being was impossible; but Lady Ashton preferred her
eldest son, on whom had descended a large portion of her own ambitious
and undaunted disposition, to a daughter whose softness of temper seemed
allied to feebleness of mind. Her eldest son was the more partially
beloved by his mother because, contrary to the usual custom of Scottish
families of distinction, he had been named after the head of the house.

“My Sholto,” she said, “will support the untarnished honour of his
maternal house, and elevate and support that of his father. Poor Lucy
is unfit for courts or crowded halls. Some country laird must be her
husband, rich enough to supply her with every comfort, without an effort
on her own part, so that she may have nothing to shed a tear for but the
tender apprehension lest he may break his neck in a foxchase. It was
not so, however, that our house was raised, nor is it so that it can be
fortified and augmented. The Lord Keeper’s dignity is yet new; it must
be borne as if we were used to its weight, worthy of it, and prompt
to assert and maintain it. Before ancient authorities men bend from
customary and hereditary deference; in our presence they will stand
erect, unless they are compelled to prostrate themselves. A daughter
fit for the sheepfold or the cloister is ill qualified to exact respect
where it is yielded with reluctance; and since Heaven refused us a third
boy, Lucy should have held a character fit to supply his place. The
hour will be a happy one which disposes her hand in marriage to some one
whose energy is greater than her own, or whose ambition is of as low an
order.”

So meditated a mother to whom the qualities of her children’s hearts,
as well as the prospect of their domestic happiness, seemed light in
comparison to their rank and temporal greatness. But, like many a parent
of hot and impatient character, she was mistaken in estimating
the feelings of her daughter, who, under a semblance of extreme
indifference, nourished the germ of those passions which sometimes
spring up in one night, like the gourd of the prophet, and astonish
the observer by their unexpected ardour and intensity. In fact, Lucy’s
sentiments seemed chill because nothing had occurred to interest or
awaken them. Her life had hitherto flowed on in a uniform and gentle
tenor, and happy for her had not its present smoothness of current
resembled that of the stream as it glides downwards to the waterfall!

“So, Lucy,” said her father, entering as her song was ended, “does your
musical philosopher teach you to contemn the world before you know it?
That is surely something premature. Or did you but speak according to
the fashion of fair maidens, who are always to hold the pleasures of
life in contempt till they are pressed upon them by the address of some
gentle knight?”

Lucy blushed, disclaimed any inference respecting her own choice
being drawn from her selection of a song, and readily laid aside her
instrument at her father’s request that she would attend him in his
walk.

A large and well-wooded park, or rather chase, stretched along the
hill behind the castle, which, occupying, as we have noticed, a pass
ascending from the plain, seemed built in its very gorge to defend
the forest ground which arose behind it in shaggy majesty. Into this
romantic region the father and daughter proceeded, arm in arm, by a
noble avenue overarched by embowering elms, beneath which groups of the
fallow-deer were seen to stray in distant perspective. As they paced
slowly on, admiring the different points of view, for which Sir
William Ashton, notwithstanding the nature of his usual avocations, had
considerable taste and feeling, they were overtaken by the forester,
or park-keeper, who, intent on silvan sport, was proceeding with his
crossbow over his arm, and a hound led in leash by his boy, into the
interior of the wood.

“Going to shoot us a piece of venison, Norman?” said his master, as he
returned the woodsman’s salutation.

“Saul, your honour, and that I am. Will it please you to see the sport?”

“Oh no,” said his lordship, after looking at his daughter, whose colour
fled at the idea of seeing the deer shot, although, had her father
expressed his wish that they should accompany Norman, it was probable
she would not even have hinted her reluctance.

The forester shrugged his shoulders. “It was a disheartening thing,”
 he said, “when none of the gentles came down to see the sport. He
hoped Captain Sholto would be soon hame, or he might shut up his shop
entirely; for Mr. Harry was kept sae close wi’ his Latin nonsense that,
though his will was very gude to be in the wood from morning till night,
there would be a hopeful lad lost, and no making a man of him. It was
not so, he had heard, in Lord Ravenswood’s time: when a buck was to be
killed, man and mother’s son ran to see; and when the deer fell, the
knife was always presented to the knight, and he never gave less than
a dollar for the compliment. And there was Edgar Ravenswood--Master of
Ravenswood that is now--when he goes up to the wood--there hasna been a
better hunter since Tristrem’s time--when Sir Edgar hauds out, down goes
the deer, faith. But we hae lost a’ sense of woodcraft on this side of
the hill.”

There was much in this harangue highly displeasing to the Lord Keeper’s
feelings; he could not help observing that his menial despised him
almost avowedly for not possessing that taste for sport which in those
times was deemed the natural and indispensable attribute of a real
gentleman. But the master of the game is, in all country houses, a man
of great importance, and entitled to use considerable freedom of speech.
Sir William, therefore, only smiled and replied, “He had something else
to think upon to-day than killing deer”; meantime, taking out his purse,
he gave the ranger a dollar for his encouragement. The fellow received
it as the waiter of a fashionable hotel receives double his proper fee
from the hands of a country gentleman--that is, with a smile, in which
pleasure at the gift is mingled with contempt for the ignorance of the
donor. “Your honour is the bad paymaster,” he said, “who pays before it
is done. What would you do were I to miss the buck after you have paid
me my wood-fee?”

“I suppose,” said the Keeper, smiling, “you would hardly guess what I
mean were I to tell you of a condictio indebiti?”

“Not I, on my saul. I guess it is some law phrase; but sue a beggar,
and--your honour knows what follows. Well, but I will be just with
you, and if bow and brach fail not, you shall have a piece of game two
fingers fat on the brisket.”

As he was about to go off, his master again called him, and asked, as
if by accident, whether the Master of Ravenswood was actually so brave a
man and so good a shooter as the world spoke him.

“Brave!--brave enough, I warrant you,” answered Norman. “I was in the
wood at Tyninghame when there was a sort of gallants hunting with my
lord; on my saul, there was a buck turned to bay made us all stand
back--a stout old Trojan of the first head, ten-tyned branches, and a
brow as broad as e’er a bullock’s. Egad, he dashed at the old lord, and
there would have been inlake among the perrage, if the Master had not
whipt roundly in, and hamstrung him with his cutlass. He was but sixteen
then, bless his heart!”

“And is he as ready with the gun as with the couteau?” said Sir William.

“He’ll strike this silver dollar out from between my finger and thumb at
fourscore yards, and I’ll hold it out for a gold merk; what more would
ye have of eye, hand, lead, and gunpowder?” “Oh, no more to be wished,
certainly,” said the Lord Keeper; “but we keep you from your sport,
Norman. Good morrow, good Norman.”

And, humming his rustic roundelay, the yeoman went on his road, the
sound of his rough voice gradually dying away as the distance betwixt
them increased:

     “The monk must arise when the matins ring,
     The abbot may sleep to their chime;
     But the yeoman must start when the bugles sing
     ‘Tis time, my hearts, ‘tis time.

     There’s bucks and raes on Bilhope braes,
     There’s a herd on Shortwood Shaw;
     But a lily-white doe in the garden goes,
     She’s fairly worth them a’.”

“Has this fellow,” said the Lord Keeper, when the yeoman’s song had died
on the wind, “ever served the Ravenswood people, that he seems so much
interested in them? I suppose you know, Lucy, for you make it a point
of conscience to record the special history of every boor about the
castle.”

“I am not quite so faithful a chronicler, my dear father; but I
believe that Norman once served here while a boy, and before he went to
Ledington, whence you hired him. But if you want to know anything of the
former family, Old Alice is the best authority.”

“And what should I have to do with them, pray, Lucy,” said her father,
“or with their history or accomplishments?”

“Nay, I do not know, sir; only that you were asking questions of Norman
about young Ravenswood.”

“Pshaw, child!” replied her father, yet immediately added: “And who is
Old Alice? I think you know all the old women in the country.”

“To be sure I do, or how could I help the old creatures when they are
in hard times? And as to Old Alice, she is the very empress of old women
and queen of gossips, so far as legendary lore is concerned. She is
blind, poor old soul, but when she speaks to you, you would think she
has some way of looking into your very heart. I am sure I often cover
my face, or turn it away, for it seems as if she saw one change colour,
though she has been blind these twenty years. She is worth visiting,
were it but to say you have seen a blind and paralytic old woman have so
much acuteness of perception and dignity of manners. I assure you, she
might be a countess from her language and behaviour. Come, you must go
to see Alice; we are not a quarter of a mile from her cottage.”

“All this, my dear,” said the Lord Keeper, “is no answer to my
question, who this woman is, and what is her connexion with the former
proprietor’s family?”

“Oh, it was somethign of a nouriceship, I believe; and she remained
here, because her two grandsons were engaged in your service. But it
was against her will, I fancy; for the poor old creature is always
regretting the change of times and of property.”

“I am much obliged to her,” answered the Lord Keeper. “She and her folk
eat my bread and drink my cup, and are lamenting all the while that
they are not still under a family which never could do good, either to
themselves or any one else!”

“Indeed,” replied Lucy, “I am certain you do Old Alice injustice.
She has nothing mercenary about her, and would not accept a penny
in charity, if it were to save her from being starved. She is only
talkative, like all old folk when you put them upon stories of their
youth; and she speaks about the Ravenswood people, because she lived
under them so many years. But I am sure she is grateful to you, sir,
for your protection, and that she would rather speak to you than to
any other person in the whole world beside. Do, sir, come and see Old
Alice.”

And with the freedom of an indulged daughter she dragged the Lord Keeper
in the direction she desired.





CHAPTER IV.

     Through tops of the high trees she did descry
     A little smoke, whose vapour, thin and light,
     Reeking aloft, uprolled to the sky,
     Which cheerful sign did send unto her sight,
     That in the same did wonne some living wight.

     SPENSER.

LUCY acted as her father’s guide, for he was too much engrossed with his
political labours, or with society, to be perfectly acquainted with his
own extensive domains, and, moreover, was generally an inhabitant of
the city of Edinburgh; and she, on the other hand, had, with her mother,
resided the whole summer in Ravenswood, and, partly from taste, partly
from want of any other amusement, had, by her frequent rambles, learned
to know each lane, alley, dingle, or bushy dell,


     And every bosky bourne from side to side.


We have said that the Lord Keeper was not indifferent to the beauties
of nature; and we add, in justice to him, that he felt them doubly when
pointed out by the beautiful, simple, and interesting girl who, hanging
on his arm with filial kindness, now called him to admire the size of
some ancient oak, and now the unexpected turn where the path, developing
its maze from glen or dingle, suddenly reached an eminence commanding
an extensive view of the plains beneath them, and then gradually glided
away from the prospect to lose itself among rocks and thickets, and
guide to scenes of deeper seclusion.

It was when pausing on one of those points of extensive and commanding
view that Lucy told her father they were close by the cottage of her
blind protegee; and on turning from the little hill, a path which led
around it, worn by the daily steps of the infirm inmate, brought them in
sight of the hut, which, embosomed in a deep and obscure dell, seemed
to have been so situated purposely to bear a correspondence with the
darkened state of its inhabitant.

The cottage was situated immediately under a tall rock, which in
some measure beetled over it, as if threatening to drop some detached
fragment from its brow on the frail tenement beneath. The hut itself was
constructed of turf and stones, and rudely roofed over with thatch, much
of which was in a dilapidated condition. The thin blue smoke rose from
it in a light column, and curled upward along the white face of the
incumbent rock, giving the scene a tint of exquisite softness. In a
small and rude garden, surrounded by straggling elder-bushes, which
formed a sort of imperfect hedge, sat near to the beehives, by the
produce of which she lived, that “woman old” whom Lucy had brought her
father hither to visit.

Whatever there had been which was disastrous in her fortune, whatever
there was miserable in her dwelling, it was easy to judge by the first
glance that neither years, poverty, misfortune, nor infirmity had broken
the spirit of this remarkable woman.

She occupied a turf seat, placed under a weeping birch of unusual
magnitude and age, as Judah is represented sitting under her palm-tree,
with an air at once of majesty and of dejection. Her figure was tall,
commanding, and but little bent by the infirmities of old age. Her
dress, though that of a peasant, was uncommonly clean, forming in that
particular a strong contrast to most of her rank, and was disposed with
an attention to neatness, and even to taste, equally unusual. But it was
her expression of countenance which chiefly struck the spectator, and
induced most persons to address her with a degree of deference and
civility very inconsistent with the miserable state of her dwelling, and
which, nevertheless, she received with that easy composure which showed
she felt it to be her due. She had once been beautiful, but her beauty
had been of a bold and masculine cast, such as does not survive the
bloom of youth; yet her features continued to express strong sense, deep
reflection, and a character of sober pride, which, as we have already
said of her dress, appeared to argue a conscious superiority to those
of her own rank. It scarce seemed possible that a face, deprived of the
advantage of sight, could have expressed character so strongly; but her
eyes, which were almost totally closed, did not, by the display of their
sightless orbs, mar the countenance to which they could add nothing. She
seemed in a ruminating posture, soothed, perhaps, by the murmurs of the
busy tribe around her to abstraction, though not to slumber.

Lucy undid the latch of the little garden gate, and solicited the old
woman’s attention. “My father, Alice, is come to see you.”

“He is welcome, Miss Ashton, and so are you,” said the old woman,
turning and inclining her head towards her visitors.

“This is a fine morning for your beehives, mother,” said the Lord
Keeper, who, struck with the outward appearance of Alice, was somewhat
curious to know if her conversation would correspond with it.

“I believe so, my lord,” she replied; “I feel the air breathe milder
than of late.”

“You do not,” resumed the statesman, “take charge of these bees
yourself, mother? How do you manage them?”

“By delegates, as kings do their subjects,” resumed Alice; “and I am
fortunate in a prime minister. Here, Babie.”

She whistled on a small silver call which ung around her neck, and which
at that time was sometimes used to summon domestics, and Babie, a girl
of fifteen, made her appearance from the hut, not altogether so cleanly
arrayed as she would probably have been had Alice had the use of her
yees, but with a greater air of neatness than was upon the whole to have
been expected.

“Babie,” said her mistress, “offer some bread and honey to the Lord
Keeper and Miss Ashton; they will excuse your awkwardness if you use
cleanliness and despatch.”

Babie performed her mistress’s command with the grace which was
naturally to have been expected, moving to and fro with a lobster-like
gesture, her feet and legs tending one way, while her head, turned in
a different direction, was fixed in wonder upon the laird, who was more
frequently heard of than seen by his tenants and dependants. The bread
and honey, however, deposited on a plantain leaf, was offered and
accepted in all due courtesy. The Lord Keeper, still retaining the place
which he had occupied on the decayed trunk of a fallen tree, looked
as if he wished to prolong the interview, but was at a loss how to
introduce a suitable subject.

“You have been long a resident on this property?” he said, after a
pause.

“It is now nearly sixty years since I first knew Ravenswood,” answered
the old dame, whose conversation, though perfectly civil and respectful,
seemed cautiously limited to the unavoidable and necessary task of
replying to Sir William.

“You are not, I should judge by your accent, of this country
originally?” said the Lord Keeper, in continuation.

“No; I am by birth an Englishwoman.” “Yet you seem attached to this
country as if it were your own.”

“It is here,” replied the blind woman, “that I have drank the cup of joy
and of sorrow which Heaven destined for me. I was here the wife of an
upright and affectionate husband for more than twenty years; I was here
the mother of six promising children; it was here that God deprived me
of all these blessings; it was here they died, and yonder, by yon ruined
chapel, they lie all buried. I had no country but theirs while they
lived; I have none but theirs now they are no more.”

“But your house,” said the Lord Keeper, looking at it, “is miserably
ruinous?”

“Do, my dear father,” said Lucy, eagerly, yet bashfully, catching at the
hint, “give orders to make it better; that is, if you think it proper.”

“It will last my time, my dear Miss Lucy,” said the blind woman; “I
would not have my lord give himself the least trouble about it.”

“But,” said Lucy, “you once had a much better house, and were rich, and
now in your old age to live in this hovel!”

“It is as good as I deserve, Miss Lucy; if my heart has not broke with
what I have suffered, and seen others suffer, it must have been strong
enough, adn the rest of this old frame has no right to call itself
weaker.”

“You have probably witnessed many changes,” said the Lord Keeper; “but
your experience must have taught you to expect them.”

“It has taught me to endure them, my lord,” was the reply.

“Yet you knew that they must needs arrive in the course of years?” said
the statesman.

“Ay; as I knew that the stump, on or beside which you sit, once a tall
and lofty tree, must needs one day fall by decay, or by the axe; yet
I hoped my eyes might not witness the downfall of the tree which
overshadowed my dwelling.”

“Do not suppose,” said the Lord Keeper, “that you will lose any interest
with me for looking back with regret to the days when another family
possessed my estates. You had reason, doubtless, to love them, and I
respect your gratitude. I will order some repairs in your cottage, and I
hope we shall live to be friends when we know each other better.” “Those
of my age,” returned the dame, “make no new friends. I thank you for
your bounty, it is well intended undoubtedly; but I have all I want, and
I cannot accept more at your lordship’s hand.”

“Well, then,” continued the Lord Keeper, “at least allow me to say,
that I look upon you as a woman of sense and education beyond your
appearance, and that I hope you will continue to reside on this property
of mine rent-free for your life.”

“I hope I shall,” said the old dame, composedly; “I believe that was
made an article in the sale of Ravenswood to your lordship, though such
a trifling circumstance may have escaped your recollection.”

“I remember--I recollect,” said his lordship, somewhat confused. “I
perceive you are too much attached to your old friends to accept any
benefit from their successor.”

“Far from it, my lord; I am grateful for the benefits which I decline,
and I wish I could pay you for offering them, better than what I am now
about to say.” The Lord Keeper looked at her in some surprise, but said
not a word. “My lord,” she continued, in an impressive and solemn tone,
“take care what you do; you are on the brink of a precipice.”

“Indeed?” said the Lord Keeper, his mind reverting to the political
circumstances of the country. “Has anything come to your knowledge--any
plot or conspiracy?”

“No, my lord; those who traffic in such commodities do not call to their
councils the old, blind, and infirm. My warning is of another kind. You
have driven matters hard with the house of Ravenswood. Believe a true
tale: they are a fierce house, and there is danger in dealing with men
when they become desperate.”

“Tush,” answered the Keeper; “what has been between us has been the work
of the law, not my doing; and to the law they must look, if they would
impugn my proceedings.”

“Ay, but they may think otherwise, and take the law into their own hand,
when they fail of other means of redress.”

“What mean you?” said the Lord Keeper. “Young Ravenswood would not have
recourse to personal violence?”

“God forbid I should say so! I know nothing of the youth but what is
honourable and open. Honourable and open, said I? I should have added,
free, generous, noble. But he is still a Ravenswood, and may bide his
time. Remember the fate of Sir George Lockhart.”

The Lord Keeper started as she called to his recollection a tragedy
so deep and so recent. The old woman proceeded: “Chiesley, who did the
deed, was a relative of Lord Ravenswood. In the hall of Ravenswood, in
my presence and in that of others, he avowed publicly his determination
to do the cruelty which he afterwards committed. I could not keep
silence, though to speak it ill became my station. ‘You are devising a
dreadful crime,’ I said, ‘for which you must reckon before the judgment
seat.’ Never shall I forget his look, as he replied, ‘I must reckon then
for many things, and will reckon for this also.’ Therefore I may well
say, beware of pressing a desperate man with the hand of authority.
There is blood of Chiesley in the veins of Ravenswood, and one drop of
it were enough to fire him in the circumstances in which he is placed. I
say, beware of him.”

The old dame had, either intentionally or by accident, harped aright
the fear of the Lord Keeper. The desperate and dark resource of private
assassination, so familiar to a Scottish baron in former times, had even
in the present age been too frequently resorted to under the pressure of
unusual temptation, or where the mind of the actor was prepared for
such a crime. Sir William Ashton was aware of this; as also that young
Ravenswood had received injuries sufficient to prompt him to that sort
of revenge, which becomes a frequent though fearful consequence of the
partial administration of justice. He endeavoured to disguise from
Alice the nature of the apprehensions which he entertained; but so
ineffectually, that a person even of less penetration than nature had
endowed her with must necessarily have been aware that the subject lay
near his bosom. His voice was changed in its accent as he replied to
her, “That the Master of Ravenswood was a man of honour; and, were it
otherwise, that the fate of Chiesley of Dalry was a sufficient warning
to any one who should dare to assume the office of avenger of his own
imaginary wrongs.” And having hastily uttered these expressions, he rose
and left the place without waiting for a reply.




CHAPTER V.

     Is she a Capulet?
     O dear account! my life is my foe’s debt.

     SHAKESPEARE

THE Lord Keeper walked for nearly a quarter of a mile in profound
silence. His daughter, naturally timid, and bred up in those ideas of
filial awe and implicit obedience which were inculcated upon the youth
of that period, did not venture to interrupt his meditations.

“Why do you look so pale, Lucy?” said her father, turning suddenly round
and breaking silence.

According to the ideas of the time, which did not permit a young woman
to offer her sentiments on any subject of importance unless required to
do so, Lucy was bound to appear ignorant of the meaning of all that
had passed betwixt Alice and her father, and imputed the emotion he had
observed to the fear of the wild cattle which grazed in that part of the
extensive chase through which they were now walking.

Of these animals, the descendants of the savage herds which anciently
roamed free in the Caledonian forests, it was formerly a point of
state to preserve a few in the parks of the Scottish nobility. Specimens
continued within the memory of man to be kept at least at three houses
of distinction--Hamilton, namely, Drumlanrig, and Cumbernauld. They had
degenerated from the ancient race in size and strength, if we are to
judge from the accounts of old chronicles, and from the formidable
remains frequently discovered in bogs and morasses when drained and laid
open. The bull had lost the shaggy honours of his mane, and the race was
small and light made, in colour a dingy white, or rather a pale yellow,
with black horns and hoofs. They retained, however, in some measure,
the ferocity of their ancestry, could not be domesticated on account
of their antipathy to the human race, and were often dangerous if
approached unguardedly, or wantonly disturbed. It was this last reason
which has occasioned their being extirpated at the places we have
mentioned, where probably they would otherwise have been retained as
appropriate inhabitants of a Scottish woodland, and fit tenants for
a baronial forest. A few, if I mistake not, are still preserved
at Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, the seat of the Earl of
Tankerville.

It was to her finding herself in the vicinity of a group of three or
four of these animals, that Lucy thought proper to impute those signs of
fear which had arisen in her countenance for a different reason. For she
had been familiarised with the appearance of the wil cattle during her
walks in the chase; and it was not then, as it may be now, a necessary
part of a young lady’s demeanour to indulge in causeless tremors of the
nerves. On the present occasion, however, she speedily found cause for
real terror.

Lucy had scarcely replied to her father in the words we have mentioned,
and he was just about to rebuke her supposed timidity, when a bull,
stimulated either by the scarlet colour of Miss Ashton’s mantle, or by
one of those fits of capricious ferocity to which their dispositions are
liable, detached himself suddenly from the group which was feeding at
the upper extremity of a grassy glade, that seemed to lose itself among
the crossing and entangled boughs. The animal approached the intruders
on his pasture ground, at first slowly, pawing the ground with his hoof,
bellowing from time to time, and tearing up the sand with his horns, as
if to lash himself up to rage and violence.

The Lord Keeper, who observed the animal’s demeanour, was aware that he
was about to become mischievous, and, drawing his daughter’s arm under
his own, began to walk fast along the avenue, in hopes to get out of his
sight and his reach. This was the most injudicious course he could have
adopted, for, encouraged by the appearance of flight, the bull began
to pursue them at full speed. Assailed by a danger so imminent, firmer
courage than that of the Lord Keeper might have given way. But paternal
tenderness, “love strong as death,” sustained him. He continued to
support and drag onward his daughter, until her fears altogether
depriving her of the power of flight, she sunk down by his side; and
when he could no longer assist her to escape, he turned round and placed
himself betwixt her and the raging animal, which, advancing in full
career, its brutal fury enhanced by the rapidity of the pursuit, was now
within a few yards of them. The Lord Keeper had no weapons; his age
and gravity dispensed even with the usual appendage of a walking
sword--could such appendage have availed him anything.

It seemed inevitable that the father or daughter, or both, should
have fallen victims to the impending danger, when a shot from the
neighbouring thicket arrested the progress of the animal. He was so
truly struck between the junction of the spine with the skull, that the
wound, which in any other part of his body might scarce have impeded his
career, proved instantly fatal. Stumbling forward with a hideous bellow,
the progressive force of his previous motion, rather than any operation
of his limbs, carried him up to within three yards of the astonished
Lord Keeper, where he rolled on the ground, his limbs darkened with the
black death-sweat, and quivering with the last convulsions of muscular
motion.

Lucy lay senseless on the ground, insensible of the wonderful
deliverance which she had experience. Her father was almost equally
stupified, so rapid and unexpected had been the transition from the
horrid death which seemed inevitable to perfect security. He gazed on
the animal, terrible even in death, with a species of mute and confused
astonishment, which did not permit him distinctly to understand what had
taken place; and so inaccurate was his consciousness of what had passed,
that he might have supposed the bull had been arrested in its career by
a thunderbolt, had he not observed among the branches of the thicket the
figure of a man, with a short gun or musquetoon in his hand.

This instantly recalled him to a sense of their situation: a glance at
his daughter reminded him of the necessity of procuring her assistance.
He called to the man, whom he concluded to be one of his foresters, to
give immediate attention to Miss Ashton, while he himself hastened to
call assistance. The huntsman approached them accordingly, and the Lord
Keeper saw he was a stranger, but was too much agitated to make any
farther remarks. In a few hurried words he directed the shooter, as
stronger and more active than himself, to carry the young lady to a
neighbouring fountain, while he went back to Alice’s hut to procure more
aid.

The man to whose timely interference they had been so much indebted did
not seem inclined to leave his good work half finished. He raised Lucy
from the ground in his arms, and conveying her through the glades of
the forest by paths with which he seemed well acquainted, stopped not
until he laid her in safety by the side of a plentiful and pellucid
fountain, which had been once covered in, screened and decorated with
architectural ornaments of a Gothic character. But now the vault which
had covered it being broken down and riven, and the Gothic font ruined
and demolished, the stream burst forth from the recess of the earth in
open day, and winded its way among the broken sculpture and moss-grown
stones which lay in confusion around its source.

Tradition, always busy, at least in Scotland, to grace with a legendary
tale a spot in itself interesting, had ascribed a cause of peculiar
veneration to this fountain. A beautiful young lady met one of the Lords
of Ravenswood while hunting near this spot, and, like a second Egeria,
had captivated the affections of the feudal Numa. They met frequently
afterwards, and always at sunset, the charms of the nymph’s mind
completing the conquest which her beauty had begun, and the mystery of
the intrigue adding zest to both. She always appeared and disappeared
close by the fountain, with which, therefore, her lover judged she had
some inexplicable connexion. She placed certain restrictions on their
intercourse, which also savoured of mystery. They met only once a
week--Friday was the appointed day--and she explained to the Lord of
Ravenswood that they were under the necessity of separating so soon as
the bell of a chapel, belonging to a hermitage in the adjoining wood,
now long ruinous, should toll the hour of vespers. In the course of his
confession, the Baron of Ravenswood entrusted the hermit with the
secret of this singular amour, and Father Zachary drew the necessary and
obvious consequence that his patron was enveloped in the toils of Satan,
and in danger of destruction, both to body and soul. He urged these
perils to the Baron with all the force of monkish rhetoric, and
described, in the most frightful colours, the real character and person
of the apparently lovely Naiad, whom he hesitated not to denounce as
a limb of the kingdom of darkness. The lover listened with obstinate
incredulity; and it was not until worn out by the obstinacy of the
anchoret that he consented to put the state and condition of his
mistress to a certain trial, and for that purpose acquiesced in
Zachary’s proposal that on their next interview the vespers bell
should be rung half an hour later than usual. The hermit maintained
and bucklered his opinion, by quotations from Malleus Malificarum,
Sprengerus, Remigius, and other learned demonologists, that the Evil
One, thus seduced to remain behind the appointed hour, would assume her
true shape, and, having appeared to her terrified lover as a fiend of
hell, would vanish from him in a flash of sulphurous lightning. Raymond
of Ravenswood acquiesced in the experiment, not incurious concerning
the issue, though confident it would disappoint the expectations of the
hermit.

At the appointed hour the lovers met, and their interview was protracted
beyond that at which they usually parted, by the delay of the priest
to ring his usual curfew. No change took place upon the nymph’s outward
form; but as soon as the lengthening shadows made her aware that the
usual hour of the vespers chime was passed, she tore herself from her
lover’s arms with a shriek of despair, bid him adieu for ever, and,
plunging into the fountain, disappeared from his eyes. The bubbles
occasioned by her descent were crimsoned with blood as they arose,
leading the distracted Baron to infer that his ill-judged curiosity
had occasioned the death of this interesting and mysterious being. The
remorse which he felt, as well as the recollection of her charms, proved
the penance of his future life, which he lost in the battle of Flodden
not many months after. But, in memory of his Naiad, he had previously
ornamented the fountain in which she appeared to reside, and secured its
waters from profanation or pollution by the small vaulted building of
which the fragments still remained scattered around it. From this period
the house of Ravenswood was supposed to have dated its decay.

Such was the generally-received legend, which some, who would seem
wiser than the vulgar, explained as obscurely intimating the fate of a
beautiful maid of plebeian rank, the mistress of this Raymond, whom he
slew in a fit of jealousy, and whose blood was mingled with the waters
of the locked fountain, as it was commonly called. Others imagined
that the tale had a more remote origin in the ancient heathen mythology.
All, however, agreed that the spot was fatal to the Ravenswood family;
and that to drink of the waters of the well, or even approach its brink,
was as ominous to a descendant of that house as for a Grahame to wear
green, a Bruce to kill a spider, or a St. Clair to cross the Ord on a
Monday.

It was on this ominous spot that Lucy Ashton first drew breath after her
long and almost deadly swoon. Beautiful and pale as the fabulous Naiad
in the last agony of separation from her lover, she was seated so as to
rest with her back against a part of the ruined wall, while her mantle,
dripping with the water which her protector had used profusely to recall
her senses, clung to her slender and beautifully proportioned form.

The first moment of recollection brought to her mind the danger which
had overpowered her senses; the next called to remembrance that of her
father. She looked around; he was nowhere to be seen. “My father, my
father!” was all that she could ejaculate.

“Sir William is safe,” answered the voice of a stranger--“perfectly
safe, adn will be with you instantly.”

“Are you sure of that?” exclaimed Lucy. “The bull was close by us. Do
not stop me: I must go to seek my father!”

And she rose with that purpose; but her strength was so much exhausted
that, far from possessing the power to execute her purpose, she must
have fallen against the stone on which she had leant, probably not
without sustaining serious injury.

The stranger was so near to her that, without actually suffering her to
fall, he could not avoid catching her in his arms, which, however, he
did with a momentary reluctance, very unusual when youth interposes to
prevent beauty from danger. It seemed as if her weight, slight as it
was, proved too heavy for her young and athletic assistant, for, without
feeling the temptation of detaining her in his arms even for a single
instant, he again placed her on the stone from which she had risen,
and retreating a few steps, repeated hastily “Sir William Ashton is
perfectly safe and will be here instantly. Do not make yourself anxious
on his account: Fate has singularly preserved him. You, madam, are
exhausted, and must not think of rising until you have some assistance
more suitable than mine.”

Lucy, whose senses were by this time more effectually collected, was
naturally led to look at the stranger with attention. There was nothing
in his appearance which should have rendered him unwilling to offer his
arm to a young lady who required support, or which could have induced
her to refuse his assistance; and she could not help thinking, even
in that moment, that he seemed cold and reluctant to offer it. A
shooting-dress of dark cloth intimated the rank of the wearer, though
concealed in part by a large and loose cloak of a dark brown colour.
A montero cap and a black feather drooped over the wearer’s brow,
and partly concealed his features, which, so far as seen, were dark,
regular, adn full of majestic, though somewhat sullen, expression.
Some secret sorrow, or the brooding spirit of some moody passion, had
quenched the light and ingenuous vivacity of youth in a countenance
singularly fitted to display both, and it was not easy to gaze on the
stranger without a secret impression either of pity or awe, or at least
of doubt and curiosity allied to both.

The impression which we have necessarily been long in describing, Lucy
felt in the glance of a moment, and had no sooner encountered the keen
black eyes of the stranger than her own were bent on the ground with a
mixture of bashful embarrassment and fear. Yet there was a necessity to
speak, or at last she thought so, and in a fluttered accent she began
to mention her wonderful escape, in which she was sure that the stranger
must, under Heaven, have been her father’s protector and her own.

He seemed to shrink from her expressions of gratitude, while he replied
abruptly, “I leave you, madam,” the deep melody of his voice rendered
powerful, but not harsh, by something like a severity of tone--“I leave
you to the protection of those to whom it is possible you may have this
day been a guardian angel.”

Lucy was surprised at the ambiguity of his language, and, with a feeling
of artless and unaffected gratitude, began to deprecate the idea of
having intended to give her deliverer any offence, as if such a thing
had been possible. “I have been unfortunate,” she said, “in endeavouring
to express my thanks--I am sure it must be so, though I cannot recollect
what I said; but would you but stay till my father--till the Lord Keeper
comes; would you only permit him to pay you his thanks, and to inquire
your name?”

“My name is unnecessary,” answered the stranger; “your father--I would
rather say Sir William Ashton--will learn it soon enough, for all the
pleasure it is likely to afford him.”

“You mistake him,” said Lucy, earnestly; “he will be grateful for my
sake and for his own. You do not know my father, or you are deceiving me
with a story of his safety, when he has already fallen a victim to the
fury of that animal.”

When she had caught this idea, she started from the ground and
endeavoured to press towards the avenue in which the accident had taken
place, while the stranger, though he seemed to hesitate between the
desire to assist and the wish to leave her, was obliged, in common
humanity, to oppose her both by entreaty and action.

“On the word of a gentleman, madam, I tell you the truth; your father
is in perfect safety; you will expose yourself to injury if you venture
back where the herd of wild cattle grazed. If you will go”--for, having
once adopted the idea that her father was still in danger, she pressed
forward in spite of him--“if you WILL go, accept my arm, though I am not
perhaps the person who can with most propriety offer you support.”

But, without heeding this intimation, Lucy took him at his word. “Oh,
if you be a man,” she said--“if you be a gentleman, assist me to find my
father! You shall not leave me--you must go with me; he is dying perhaps
while we are talking here!”

Then, without listening to excuse or apology, and holding fast by the
stranger’s arm, though unconscious of anything save the support which
it gave, and without which she could not have moved, mixed with a vague
feeling of preventing his escape from her, she was urging, and almost
dragging, him forward when Sir William Ashton came up, followed by the
female attendant of blind Alice, and by two woodcutters, whom he had
summoned from their occupation to his assistance. His joy at seeing his
daughter safe overcame the surprise with which he would at another time
have beheld her hanging as familiarly on the arm of a stranger as she
might have done upon his own.

“Lucy, my dear Lucy, are you safe?--are you well?” were the only words
that broke from him as he embraced her in ecstasy.

“I am well, sir, thank God! and still more that I see you so; but this
gentleman,” she said, quitting his arm and shrinking from him, “what
must he think of me?” and her eloquent blood, flushing over neck and
brow, spoke how much she was ashamed of the freedom with which she had
craved, and even compelled, his assistance.

“This gentleman,” said Sir William Ashton, “will, I trust, not regret
the trouble we have given him, when I assure him of the gratitude of
the Lord Keeper for the greatest service which one man ever rendered to
another--for the life of my child--for my own life, which he has saved
by his bravery and presence of mind. He will, I am sure, permit us to
request----” “Request nothing of ME, my lord,” said the stranger, in a
stern and peremptory tone; “I am the Master of Ravenswood.”

There was a dead pause of surprise, not unmixed with less pleasant
feelings. The Master wrapt himself in his cloak, made a haughty
inclination toward Lucy, muttering a few words of courtesy, as
indistinctly heard as they seemed to be reluctantly uttered, and,
turning from them, was immediately lost in the thicket.

“The Master of Ravenswood!” said the Lord Keeper, when he had recovered
his momentary astonishment. “Hasten after him--stop him--beg him to
speak to me for a single moment.”

The two foresters accordingly set off in pursuit of the stranger. They
speedily reappeared, and, in an embarrassed and awkward manner, said the
gentleman would not return.

The Lord Keeper took one of the fellows aside, and questioned him more
closely what the Master of Ravenswood had said.

“He just said he wadna come back,” said the man, with the caution of
a prudent Scotchman, who cared not to be the bearer of an unpleasant
errand.

“He said something more, sir,” said the Lord Keeper, “and I insist on
knowing what it was.”

“Why, then, my lord,” said the man, looking down, “he said--But it wad
be nae pleasure to your lordship to hear it, for I dare say the Master
meant nae ill.”

“That’s none of your concern, sir; I desire to hear the very words.”

“Weel, then,” replied the man, “he said, ‘Tell Sir William Ashton that
the next time he and I forgather, he will nto be half sae blythe of our
meeting as of our parting.’”

“Very well, sir,” said the Lord Keeper, “I believe he alludes to a wager
we have on our hawks; it is a matter of no consequence.”

He turned to his daughter, who was by this time so much recovered as to
be able to walk home. But the effect, which the various recollections
connected with a scene so terrific made upon a mind which was
susceptible in an extreme degree, was more permanent than the injury
which her nerves had sustained. Visions of terror, both in sleep and in
waking reveries, recalled to her the form of the furious animal, and the
dreadful bellow with which he accompanied his career; and it was always
the image of the Master of Ravenswood, with his native nobleness of
countenance and form, that seemed to interpose betwixt her and assured
death. It is, perhaps, at all times dangerous for a young person to
suffer recollection to dwell repeatedly, and with too much complacency,
on the same individual; but in Lucy’s situation it was almost
unavoidable. She had never happened to see a young man of mien and
features so romantic and so striking as young Ravenswood; but had she
seen an hundred his equals or his superiors in those particulars, no one
else would have been linked to her heart by the strong associations of
remembered danger and escape, of gratitude, wonder, and curiosity. I
say curiosity, for it is likely that the singularly restrained and
unaccommodating manners of the Master of Ravenswood, so much at variance
with the natural expression of his features and grace of his deportment,
as they excited wonder by the contrast, had their effect in riveting her
attention to the recollections. She knew little of Ravenswood, or the
disputes which had existed betwixt her father and his, and perhaps could
in her gentleness of mind hardly have comprehended the angry and bitter
passions which they had engendered. But she knew that he was come of
noble stem; was poor, though descended from the noble and the wealthy;
and she felt that she could sympathise with the feelings of a proud
mind, which urged him to recoil from the proffered gratitude of the new
proprietors of his father’s house and domains. Would he have equally
shunned their acknowledgments and avoided their intimacy, had her
father’s request been urged more mildly, less abruptly, and softened
with the grace which women so well know how to throw into their manner,
when they mean to mediate betwixt the headlong passions of the ruder
sex? This was a perilous question to ask her own mind--perilous both in
the idea and its consequences.

Lucy Ashton, in short, was involved in those mazes of the imagination
which are most dangerous to the young and the sensitive. Time, it
is true, absence, change of scene and new faces, might probably have
destroyed the illusion in her instance, as it has done in many others;
but her residence remained solitary, and her mind without those means of
dissipating her pleasing visions. This solitude was chiefly owing to the
absence of Lady Ashton, who was at this time in Edinburgh, watching the
progress of some state-intrigue; the Lord Keeper only received society
out of policy or ostentation, and was by nature rather reserved and
unsociable; and thus no cavalier appeared to rival or to obscure the
ideal picture of chivalrous excellence which Lucy had pictured to
herself in the Master of Ravenswood.

While Lucy indulged in these dreams, she made frequent visits to old
blind Alice, hoping it would be easy to lead her to talk on the subject
which at present she had so imprudently admitted to occupy so large a
portion of her thoughts. But Alice did not in this particular gratify
her wishes and expectations. She spoke readily, and with pathetic
feeling, concerning the family in general, but seemed to observe
an especial and cautious silence on the subject of the present
representative. The little she said of him was not altogether so
favourable as Lucy had anticipated. She hinted that he was of a stern
and unforgiving character, more ready to resent than to pardon injuries;
and Lucy combined, with great alarm, the hints which she now dropped
of these dangerous qualities with Alice’s advice to her father, so
emphatically given, “to beware of Ravenswood.”

But that very Ravenswood, of whom such unjust suspicions had been
entertained, had, almost immediately after they had been uttered,
confuted them by saving at once her father’s life and her own. Had he
nourished such black revenge as Alice’s dark hints seemed to indicate,
no deed of active guilt was necessary to the full gratification of
that evil passion. He needed but to have withheld for an instant his
indispensable and effective assistance, and the object of his resentment
must have perished, without any direct aggression on his part, by a
death equally fearful and certain. She conceived, therefore, that some
secret prejudice, or the suspicions incident to age and misfortune,
had led Alice to form conclusions injurious to the character, and
irreconcilable both with the generous conduct and noble features, of the
Master of Ravenswood. And in this belief Lucy reposed her hope, and went
on weaving her enchanted web of fairy tissue, as beautiful and transient
as the film of the gossamer when it is pearled with the morning dew and
glimmering to the sun.

Her father, in the mean while, as well as the Master of Ravenswood, were
making reflections, as frequent though more solid than those of Lucy,
upon the singular event which had taken place. The Lord Keeper’s first
task, when he returned home, was to ascertain by medical advice that
his daughter had sustained no injury from the dangerous and alarming
situation in which she had been placed. Satisfied on this topic, he
proceeded to revise the memoranda which he had taken down from the mouth
of the person employed to interrupt the funeral service of the late
Lord Ravenswood. Bred to casuistry, and well accustomed to practise the
ambidexter ingenuity of the bar, it cost him little trouble to soften
the features of the tumult which he had been at first so anxious to
exaggerate. He preached to his colleagues of the privy council the
necessity of using conciliatory measures with young men, whose blood
and temper were hot, and their experience of life limited. He did not
hesitate to attribute some censure to the conduct of the officer, as
having been unnecessarily irritating.

These were the contents of his public despatches. The letters which
he wrote to those private friends into whose management the matter was
likely to fall were of a yet more favourable tenor. He represented
that lenity in this case would be equally politic and popular, whereas,
considering the high respect with which the rites of interment are
regarded in Scotland, any severity exercised against the Master of
Ravenswood for protecting those of his father from interruption, would
be on all sides most unfavourably construed. And, finally, assuming the
language of a generous and high-spirited man, he made it his particular
request that this affair should be passed over without severe notice. He
alluded with delicacy to the predicament in which he himself stood with
young Ravenswood, as having succeeded in the long train of litigation
by which the fortunes of that noble house had been so much reduced, and
confessed it would be most peculiarly acceptable to his own feelings,
could he find in some sort to counterbalance the disadvantages which he
had occasioned the family, though only in the prosecution of his just
and lawful rights. He therefore made it his particular and personal
request that the matter should have no farther consequences, an
insinuated a desire that he himself should have the merit of having
put a stop to it by his favourable report and intercession. It was
particularly remarkable that, contrary to his uniform practice, he made
no special communication to Lady Ashton upon the subject of the tumult;
and although he mentioned the alarm which Lucy had received from one
of the wild cattle, yet he gave no detailed account of an incident so
interesting and terrible.

There was much surprise among Sir William Ashton’s political friends and
colleagues on receiving letters of a tenor so unexpected. On comparing
notes together, one smiled, one put up his eyebrows, a third nodded
acquiescence in the general wonder, and a fourth asked if they were sure
these were ALL the letters the Lord Keeper had written on the subject.
“It runs strangely in my mind, my lords, that none of these advices
contain the root of the matter.”

But no secret letters of a contrary nature had been received, although
the question seemed to imply the possibility of their existence.

“Well,” said an old grey-headed statesman, who had contrived, by
shifting and trimming, to maintain his post at the steerage through all
the changes of course which the vessel had held for thirty years, “I
thought Sir William would hae verified the auld Scottish saying, ‘As
soon comes the lamb’s skin to market as the auld tup’s’.”

“We must please him after his own fashion,” said another, “though it be
an unlooked-for one.”

“A wilful man maun hae his way,” answered the old counsellor.

“The Keeper will rue this before year and day are out,” said a third;
“the Master of Ravenswood is the lad to wind him a pirn.”

“Why, what would you do, my lords, with the poor young fellow?” said a
noble Marquis present. “The Lord Keeper has got all his estates; he has
not a cross to bless himself with.”

On which the ancient Lord Turntippet replied,

     “If he hasna gear to fine,
     He ha shins to pine.

“And that was our way before the Revolution: Lucitur cum persona, qui
luere non potest cum crumena. Hegh, my lords, that’s gude law Latin.”

“I can see no motive,” replied the Marquis, “that any noble lord can
have for urging this matter farther; let the Lord Keeper have the power
to deal in it as he pleases.”

“Agree, agree--remit to the Lord Keeper, with any other person for
fashion’s sake--Lord Hirplehooly, who is bed-ridden--one to be a quorum.
Make your entry in the minutes, Mr. Clerk. And now, my lords, there is
that young scattergood the Laird of Bucklaw’s fine to be disposed upon.
I suppose it goes to my Lord Treasurer?”

“Shame be in my meal-poke, then,” exclaimed the Lord Turntippet, “and
your hand aye in the nook of it! I had set that down for a bye-bit
between meals for mysell.”

“To use one of your favourite saws, my lord,” replied the Marquis, “you
are like the miller’s dog, that licks his lips before the bag is untied:
the man is not fined yet.”

“But that costs but twa skarts of a pen,” said Lord Turntippet; “and
surely there is nae noble lord that will presume to say that I, wha hae
complied wi’ a’ compliances, taen all manner of tests, adjured all that
was to be abjured, and sworn a’ that was to be sworn, for these thirty
years bye-past, sticking fast by my duty to the state through good
report and bad report, shouldna hae something now and then to synd my
mouth wi’ after sic drouthy wark? Eh?”

“It would be very unreasonable indeed, my lord,” replied the Marquis,
“had we either thought that your lordship’s drought was quenchable, or
observed anything stick in your throat that required washing down.”

And so we close the scene on the privy council of that period.




CHAPTER VI.

     For this are all these warriors come,
     To hear an idle tale;
     And o’er our death-accustom’d arms
     Shall silly tears prevail?

     HENRY MACKENZIE.

ON the evening of the day when the Lord Keeper and his daughter were
saved from such imminent peril, two strangers were seated in the most
private apartment of a small obscure inn, or rather alehouse, called
the Tod’s Den [Hole], about three or four [five or six] miles from the
Castle of Ravenswood and as far from the ruinous tower of Wolf’s Crag,
betwixt which two places it was situated.

One of these strangers was about forty years of age, tall, and thin in
the flanks, with an aquiline nose, dark penetrating eyes, and a shrewd
but sinister cast of countenance. The other was about fifteen years
younger, short, stout, ruddy-faced, and red-haired, with an open,
resolute, and cheerful eye, to which careless and fearless freedom and
inward daring gave fire and expression, notwithstanding its light grey
colour. A stoup of wine (for in those days it was served out from the
cask in pewter flagons) was placed on the table, and each had his quaigh
or bicker before him. But there was little appearance of conviviality.
With folded arms, and looks of anxious expectation, they eyed each other
in silence, each wrapt in his own thoughts, and holding no communication
with his neighbour. At length the younger broke silence by exclaiming:
“What the foul fiend can detain the Master so long? He must have
miscarried in his enterprise. Why did you dissuade me from going with
him?”

“One man is enough to right his own wrong,” said the taller and older
personage; “we venture our lives for him in coming thus far on such an
errand.”

“You are but a craven after all, Craigengelt,” answered the younger,
“and that’s what many folk have thought you before now.” “But what none
has dared to tell me,” said Craigengelt, laying his hand on the hilt of
his sword; “and, but that I hold a hasty man no better than a fool, I
would----” he paused for his companion’s answer.

“WOULD you?” said the other, coolly; “and why do you not then?”

Craigengelt drew his cutlass an inch or two, and then returned it with
violence into the scabbard--“Because there is a deeper stake to be
played for than the lives of twenty hare-brained gowks like you.”

“You are right there,” said his companion, “for it if were not that
these forfeitures, and that last fine that the old driveller Turntippet
is gaping for, and which, I dare say, is laid on by this time, have
fairly driven me out of house and home, I were a coxcomb and a cuckoo to
boot to trust your fair promises of getting me a commission in the
Irish brigade. What have I to do with the Irish brigade? I am a
plain Scotchman, as my father was before me; and my grand-aunt, Lady
Girnington, cannot live for ever.”

“Ay, Bucklaw,” observed Craigengelt, “but she may live for many a long
day; and for your father, he had land and living, kept himself close
from wadsetters and money-lenders, paid each man his due, and lived on
his own.”

“And whose fault is it that I have not done so too?” said
Bucklaw--“whose but the devil’s and yours, and such-like as you, that
have led me to the far end of a fair estate? And now I shall be obliged,
I suppose, to shelter and shift about like yourself: live one week upon
a line of secret intelligence from Saint Germains; another upon a report
of a rising in the Highlands; get my breakfast and morning draught of
sack from old Jacobite ladies, and give them locks of my old wig for the
Chevalier’s hair; second my friend in his quarrel till he comes to the
field, and then flinch from him lest so important a political agent
should perish from the way. All this I must do for bread, besides
calling myself a captain!”

“You think you are making a fine speech now,” said Craigengelt, “and
showing much wit at my expense. Is starving or hanging better than the
life I am obliged to lead, because the present fortunes of the king
cannot sufficiently support his envoys?” “Starving is honester,
Craigengelt, and hanging is like to be the end on’t. But what you mean
to make of this poor fellow Ravenswood, I know not. He has no money
left, any more than I; his lands are all pawned and pledged, and the
interest eats up the rents, and is not satisfied, and what do you hope
to make by meddling in his affairs?”

“Content yourself, Bucklaw; I know my business,” replied Craigengelt.
“Besides that his name, and his father’s services in 1689, will make
such an acquisition sound well both at Versailles and Saint Germains,
you will also please be informed that the Master of Ravenswood is a very
different kind of a young fellow from you. He has parts and address,
as well as courage and talents, and will present himself abroad like a
young man of head as well as heart, who knows something more than the
speed of a horse or the flight of a hawk. I have lost credit of late, by
bringing over no one that had sense to know more than how to unharbour a
stag, or take and reclaim an eyas. The Master has education, sense, and
penetration.”

“And yet is not wise enough to escape the tricks of a kidnapper,
Craigengelt?” replied the younger man. “But don’t be angry; you know
you will nto fight, and so it is as well to leave your hilt in peace
and quiet, and tell me in sober guise how you drew the Master into your
confidence?”

“By flattering his love of vengeance, Bucklaw,” answered Craigengelt.
“He has always distrusted me; but I watched my time, and struck while
his temper was red-hot with the sense of insult and of wrong. He goes
now to expostulate, as he says, and perhaps thinks, with Sir William
Ashton. I say, that if they meet, and the lawyer puts him to his
defence, the Master will kill him; for he had that sparkle in his eye
which never deceives you when you would read a man’s purpose. At any
rate, he will give him such a bullying as will be construed into an
assault on a privy councillor; so there will be a total breach betwixt
him and government. Scotland will be too hot for him; France will gain
him; and we will all set sail together in the French brig ‘L’Espoir,’
which is hovering for us off Eyemouth.”

“Content am I,” said Bucklaw; “Scotland has little left that I care
about; and if carrying the Master with us will get us a better reception
in France, why, so be it, a God’s name. I doubt our own merits will
procure us slender preferment; and I trust he will send a ball through
the Keeper’s head before he joins us. One or two of these scoundrel
statesmen should be shot once a year, just to keep the others on their
good behaviour.”

“That is very true,” replied Craigengelt; “and it reminds me that I
must go and see that our horses have been fed and are in readiness; for,
should such deed be done, it will be no time for grass to grow beneath
their heels.” He proceeded as far as the door, then turned back with a
look of earnestness, and said to Bucklaw: “Whatever should come of this
business, I am sure you will do me the justice to remember that I said
nothing to the Master which could imply my accession to any act of
violence which he may take it into his head to commit.”

“No, no, not a single word like accession,” replied Bucklaw; “you
know too well the risk belonging to these two terrible words, ‘art and
part.’” Then, as if to himself, he recited the following lines:

“The dial spoke not, but it made shrewd signs, And pointed full upon the
stroke of murder.

“What is that you are talking to yourself?” said Craigengelt, turning
back with some anxiety.

“Nothing, only two lines I have heard upon the stage,” replied his
companion.

“Bucklaw,” said Craigengelt, “I sometimes think you should have been a
stage-player yourself; all is fancy and frolic with you.”

“I have often thought so myself,” said Bucklaw. “I believe it would be
safer than acting with you in the Fatal Conspiracy. But away, play
your own part, and look after the horses like a groom as you are. A
play-actor--a stage-player!” he repeated to himself; “that would have
deserved a stab, but that Craigengelt’s a coward. And yet I should like
the profession well enough. Stay, let me see; ay, I would come out in
Alexander:

     Thus from the grave I rise to save my love,
     Draw all your swords, and quick as lightning move.
     When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay:
     ‘Tis love commands, and glory leads the way.”

As with a voice of thunder, and his hand upon his sword, Bucklaw
repeated the ranting couplets of poor Lee, Craigengelt re-entered with a
face of alarm.

“We are undone, Bucklaw! The Master’s led horse has cast himself over
his halter in the stable, and is dead lame. His hackney will be set up
with the day’s work, and now he has no fresh horse; he will never get
off.”

“Egad, there will be no moving with the speed of lightning this bout,”
 said Bucklaw, drily. “But stay, you can give him yours.”

“What! and be taken myself? I thank you for the proposal,” said
Craigengelt.

“Why,” replied Bucklaw, “if the Lord Keeper should have met with a
mischance, which for my part I cannot suppose, for the Master is not
the lad to shoot an old and unarmed man--but IF there should have been
a fray at the Castle, you are neither art not part in it, you know, so
have nothing to fear.”

“True, true,” answered the other, with embarrassment; “but consider my
commission from Saint Germains.”

“Which many men think is a commission of your own making, noble Captain.
Well, if you will not give him your horse, why, d----n it, he must have
mine.”

“Yours?” said Craigengelt.

“Ay, mine,” repeated Bucklaw; “it shall never be said that I agreed to
back a gentleman in a little affair of honour, and neither helped him on
with it nor off from it.”

“You will give him your horse? and have you considered the loss?”

“Loss! why, Grey Gilbert cost me twenty Jacobuses, that’s true; but then
his hackney is worth something, and his Black Moor is worth twice as
much were he sound, and I know how to handle him. Take a fat sucking
mastiff whelp, flay and bowel him, stuff the body full of black and
grey snails, roast a reasonable time, and baste with oil of spikenard,
saffron, cinnamon, and honey, anoint with the dripping, working it
in----”

“Yes, Bucklaw; but in the mean while, before the sprain is cured, nay,
before the whelp is roasted, you will be caught and hung. Depend on it,
the chase will be hard after Ravenswood. I wish we had made our place of
rendezvous nearer to the coast.”

“On my faith, then,” said Bucklaw, “I had best go off just now, and
leave my horse for him. Stay--stay, he comes: I hear a horse’s feet.”

“Are you sure there is only one?” said Craigengelt. “I fear there is a
chase; I think I hear three or four galloping together. I am sure I hear
more horses than one.”

“Pooh, pooh, it is the wench of the house clattering to the well in her
pattens. By my faith, Captain, you should give up both your captainship
and your secret service, for you are as easily scared as a wild goose.
But here comes the Master alone, and looking as gloomy as a night in
November.”

The Master of Ravenswood entered the room accordingly, his cloak muffled
around him, his arms folded, his looks stern, and at the same time
dejected. He flung his cloak from him as he entered, threw himself upon
a chair, and appeared sunk in a profound reverie.

“What has happened? What have you done?” was hastily demanded by
Craigengelt and Bucklaw in the same moment.

“Nothing!” was the short and sullen answer.

“Nothing! and left us, determined to call the old villain to account
for all the injuries that you, we, and the country have received at his
hand? Have you seen him?” “I have,” replied the Master of Ravenswood.

“Seen him--and come away without settling scores which have been so long
due?” said Bucklaw; “I would not have expected that at the hand of the
Master of Ravenswood.”

“No matter what you expected,” replied Ravenswood; “it is not to you,
sir, that I shall be disposed to render any reason for my conduct.”

“Patience, Bucklaw,” said Craigengelt, interrupting his companion, who
seemed about to make an angry reply. “The Master has been interrupted in
his purpose by some accident; but he must excuse the anxious curiosity
of friends who are devoted to his cause like you and me.”

“Friends, Captain Craigengelt!” retorted Ravenswood, haughtily; “I am
ignorant what familiarity passed betwixt us to entitle you to use that
expression. I think our friendship amounts to this, that we agreed to
leave Scotland together so soon as I should have visited the
alienated mansion of my fathers, and had an interview with its present
possessor--I will not call him proprietor.”

“Very true, Master,” answered Bucklaw; “and as we thought you had in
mind to do something to put your neck in jeopardy, Craigie and I very
courteously agreed to tarry for you, although ours might run some risk
in consequence. As to Craigie, indeed, it does not very much signify: he
had gallows written on his brow in the hour of his birth; but I should
not like to discredit my parentage by coming to such an end in another
man’s cause.”

“Gentlemen,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “I am sorry if I have
occasioned you any inconvenience, but I must claim the right of judging
what is best for my own affairs, without rendering explanations to any
one. I have altered my mind, and do not design to leave the country this
season.”

“Not to leave the country, Master!” exclaimed Craigengelt. “Not to go
over, after all the trouble and expense I have incurred--after all the
risk of discovery, and the expense of freight and demurrage!”

“Sir,” replied the Master of Ravenswood, “when I designed to leave this
country in this haste, I made use of your obliging offer to procure me
means of conveyance; but I do not recollect that I pledged myself to
go off, if I found occasion to alter my mind. For your trouble on my
account, I am sorry, and I thank you; your expense,” he added, putting
his hand into his pocket, “admits a more solid compensation: freight and
demurrage are matters with which I am unacquainted, Captain Craigengelt,
but take my purse and pay yourself according to your own conscience.”
 And accordingly he tendered a purse with some gold in it to the
soi-disant captain.

But here Bucklaw interposed in his turn. “Your fingers, Craigie, seem to
itch for that same piece of green network,” said he; “but I make my vow
to God, that if they offer to close upon it, I will chop them off with
my whinger. Since the Master has changed his mind, I suppose we need
stay here no longer; but in the first place I beg leave to tell him----”

“Tell him anything you will,” said Craigengelt, “if you will first
allow me to state the inconveniences to which he will expose himself by
quitting our society, to remind him of the obstacles to his remaining
here, and of the difficulties attending his proper introduction at
Versailles and Saint Germains without the countenance of those who have
established useful connexions.”

“Besides forfeiting the friendship,” said Bucklaw, “of at least one man
of spirit and honour.”

“Gentlemen,” said Ravenswood, “permit me once more to assure you
that you have been pleased to attach to our temporary connexion more
importance than I ever meant that it should have. When I repair to
foreign courts, I shall not need the introduction of an intriguing
adventurer, nor is it necessary for me to set value on the friendship
of a hot-headed bully.” With these words, and without waiting for an
answer, he left the apartment, remounted his horse, and was heard to
ride off.

“Mortbleu!” said Captain Craigengelt, “my recruit is lost!”

“Ay, Captain,” said Bucklaw, “the salmon is off with hook and all. But
I will after him, for I have had more of his insolence than I can well
digest.”

Craigengelt offered to accompany him; but Bucklaw replied: “No, no,
Captain, keep you the check of the chimney-nook till I come back; it’s
good sleeping in a haill skin.

     Little kens the auld wife that sits by the fire,
     How cauld the wind blaws in hurle-burle swire.”

And singing as he went, he left the apartment.




CHAPTER VII.

     Now, Billy Berwick, keep good heart,
     And of they talking let me be;
     But if thou art a man, as I am sure thou art,
     Come over the dike and fight with me.

     Old Ballad.

THE Master of Ravenswood had mounted the ambling hackney which he before
rode, on finding the accident which had happened to his led horse, and,
for the animal’s ease, was proceeding at a slow pace from the Tod’s Den
towards his old tower of Wolf’s Crag, when he heard the galloping of a
horse behind him, and, looking back, perceived that he was pursued by
young Bucklaw, who had been delayed a few minutes in the pursuit by
the irresistable temptation of giving the hostler at the Tod’s Den some
recipe for treating the lame horse. This brief delay he had made up by
hard galloping, and now overtook the Master where the road traversed
a waste moor. “Halt, sir,” cried Bucklaw; “I am no political agent--no
Captain Craigengelt, whose life is too important to be hazarded in
defence of his honour. I am Frank Hayston of Bucklaw, and no man injures
me by word, deed, sign, or look, but he must render me an account of
it.”

“This is all very well, Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” replied the Master
of Ravenswood, in a tone the most calm and indifferent; “but I have no
quarrel with you, and desire to have none. Our roads homeward, as well
as our roads through life, lie in different directions; there is no
occasion for us crossing each other.”

“Is there not?” said Bucklaw, impetuously. “By Heaven! but I say that
there is, though: you called us intriguing adventurers.”

“Be correct in your recollection, Mr. Hayston; it was to your companion
only I applied that epithet, and you know him to be no better.”

“And what then? He was my companion for the time, and no man shall
insult my companion, right or wrong, while he is in my company.”

“Then, Mr. Hayston,” replied Ravenswood, with the same composure, “you
should choose your society better, or you are like to have much work
in your capacity of their champion. Go home, sir; sleep, and have more
reason in your wrath to-morrow.”

“Not so, Master, you have mistaken your man; high airs and wise saws
shall not carry it off thus. Besides, you termed me bully, and you shall
retract the word before we part.”

“Faith, scarcely,” said Ravenswood, “unless you show me better reason
for thinking myself mistaken than you are now producing.”

“Then, Master,” said Bucklaw, “though I should be sorry to offer it to a
man of your quality, if you will not justify your incivility, or retract
it, or name a place of meeting, you must here undergo the hard word and
the hard blow.”

“Neither will be necessary,” said Ravenswood; “I am satisfied with what
I have done to avoid an affair with you. If you are serious, this place
will serve as well as another.”

“Dismount then, and draw,” said Bucklaw, setting him an example. “I
always thought and said you were a pretty man; I should be sorry to
report you otherwise.”

“You shall have no reason, sir,” said Ravenswood, alighting, and putting
himself into a posture of defence.

Their swords crossed, and the combat commenced with great spirit on the
part of Bucklaw, who was well accustomed to affairs of the kind, and
distinguished by address and dexterity at his weapon. In the present
case, however, he did not use his skill to advantage; for, having
lost temper at the cool and contemptuous manner in which the Master of
Ravenswood had long refused, and at length granted, him satisfaction,
and urged by his impatience, he adopted the part of an assailant with
inconsiderate eagerness. The Master, with equal skill, and much greater
composure, remained chiefly on the defensive, and even declined to avail
himself of one or two advantages afforded him by the eagerness of his
adversary. At length, in a desperate lunge, which he followed with
an attempt to close, Bucklaw’s foot slipped, and he fell on the short
grassy turf on which they were fighting. “Take your life, sir,” said the
Master of Ravenswood, “and mend it if you can.”

“It would be but a cobbled piece of work, I fear,” said Bucklaw, rising
slowly and gathering up his sword, much less disconcerted with the issue
of the combat than could have been expected from the impetuosity of
his temper. “I thank you for my life, Master,” he pursued. “There is my
hand; I bear no ill-will to you, either for my bad luck or your better
swordsmanship.”

The Master looked steadily at him for an instant, then extended his hand
to him. “Bucklaw,” he said, “you are a generous fellow, and I have done
you wrong. I heartily ask your pardon for the expression which offended
you; it was hastily and incautiously uttered, and I am convinced it is
totally misapplied.”

“Are you indeed, Master?” said Bucklaw, his face resuming at once its
natural expression of light-hearted carelessness and audacity; “that is
more than I expected of you; for, Master, men say you are not ready to
retract your opinion and your language.”

“Not when I have well considered them,” said the Master.

“Then you are a little wiser than I am, for I always give my friend
satisfaction first, and explanation afterwards. If one of us falls, all
accounts are settled; if not, men are never so ready for peace as after
war. But what does that bawling brat of a boy want?” said Bucklaw. “I
wish to Heaven he had come a few minutes sooner! and yet it must have
been ended some time, and perhaps this way is as well as any other.”

As he spoke, the boy he mentioned came up, cudgelling an ass, on which
he was mounted, to the top of its speed, and sending, like one of
Ossian’s heroes, his voice before him: “Gentlemen--gentlemen, save
yourselves! for the gudewife bade us tell ye there were folk in her
house had taen Captain Craigengelt, and were seeking for Bucklaw, and
that ye behoved to ride for it.” “By my faith, and that’s very true, my
man” said Bucklaw; “and there’s a silver sixpence for your news, and I
would give any man twice as much would tell me which way I should ride.”

“That will I, Bucklaw,” said Ravenswood; “ride home to Wolf’s Crag with
me. There are places in the old tower where you might lie hid, were a
thousand men to seek you.”

“But that will bring you into trouble yourself, Master; and unless you
be in the Jacobite scrape already, it is quite needless for me to drag
you in.”

“Not a whit; I have nothing to fear.”

“Then I will ride with you blythely, for, to say the truth, I do not
know the rendezvous that Craigie was to guide us to this night; and I am
sure that, if he is taken, he will tell all the truth of me, and twenty
lies of you, in order to save himself from the withie.”

They mounted and rode off in company accordingly, striking off the
ordinary road, and holding their way by wild moorish unfrequented paths,
with which the gentlemen were well acquainted from the exercise of
the chase, but through which others would have had much difficulty in
tracing their course. They rode for some time in silence, making such
haste as the condition of Ravenswood’s horse permitted, until night
having gradually closed around them, they discontinued their speed, both
from the difficulty of discovering their path, and from the hope that
they were beyond the reach of pursuit or observation.

“And now that we have drawn bridle a bit,” said Bucklaw, “I would fain
ask you a question, Master.”

“Ask and welcome,” said Ravenswood, “but forgive not answering it,
unless I think proper.”

“Well, it is simply this,” answered his late antagonist “What, in
the name of old Sathan, could make you, who stand so highly on your
reputation, think for a moment of drawing up with such a rogue as
Craigengelt, and such a scapegrace as folk call Bucklaw?”

“Simply, because I was desperate, and sought desperate associates.”

“And what made you break off from us at the nearest?” again demanded
Bucklaw.

“Because I had changed my mind,” said the Master, “and renounced my
enterprise, at least for the present. And now that I have answered your
questions fairly and frankly, tell me what makes you associate with
Craigengelt, so much beneath you both in birth and in spirit?”

“In plain terms,” answered Bucklaw, “because I am a fool, who have
gambled away my land in thse times. My grand-aunt, Lady Girnington, has
taen a new tack of life, I think, and I could only hope to get something
by a change of government. Craigie was a sort of gambling acquaintance;
he saw my condition, and, as the devil is always at one’s elbow, told
me fifty lies about his credentials from Versailles, and his interest at
Saint Germains, promised me a captain’s commission at Paris, and I have
been ass enough to put my thumb under his belt. I dare say, by this
time, he has told a dozen pretty stories of me to the government. And
this is what I have got by wine, women, and dice, cocks, dogs, and
horses.”

“Yes, Bucklaw,” said the Master, “you have indeed nourished in your
bosom the snakes that are now stinging you.”

“That’s home as well as true, Master,” replied his companion; “but, by
your leave, you have nursed in your bosom one great goodly snake
that has swallowed all the rest, and is as sure to devour you as my
half-dozen are to make a meal on all that’s left of Bucklaw, which is
but what lies between bonnet and boot-heel.”

“I must not,” answered the Master of Ravenswood, “challenge the
freedom of speech in which I have set example. What, to speak without
a metaphor, do you call this monstrous passion which you charge me with
fostering?”

“Revenge, my good sir--revenge; which, if it be as gentle manlike a sin
as wine and wassail, with their et coeteras, is equally unchristian, and
not so bloodless. It is better breaking a park-pale to watch a doe or
damsel than to shoot an old man.”

“I deny the purpose,” said the Master of Ravenswood. “On my soul, I had
no such intention; I meant but to confront the oppressor ere I left my
native land, and upbraid him with his tyranny and its consequences.
I would have stated my wrongs so that they would have shaken his soul
within him.”

“Yes,” answered Bucklaw, “and he would have collared you, and cried
‘help,’ and then you would have shaken the soul OUT of him, I suppose.
Your very look and manner would have frightened the old man to death.”

“Consider the provocation,” answered Ravenswood--“consider the ruin and
death procured and caused by his hard-hearted cruelty--an ancient house
destroyed, an affectionate father murdered! Why, in our old Scottish
days, he that sat quiet under such wrongs would have been held neither
fit to back a friend nor face a foe.”

“Well, Master, I am glad to see that the devil deals as cunningly with
other folk as he deals with me; for whenever I am about to commit any
folly, he persuades me it is the most necessary, gallant, gentlemanlike
thing on earth, and I am up to saddlegirths in the bog before I see that
the ground is soft. And you, Master, might have turned out a murd----a
homicide, just out of pure respect for your father’s memory.”

“There is more sense in your language, Bucklaw,” replied the Master,
“than might have been expected from your conduct. It is too true, our
vices steal upon us in forms outwardly as fair as those of the demons
whom the superstitious represent as intriguing with the human race, and
are not discovered in their native hideousness until we have clasped
them in our arms.”

“But we may throw them from us, though,” said Bucklaw, “and that is
what I shall think of doing one of these days--that is, when old Lady
Girnington dies.”

“Did you ever hear the expression of the English divine?” said
Ravenswood--“‘Hell is paved with good intentions,’--as much as to say,
they are more often formed than executed.”

“Well,” replied Bucklaw, “but I will begin this blessed night, and have
determined not to drink above one quart of wine, unless your claret be
of extraordinary quality.”

“You will find little to tempt you at Wolf’s Crag,” said the Master. “I
know not that I can promise you more than the shelter of my roof; all,
and more than all, our stock of wine and provisions was exhausted at the
late occasion.”

“Long may it be ere provision is needed for the like purpose,” answered
Bucklaw; “but you should not drink up the last flask at a dirge; there
is ill luck in that.”

“There is ill luck, I think, in whatever belongs to me,” said
Ravenswood. “But yonder is Wolf’s Crag, and whatever it still contains
is at your service.”

The roar of the sea had long announced their approach to the cliffs, on
the summit of which, like the nest of some sea-eagle, the founder of the
fortalice had perched his eyrie. The pale moon, which had hitherto been
contending with flitting clouds, now shone out, and gave them a view
of the solitary and naked tower, situated on a projecting cliff that
beetled on the German Ocean. On three sides the rock was precipitous;
on the fourth, which was that towards the land, it had been originally
fenced by an artificial ditch and drawbridge, but the latter was broken
down and ruinous, and the former had been in part filled up, so as to
allow passage for a horseman into the narrow courtyard, encircled on two
sides with low offices and stables, partly ruinous, and closed on the
landward front by a low embattled wall, while the remaining side of the
quadrangle was occupied by the tower itself, which, tall and narrow, and
built of a greyish stone, stood glimmering in the moonlight, like
the sheeted spectre of some huge giant. A wilder or more disconsolate
dwelling it was perhaps difficult to conceive. The sombrous and heavy
sound of the billows, successively dashing against the rocky beach at a
profound distance beneath, was to the ear what the landscape was to the
eye--a symbol of unvaried and monotonous melancholy, not unmingled with
horror.

Although the night was not far advanced, there was no sign of living
inhabitant about this forlorn abode, excepting that one, and only
one, of the narrow and stanchelled windows which appeared at irregular
heights and distances in the walls of the building showed a small
glimmer of light.

“There,” said Ravenswood, “sits the only male domestic that remains to
the house of Ravenswood; and it is well that he does remain there, since
otherwise we had little hope to find either light or fire. But follow me
cautiously; the road is narrow, and admits only one horse in front.”

In effect, the path led along a kind of isthmus, at the peninsular
extremity of which the tower was situated, with that exclusive attention
to strength and security, in preference to every circumstances of
convenience, which dictated to the Scottish barons the choice of their
situations, as well as their style of building.

By adopting the cautious mode of approach recommended by the proprietor
of this wild hold, they entered the courtyard in safety. But it was long
ere the efforts of Ravenswood, though loudly exerted by knocking at the
low-browed entrance, and repeated shouts to Caleb to open the gate and
admit them, received any answer.

“The old man must be departed,” he began to say, “or fallen into some
fit; for the noise I have made would have waked the seven sleepers.”

At length a timid and hesitating voice replied: “Master--Master of
Ravenswood, is it you?”

“Yes, it is I, Caleb; open the door quickly.”

“But it is you in very blood and body? For I would sooner face fifty
deevils as my master’s ghaist, or even his wraith; wherefore, aroint ye,
if ye were ten times my master, unless ye come in bodily shape, lith and
limb.” “It is I, you old fool,” answered Ravenswood, “in bodily shape
and alive, save that I am half dead with cold.”

The light at the upper window disappeared, and glancing from loophole to
loophole in slow succession, gave intimation that the bearer was in
the act of descending, with great deliberation, a winding staircase
occupying one of the turrets which graced the angles of the old tower.
The tardiness of his descent extracted some exclamations of impatience
from Ravenswood, and several oaths from his less patient and more
mecurial companion. Caleb again paused ere he unbolted the door, and
once more asked if they were men of mould that demanded entrance at this
time of night.

“Were I near you, you old fool,” said Bucklaw, “I would give you
sufficient proofs of MY bodily condition.”

“Open the gate, Caleb,” said his master, in a more soothing tone, partly
from his regard to the ancient and faithful seneschal, partly perhaps
because he thought that angry words would be thrown away, so long as
Caleb had a stout iron-clenched oaken door betwixt his person and the
speakers.

At length Caleb, with a trembling hand, undid the bars, opened the
heavy door, and stood before them, exhibiting his thin grey hairs, bald
forehead, and sharp high features, illuminated by a quivering lamp which
he held in one hand, while he shaded and protected its flame with the
other. The timorous, courteous glance which he threw around him, the
effect of the partial light upon his white hair and illumined features,
might have made a good painting; but our travellers were too impatient
for security against the rising storm to permit them to indulge
themselves in studying the picturesque. “Is it you, my dear master?--is
it you yourself, indeed?” exclaimed the old domestic. “I am wae ye suld
hae stude waiting at your ain gate; but wha wad hae thought o’ seeing ye
sae sune, and a strange gentleman with a--(Here he exclaimed apart, as
it were, and to some inmate of the tower, in a voice not meant to be
heard by those in the court)--Mysie--Mysie, woman! stir for dear life,
and get the fire mended; take the auld three-legged stool, or ony
thing that’s readiest that will make a lowe. I doubt we are but puirly
provided, no expecting ye this some months, when doubtless ye was
hae been received conform till your rank, as gude right is; but
natheless----”

“Natheless, Caleb,” said the Master, “we must have our horses put up,
and ourselves too, the best way we can. I hope you are not sorry to see
me sooner than you expected?”

“Sorry, my lord! I am sure ye sall aye be my lord wi’ honest folk, as
your noble ancestors hae been these three hundred years, and never asked
a Whig’s leave. Sorry to see the Lord of Ravenswood at ane o’ his ain
castles! (Then again apart to his unseen associate behind the screen)
Mysie, kill the brood-hen without thinking twice on it; let them care
that come ahint. No to say it’s our best dwelling,” he added, turning
to Bucklaw; “but just a strength for the Lord of Ravenswood to flee
until--that is, no to FLEE, but to retreat until in troublous times,
like the present, when it was ill convenient for him to live farther in
the country in ony of his better and mair principal manors; but, for its
antiquity, maist folk think that the outside of Wolf’s Crag is worthy of
a large perusal.”

“And you are determined we shall have time to make it,” said Ravenswood,
somewhat amused with the shifts the old man used to detain them without
doors until his confederate Mysie had made her preparations within.

“Oh, never mind the outside of the house, my good friend,” said Bucklaw;
“let’s see the inside, and let our horses see the stable, that’s all.”
 “Oh yes, sir--ay, sir--unquestionably, sir--my lord and ony of his
honourable companions----”

“But our horses, my friend--our horses; they will be dead-founded by
standing here in the cold after riding hard, and mine is too good to be
spoiled; therefore, once more, our horses!” exclaimed Bucklaw.

“True--ay--your horses--yes--I will call the grooms”; and sturdily did
Caleb roar till the old tower rang again: “John--William--Saunders!
The lads are gane out, or sleeping,” he observed, after pausing for an
answer, which he knew that he had no human chance of receiving. “A’
gaes wrang when the Master’s out-bye; but I’ll take care o’ your cattle
mysell.”

“I think you had better,” said Ravenswood, “otherwise I see little
chance of their being attended to at all.”

“Whisht, my lord--whisht, for God’s sake,” said Caleb, in an imploring
tone, and apart to his master; “if ye dinna regard your ain credit,
think on mine; we’ll hae hard eneugh wark to make a decent night o’t,
wi’ a’ the lees I can tell.”

“Well, well, never mind,” said his master; “go to the stable. There is
hay and corn, I trust?”

“Ou ay, plenty of hay and corn”; this was uttered boldly and aloud, and,
in a lower tone, “there was some half fous o’ aits, and some taits o’
meadow-hay, left after the burial.”

“Very well,” said Ravenswood, taking the lamp from his domestic’s
unwilling hand, “I will show the stranger upstairs myself.”

“I canna think o’ that, my lord; if ye wad but have five minutes, or ten
minutes, or, at maist, a quarter of an hour’s patience, and look at the
fine moonlight prospect of the Bass and North Berwick Law till I sort
the horses, I would marshal ye up, as reason is ye suld be marshalled,
your lordship and your honourable visitor. And I hae lockit up the
siller candlesticks, and the lamp is not fit----”

“It will do very well in the mean time,” said Ravenswood, “and you will
have no difficulty for want of light in the stable, for, if I recollect,
half the roof is off.”

“Very true, my lord,” replied the trusty adherent, and with ready wit
instantly added, “and the lazy sclater loons have never come to put it
on a’ this while, your lordship.”

“If I were disposed to jest at the calamities of my house,” said
Ravenswood, as he led the way upstairs, “poor old Caleb would furnish me
with ample means. His passion consists in representing things about our
miserable menage, not as they are, but as, in his opinion, they ought
to be; and, to say the truth, I have been often diverted with the poor
wretch’s expedients to supply what he though was essential for the credit
of the family, and his still more generous apologies for the want of
those articles for which his ingenuity could discover no substitute.
But though the tower is none of the largest, I shall have some trouble
without him to find the apartment in which there is a fire.”

As he spoke thus, he opened the door of the hall. “Here, at least,” he
said, “there is neither hearth nor harbour.”

It was indeed a scene of desolation. A large vaulted room, the beams of
which, combined like those of Westminster Hall, were rudely carved at
the extremities, remained nearly in the situation in which it had been
left after the entertainment at Allan Lord Ravenswood’s funeral.
Overturned pitchers, and black-jacks, and pewter stoups, and flagons
still cumbered the large oaken table; glasses, those more perishable
implements of conviviality, many of which had been voluntarily
sacrificed by the guests in their enthusiastic pledges to favourite
toasts, strewed the stone floor with their fragments. As for the
articles of plate, lent for the purpose by friends and kinsfolk, those
had been carefully withdrawn so soon as the ostentatious display of
festivity, equally unnecessary and strangely timed, had been made and
ended. Nothing, in short, remained that indicated wealth; all the signs
were those of recent wastefulness and present desolation. The black
cloth hangings, which, on the late mournful occasion, replaced the
tattered moth-eaten tapestries, had been partly pulled down, and,
dangling from the wall in irregular festoons, disclosed the rough
stonework of the building, unsmoothed either by plaster or the chisel.
The seats thrown down, or left in disorder, intimated the careless
confusion which had concluded the mournful revel. “This room,” said
Ravenswood, holding up the lamp--“this room, Mr. Hayston, was riotous
when it should have been sad; it is a just retribution that it should
now be sad when it ought to be cheerful.”

They left this disconsolate apartment, and went upstairs, where, after
opening one or two doors in vain, Ravenswood led the way into a little
matted ante-room, in which, to their great joy, they found a tolerably
good fire, which Mysie, by some such expedient as Caleb had suggested,
had supplied with a reasonable quantity of fuel. Glad at the heart to see
more of comfort than the castle had yet seemed to offer, Bucklaw rubbed
his hands heartily over the fire, and now listened with more complacency
to the apologies which the Master of Ravenswood offered. “Comfort,” he
said, “I cannot provide for you, for I have it not for myself; it
is long since these walls have known it, if, indeed, they were ever
acquainted with it. Shelter and safety, I think, I can promise you.”

“Excellent matters, Master,” replied Bucklaw, “and, with a mouthful of
food and wine, positively all I can require to-night.”

“I fear,” said the Master, “your supper will be a poor one; I hear
the matter in discussion betwixt Caleb and Mysie. Poor Balderstone is
something deaf, amongst his other accomplishments, so that much of what
he means should be spoken aside is overheard by the whole audience, and
especially by those from whom he is most anxious to conceal his private
manoeuvres. Hark!”

They listened, and heard the old domestic’s voice in conversation with
Mysie to the following effect:

“Just mak the best o’t--make the besto’t, woman; it’s easy to put a fair
face on ony thing.”

“But the auld brood-hen? She’ll be as teugh as bow-strings and
bend-leather!”

“Say ye made a mistake--say ye made a mistake, Mysie,” replied the
faithful seneschal, in a soothing and undertoned voice; “tak it a’ on
yoursell; never let the credit o’ the house suffer.”

“But the brood-hen,” remonstrated Mysie--“ou, she’s sitting some gate
aneath the dais in the hall, and I am feared to gae in in the dark for
the dogle; and if I didna see the bogle, I could as ill see the hen, for
it’s pit-mirk, and there’s no another light in the house, save that very
blessed lamp whilk the Master has in his ain hand. And if I had the hen,
she’s to pu’, and to draw, and to dress; how can I do that, and them
sitting by the only fire we have?”

“Weel, weel, Mysie,” said the butler, “bide ye there a wee, and I’ll try
to get the lamp wiled away frae them.”

Accordingly, Caleb Balderstone entered the apartment, little aware that
so much of his by-play had been audible there. “Well, Caleb, my old
friend, is there any chance of supper?” said the Master of Ravenswood.

“CHANCE of supper, your lordship?” said Caleb, with an emphasis of
strong scorn at the implied doubt. “How should there be ony question
of that, and us in your lordship’s house? Chance of supper, indeed! But
ye’ll no be for butcher-meat? There’s walth o’ fat poultry, ready either
for spit or brander. The fat capon, Mysie!” he added, calling out as
boldly as if such a thing had been in existence.

“Quite unnecessary,” said Bucklaw, who deemed himself bound in courtesy
to relieve some part of the anxious butler’s perplexity, “if you have
anything cold, or a morsel of bread.”

“The best of bannocks!” exclaimed Caleb, much relieve; “and, for cauld
meat, a’ that we hae is cauld eneugh,--how-beit, maist of the cauld meat
and pastry was gien to the poor folk after the ceremony of interment, as
gude reason was; nevertheless----”

“Come, Caleb,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “I must cut this matter
short. This is the young Laird of Bucklaw; he is under hiding, and
therefore, you know----”

“He’ll be nae nicer than your lordship’s honour, I’se warrant,” answered
Caleb, cheerfully, with a nod of intelligence; “I am sorry that the
gentleman is under distress, but I am blythe that he canna say muckle
agane our housekeeping, for I believe his ain pinches may matach ours;
no that we are pinched, thank God,” he added, retracting the admission
which he had made in his first burst of joy, “but nae doubt we are waur
aff than we hae been, or suld be. And for eating--what signifies telling
a lee? there’s just the hinder end of the mutton-ham that has been but
three times on the table, and the nearer the bane the sweeter, as your
honours weel ken; and--there’s the heel of the ewe-milk kebbuck, wi’ a
bit of nice butter, and--and--that’s a’ that’s to trust to.” And with
great alacrity he produced his slender stock of provisions, and placed
them with much formality upon a small round table betwixt the two
gentlemen, who were not deterred either by the homely quality or limited
quantity of the repast from doing it full justice. Caleb in the mean
while waited on them with grave officiousness, as if anxious to make up,
by his own respectful assiduity, for the want of all other attendance.

But, alas! how little on such occasions can form, however anxiously and
scrupulously observed, supply the lack of substantial fare! Bucklaw,
who had eagerly eaten a considerable portion of the thrice-sacked
mutton-ham, now began to demand ale.

“I wadna just presume to recommend our ale,” said Caleb; “the maut was
ill made, and there was awfu’ thunner last week; but siccan water as the
Tower well has ye’ll seldome see, Bucklaw, and that I’se engage for.”

“But if your ale is bad, you can let us have some wine,” said Bucklaw,
making a grimace at the mention of the pure element which Caleb so
earnestly recommended.

“Wine!” answered Caleb, undauntedly, “eneugh of wine! It was but twa
days syne--wae’s me for the cause--there was as much wine drunk in this
house as would have floated a pinnace. There never was lack of wine at
Wolf’s Crag.”

“Do fetch us some then,” said the master, “instead of talking about it.”
 And Caleb boldly departed.

Every expended butt in the old cellar did he set a-tilt, and shake with
the desperate expectation of collecting enough of the grounds of claret
to fill the large pewter measure which he carred in his hand. Alas!
each had been too devoutly drained; and, with all the squeezing and
manoeuvring which his craft as a butler suggested, he could only collect
about half a quart that seemed presentable. Still, however, Caleb was
too good a general to renounce the field without a strategem to cover
his retreat. He undauntedly threw down an empty flagon, as if he had
stumbled at the entrance of the apartment, called upon Mysie to wipe up
the wine that had never been spilt, and placing the other vessel on the
table, hoped there was still enough left for their honours. There
was indeed; for even Bucklaw, a sworn friend to the grape, found no
encouragement to renew his first attack upon the vintage of Wolf’s
Crag, but contented himself, however reluctantly, with a draught of
fair water. Arrangements were now made for his repose; and as the
secret chamber was assigned for this purpose, it furnished Caleb with a
first-rate and most plausible apology for all deficiencies of furniture,
bedding, etc.

“For wha,” said he, “would have thought of the secret chaumer being
needed? It has not been used since the time of the Gowrie Conspiracy,
and I durst never let a woman ken of the entrance to it, or your honour
will allow that it wad not hae been a secret chaumer lang.”





CHAPTER VIII.

     The hearth in hall was black and dead,
     No board was dight in bower within,
     Nor merry bowl nor welcome bed;
     “Here’s sorry cheer,” quoth the Heir of Linne.

     Old Ballad

THE feelings of the prodigal Heir of Linne, as expressed in that
excellent old song, when, after dissipating his whole fortune, he found
himself the deserted inhabitant of “the lonely lodge,” might perhaps
have some resemblance to those of the Master of Ravenswood in his
deserted mansion of Wolf’s Crag. The Master, however, had this advantage
over the spendthrift in the legend, that, if he was in similar distress,
he could not impute it to his own imprudence. His misery had been
bequeathed to him by his father, and, joined to his high blood, and to
a title which the courteous might give or the churlish withhold at their
pleasure, it was the whole inheritance he had derived from his ancestry.
Perhaps this melancholy yet consolatory reflection crossed the mind of
the unfortunate young nobleman with a breathing of comfort. Favourable
to calm reflection, as well as to the Muses, the morning, while it
dispelled the shades of night, had a composing and sedative effect upon
the stormy passions by which the Master of Ravenswood had been agitated
on the preceding day. He now felt himself able to analyse the different
feelings by which he was agitated, and much resolved to combat and
to subdue them. The morning, which had arisen calm and bright, gave a
pleasant effect even to the waste moorland view which was seen from the
castle on looking to the landward; and the glorious ocean, crisped with
a thousand rippling waves of silver, extended on the other side, in
awful yet complacent majesty, to the verge of the horizon. With such
scenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises even in its most
disturbed moods, and deeds of honour and virtue are inspired by their
majestic influence. To seek out Bucklaw in the retreat which he had
afforded him, was the first occupation of the Master, after he had
performed, with a scrutiny unusually severe, the important task of
self-examination. “How now, Bucklaw?” was his morning’s salutation--“how
like you the couch in which the exiled Earl of Angus once slept
in security, when he was pursued by the full energy of a king’s
resentment?”

“Umph!” returned the sleeper awakened; “I have little to complain of
where so great a man was quartered before me, only the mattress was of
the hardest, the vault somewhat damp, the rats rather more mutinous than
I would have expected from the state of Caleb’s larder; and if there had
been shutters to that grated window, or a curtain to the bed, I should
think it, upon the whole, an improvement in your accommodations.”

“It is, to be sure, forlorn enough,” said the Master, looking around the
small vault; “but if you will rise and leave it, Caleb will endeavour to
find you a better breakfast than your supper of last night.”

“Pray, let it be no better,” said Bucklaw, getting up, and endeavouring
to dress himself as well as the obscurity of the place would
permit--“let it, I say, be no better, if you mean me to preserve in my
proposed reformation. The very recollection of Caleb’s beverage has done
more to suppress my longing to open the day with a morning draught than
twenty sermons would have done. And you, master, have you been able to
give battle valiantly to your bosom-snake? You see I am in the way of
smothering my vipers one by one.”

“I have commenced the battle, at least, Bucklaw, adn I have had a fair
vision of an angel who descended to my assistance,” replied the Master.

“Woe’s me!” said his guest, “no vision can I expect, unless my aunt,
Lady Grinington, should betake herself to the tomb; and then it would be
the substance of her heritage rather than the appearance of her phantom
that I should consider as the support of my good resolutions. But this
same breakfast, Master--does the deer that is to make the pasty run yet
on foot, as the ballad has it?”

“I will inquire into that matter,” said his entertainer; and, leaving
the apartment, he went in search of Caleb, whom, after some difficulty,
he found in an obscure sort of dungeon, which had been in former times
the buttery of the castle. Here the old man was employed busily in the
doubtful task of burnishing a pewter flagon until it should take the
hue and semblance of silver-plate. “I think it may do--I think it might
pass, if they winna bring it ower muckle in the light o’ the window!”
 were the ejaculations which he muttered from time to time, as if to
encourage himself in his undertaking, when he was interrupted by the
voice of his master.

“Take this,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “and get what is necessary
for the family.” And with these words he gave to the old butler the
purse which had on the preceding evening so narrowly escaped the fangs
of Craigengelt.

The old man shook his silvery and thin locks, and looked with an
expression of the most heartfelt anguish at his master as he weighed in
his hand the slender treasure, and said in a sorrowful voice, “And is
this a’ that’s left?”

“All that is left at present,” said the Master, affecting more
cheerfulness than perhaps he really felt, “is just the green purse and
the wee pickle gowd, as the old song says; but we shall do better one
day, Caleb.”

“Before that day domes,” said Caleb, “I doubt there will be an end of
an auld sang, and an auld serving-man to boot. But it disna become me to
speak that gate to your honour, adn you looking sae pale. Tak back
the purse, and keep it to be making a show before company; for if your
honour would just take a bidding, adn be whiles taking it out afore folk
and putting it up again, there’s naebody would refuse us trust, for a’
that’s come and gane yet.”

“But, Caleb,” said the Master, “I still intend to leave this country
very soon, and desire to do so with the reputation of an honest man,
leaving no debty behind me, at last of my own contracting.”

“And gude right ye suld gang away as a true man, and so ye shall; for
auld Caleb can tak the wyte of whatever is taen on for the house, and
then it will be a’ just ae man’s burden; and I will live just as weel in
the tolbooth as out of it, and the credit of the family will be a’ safe
and sound.”

The Master endeavoured, in vain, to make Caleb comprehend that the
butler’s incurring the responsibility of debts in his own person would
rather add to than remove the objections which he had to their being
contracted. He spoke to a premier too busy in devising ways and means to
puzzle himself with refuting the arguments offered against their justice
or expediency.

“There’s Eppie Sma’trash will trust us for ale,” said Caleb to
himself--“she has lived a’ her life under the family--and maybe wi’ a
soup brandy; I canna say for wine--she is but a lone woman, and gets
her claret by a runlet at a time; but I’ll work a wee drap out o’ her by
fair means or foul. For doos, there’s the doocot; there will be poultry
amang the tenants, though Luckie Chirnside says she has paid the kain
twice ower. We’ll mak shift, an it like your honour--we’ll mak shift;
keep your heart abune, for the house sall haud its credit as lang as
auld Caleb is to the fore.”

The entertainment which the old man’s exertions of various kinds
enabled him to present to the young gentlemen for three or four days was
certainly of no splendid description, but it may readily be believed
it was set before no critical guests; and even the distresses, excuses,
evasions, and shifts of Caleb afforded amusement to the young men, and
added a sort of interest to the scrambling and irregular style of their
table. They had indeed occasion to seize on every circumstance that
might serve to diversify or enliven time, which otherwise passed away so
heavily.

Bucklaw, shut out from his usual field-sports and joyous carouses by the
necessity of remaining concealed within the walls of the castle, became
a joyless and uninteresting companion. When the Master of Ravenswood
would no longer fence or play at shovel-board; when he himself had
polished to the extremity the coat of his palfrey with brush, curry
comb, and hair-cloth; when he had seen him eat his provender, and
gently lie down in his stall, he could hardly help envying the animal’s
apparent acquiescence in a life so monotonous. “The stupid brute,” he
said, “thinks neither of the race-ground or the hunting-field, or
his green paddock at Bucklaw, but enjoys himself as comfortably when
haltered to the rack in this ruinous vault, as if he had been foaled
in it; and, I who have the freedom of a prisoner at large, to range
through the dungeons of this wretched old tower, can hardly,
betwixt whistling and sleeping, contrive to pass away the hour till
dinner-time.”

And with this disconsolate reflection, he wended his way to the bartizan
or battlements of the tower, to watch what objects might appear on the
distant moor, or to pelt, with pebbles and pieces of lime, the sea-mews
and cormorants which established themselves incautiously within the
reach of an idle young man.

Ravenswood, with a mind incalculably deeper and more powerful than that
of his companion, had his own anxious subjects of reflection, which
wrought for him the same unhappiness that sheer enui and want of
occupation inflicted on his companion. The first sight of Lucy Ashton
had been less impressive than her image proved to be upon reflection. As
the depth and violence of that revengeful passion by which he had been
actuated in seeking an interview with the father began to abate by
degrees, he looked back on his conduct towards the daughter as harsh
and unworthy towards a female of rank and beauty. Her looks of grateful
acknowledgment, her words of affectionate courtesy, had been repelled
with something which approached to disdain; and if the Master of
Ravenswood had sustained wrongs at the hand of Sir William Ashton, his
conscience told him they had been unhandsomely resented towards his
daughter. When his thoughts took this turn of self-reproach, the
recollection of Lucy Ashton’s beautiful features, rendered yet more
interesting by the circumstances in which their meeting had taken place,
made an impression upon his mind at once soothing and painful. The
sweetness of her voice, the delicacy of her expressions, the vivid glow
of her filial affection, embittered his regret at having repulsed her
gratitude with rudeness, while, at the same time, they placed before his
imagination a picture of the most seducing sweetness.

Even young Ravenswood’s strength of moral feeling and rectitude of
purpose at once increased the danger of cherishing these recollections,
and the propensity to entertain them. Firmly resolved as he was to
subdue, if possible, the predominating vice in his character, he
admitted with willingness--nay, he summoned up in his imagination--the
ideas by which it could be most powerfully counteracted; and, while he
did so, a sense of his own harsh conduct towards the daughter of his
enemy naturally induced him, as if by way of recompense, to invest her
with more of grace and beauty than perhaps she could actually claim.

Had any one at this period told the Master of Ravenswood that he had
so lately vowed vengeance against the whole lineage of him whom he
considered, not unjustly, as author of his father’s ruin and death, he
might at first have repelled the charge as a foul calumny; yet, upon
serious self-examination, he would have been compelled to admit that it
had, at one period, some foundation in truth, though, according to the
present tone of his sentiments, it was difficult to believe that this
had really been the case.

There already existed in his bosom two contradictory passions--a desire
to revenge the death of his father, strangely qualified by admiration of
his enemy’s daughter. Against the former feeling he had struggled, until
it seemed to him upon the wane; against the latter he used no means of
resistance, for he did not suspect its existence. That this was actually
the case was chiefly evinced by his resuming his resolution to leave
Scotland. Yet, though such was his purpose, he remained day after day at
Wolf’s Crag, without taking measures for carrying it into execution.
It is true, that he had written to one or two kinsmen who resided in a
distant quarter of Scotland, and particularly to the Marquis of A----,
intimating his purpose; and when pressed upon the subject by Bucklaw, he
was wont to allege the necessity of waiting for their reply, especially
that of the Marquis, before taking so decisive a measure.

The Marquis was rich and powerful; and although he was suspected to
entertain sentiments unfavourable to the government established at the
Revolution, he had nevertheless address enough to head a party in
the Scottish privy council, connected with the High Church faction in
England, and powerful enough to menace those to whom the Lord Keeper
adhered with a probable subversion of their power. The consulting with
a personage of such importance was a plausible excise, which Ravenswood
used to Bucklaw, and probably to himself, for continuing his residence
at Wolf’s Crag; and it was rendered yet more so by a general report
which began to be current of a probable change of ministers and measures
in the Scottish administration. The rumours, strongly asserted by
some, and as resolutely denied by others, as their wishes or interest
dictated, found their way even to the ruinous Tower of Wolf’s Crag,
chiefly through the medium of Caleb, the butler, who, among his other
excellences, was an ardent politician, and seldom made an excursion
from the old fortress to the neighbouring village of Wolf’s Hope without
bringing back what tidings were current in the vicinity.

But if Bucklaw could not offer any satisfactory objections to the delay
of the Master in leaving Scotland, he did not the less suffer with
impatience the state of inaction to which it confined him; and it was
only the ascendency which his new companion had acquired over him that
induced him to submit to a course of life so alien to his habits and
inclinations.

“You were wont to be thought a stirring active young fellow, Master,”
 was his frequent remonstrance; “yet here you seem determined to live
on and on like a rat in a hole, with this trifling difference, that the
wiser vermin chooses a hermitage where he can find food at least; but as
for us, Caleb’s excuses become longer as his diet turns more spare, and
I fear we shall realise the stories they tell of the slother: we have
almost eat up the last green leaf on the plant, and have nothing left
for it but to drop from the tree and break our necks.”

“Do not fear it,” said Ravenswood; “there is a fate watches for us, and
we too have a stake in the revolution that is now impending, and which
already has alarmed many a bosom.”

“What fate--what revolution?” inquired his companion. “We have had one
revolution too much already, I think.”

Ravenswood interrupted him by putting into his hands a letter.

“Oh,” answered Bucklaw, “my dream’s out. I thought I heard Caleb this
morning pressing some unfortunate fellow to a drink of cold water, and
assuring him it was better for his stomach in the morning than ale or
brandy.”

“It was my Lord of A----‘s courier,” said Ravenswood, “who was doomed to
experience his ostentatious hospitality, which I believe ended in sour
beer and herrings. Read, and you will see the news he has brought us.”
 “I will as fast as I can,” said Bucklaw; “but I am no great clerk, nor
does his lordship seem to be the first of scribes.”

The reader will peruse in, a few seconds, by the aid our friend
Ballantyne’s types, what took Bucklaw a good half hour in perusal,
though assisted by the Master of Ravenswood. The tenor was as follows:


“RIGHT HONOURABLE OUR COUSIN:

“Our hearty commendations premised, these come to assure you of the
interest which we take in your welfare, and in your purpose towards its
augmentation. If we have been less active in showing forth our effective
good-will towards you than, as a loving kinsman and blood-relative, we
would willingly have desired, we request that you will impute it to lack
of opportunity to show our good-liking, not to any coldness of our will
Touching your resolution to travel in foreign parts, as at this time we
hold the same little advisable, in respect that your ill-willers may,
according to the custom of such persons, impute motives for your
journey, whereof, although we know and believe you to be as clear as
ourselves, yet natheless their words may find credence in places where
the belief in them may much prejudice you, and which we should see with
more unwillingness and displeasure than with means of remedy.

“Having thus, as becometh our kindred, given you our poor mind on the
subject of your journeying forth of Scotland, we would willingly
add reasons of weight, which might materially advantage you and your
father’s house, thereby to determine you to abide at Wolf’s Crag, until
this harvest season shall be passed over. But what sayeth the proverb,
verbum sapienti--a word is more to him that hath wisdom than a sermon to
a fool. And albeit we have written this poor scroll with our own hand,
and are well assured of the fidelity of our messenger, as him that is
many ways bounden to us, yet so it is, that sliddery ways crave wary
walking, and that we may not peril upon paper matters which we would
gladly impart to you by word of mouth. Wherefore, it was our purpose to
have prayed you heartily to come to this our barren Highland country to
kill a stag, and to treat of the matters which we are now more painfully
inditing to you anent. But commodity does not serve at present for such
our meeting, which, therefore, shall be deferred until sic time as we
may in all mirth rehearse those things whereof we now keep silence.
Meantime, we pray you to think that we are, and will still be, your good
kinsman and well-wisher, waiting but for times of whilk we do, as it
were, entertain a twilight prospect, and appear and hope to be also your
effectual well-doer. And in which hope we heartily write ourself,

“Right Honourable,

“Your loving cousin,

“A----.
“Given from our poor house of B----,” etc.


Superscribed--“For the right honourable, and our honoured kinsman, the
Master of Ravenswood--These, with haste, haste, post haste--ride and run
until these be delivered.”

“What think you of this epistle, Bucklaw?” said the Master, when his
companion had hammered out all the sense, and almost all the words of
which it consisted.

“Truly, that the Marquis’s meaning is as great a riddle as his
manuscript. He is really in much need of _Wit’s Interpreter_, or the
_Complete Letter-Writer_, and were I you, I would send him a copy by the
bearer. He writes you very kindly to remain wasting your time and
your money in this vile, stupid, oppressed country, without so much as
offering you the countenance and shelter of his house. In my opinion, he
has some scheme in view in which he supposes you can be useful, and he
wishes to keep you at hand, to make use of you when it ripens,
reserving the power of turning you adrift, should his plot fail in the
concoction.”

“His plot! Then you suppose it is a treasonable business,” answered
Ravenswood.

“What else can it be?” replied Bucklaw; “the Marquis has been long
suspected to have an eye to Saint Germains.”

“He should not engage me rashly in such an adventure,” said Ravenswood;
“when I recollect the times of the first and second Charles, and of the
last James, truly I see little reason that, as a man or a patriot, I
should draw my sword for their descendants.”

“Humph!” replied Bucklaw; “so you have set yourself down to mourn over
the crop-eared dogs whom honest Claver’se treated as they deserved?”

“They first gave the dogs an ill name, and then hanged them,” replied
Ravenswood. “I hope to see the day when justice shall be open to Whig
and Tory, and when these nicknames shall only be used among coffee-house
politicians, as ‘slut’ and ‘jade’ are among apple-women, as cant terms
of idle spite and rancour.”

“That will nto be in our days, Master: the iron has entered too deeply
into our sides and our souls.”

“It will be, however, one day,” replied the Master; “men will not always
start at these nicknames as at a trumpet-sound. As social life is better
protected, its comforts will become too dear to be hazarded without some
better reasons than speculative politics.”

“It is fine talking,” answered Bucklaw; “but my heart is with the old
song--

     To see good corn upon the rigs,
     And a gallow built to hang the Whigs,
     And the right restored where the right should be.
     Oh, that is the thing that would wanton me.”

“You may sing as loudly as you will, cantabit vacuus----,” answered the
Master; “but I believe the Marquis is too wise, at least too wary, to
join you in such a burden. I suspect he alludes to a revolution in the
Scottish privy council, rather than in the British kingdoms.”

“Oh, confusion to your state tricks!” exclaimed Bucklaw--“your cold
calculating manoeuvres, which old gentlemen in wrought nightcaps
and furred gowns execute like so many games at chess, and displace a
treasurer or lord commissioner as they would take a rook or a pawn.
Tennis for my sport, and battle for my earnest! And you, Master, so dep
and considerate as you would seem, you have that within you makes
the blood boil faster than suits your present humour of moralising on
political truths. You are one of those wise men who see everything with
great composure till their blood is up, and then--woe to any one who
should put them in mind of their own prudential maxims!” “Perhaps,” said
Ravenswood, “you read me more rightly than I can myself. But to think
justly will certainly go some length in helping me to act so. But hark!
I hear Caleb tolling the dinner-bell.”

“Which he always does with the more sonorous grace in proportion to the
meagreness of the cheer which he has provided,” said Bucklaw; “as if
that infernal clang and jangle, which will one day bring the belfry
down the cliff, could convert a starved hen into a fat capon, and a
blade-bone of mutton into a haunch of venison.”

“I wish we may be so well off as your worst conjectures surmise,
Bucklaw, from the extreme solemnity and ceremony with which Caleb seems
to place on the table that solitary covered dish.”

“Uncover, Caleb! uncover, for Heaven’s sake!” said Bucklaw; “let us have
what you can give us without preface. Why, it stands well enough, man,”
 he continued, addressing impatiently the ancient butler, who, without
reply, kept shifting the dish, until he had at length placed it with
mathematical precision in the very midst of the table.

“What have we got here, Caleb?” inquired the Master in his turn.

“Ahem! sir, ye suld have known before; but his honour the Laird of
Bucklaw is so impatient,” answered Caleb, still holding the dish with
one hand and the cover with the other, with evident reluctance to
disclose the contents.

“But what is it, a God’s name--not a pair of clean spurs, I hope, in the
Border fashion of old times?”

“Ahem! ahem!” reiterated Caleb, “your honour is pleased to be facetious;
natheless, I might presume to say it was a convenient fashion, and used,
as I have heard, in an honourable and thriving family. But touching your
present dinner, I judged that this being St. Magdalen’s [Margaret’s]
Eve, who was a worthy queen of Scotland in her day, your honours might
judge it decorous, if not altogether to fast, yet only to sustain nature
with some slight refection, as ane saulted herring or the like.” And,
uncovering the dish, he displayed four of the savoury fishes which he
mentioned, adding, in a subdued tone, “that they were no just common
herring neither, being every ane melters, and sauted with uncommon care
by the housekeeper (poor Mysie) for his honour’s especial use.”

“Out upon all apologies!” said the Master, “let us eat the herrings,
since there is nothing better to be had; but I begin to think with you,
Bucklaw, that we are consuming the last green leaf, and that, in spite
of the Marquis’s political machinations, we must positively shift camp
for want of forage, without waiting the issue of them.”




CHAPTER IX.

     Ay, and when huntsmen wind the merry horn,
     And from its covert starts the fearful prey,
     Who, warm’d with youth’s blood in his swelling veins,
     Would, like a lifeless clod, outstretched lie,
     Shut out from all the fair creation offers?

     Ethwald, Act I. Scene 1.

LIGHT meals procure light slumbers; and therefore it is not surprising
that, considering the fare which Caleb’s conscience, or his necessity,
assuming, as will sometimes happen, that disguise, had assigned to the
guests of Wolf’s Crag, their slumbers should have been short.

In the morning Bucklaw rushed into his host’s apartment with a loud
halloo, which might have awaked the dead.

“Up! up! in the name of Heaven! The hunters are out, the only piece of
sport I have seen this month; and you lie here, Master, on a bed that
has little to recommend it, except that it may be something softer than
the stone floor of your ancestor’s vault.”

“I wish,” said Ravenswood, raising his head peevishly, “you had forborne
so early a jest, Mr. Hayston; it is really no pleasure to lose the very
short repose which I had just begun to enjoy, after a night spent in
thoughts upon fortune far harder than my couch, Bucklaw.”

“Pschaw, pshaw!” replied his guest; “get up--get up; the hounds are
abroad. I have saddled the horses myself, for old Caleb was calling for
grooms and lackeys, and would never have proceeded without two hours’
apology for the absence of men that were a hundred miles off. Get up,
Master; I say the hounds are out--get up, I say; the hunt is up.” And
off ran Bucklaw.

“And I say,” said the Master, rising slowly, “that nothing can concern
me less. Whose hounds come so near to us?”

“The Honourable Lord Brittlebrains’s,” answered Caleb, who had followed
the impatient Laird of Bucklaw into his master’s bedroom, “and truly I
ken nae title they have to be yowling and howling within the freedoms
and immunities of your lordship’s right of free forestry.”

“Nor I, Caleb,” replied Ravenswood, “excepting that they have bought
both the lands and the right of forestry, and may think themselves
entitled to exercise the rights they have paid their money for.”

“It may be sae, my lord,” replied Caleb; “but it’s no gentleman’s deed
of them to come here and exercise such-like right, and your lordship
living at your ain castle of Wolf’s Crag. Lord Brittlebrains would weel
to remember what his folk have been.”

“And what we now are,” said the Master, with suppressed bitterness of
feeling. “But reach me my cloak, Caleb, and I will indulge Bucklaw with
a sight of this chase. It is selfish to sacrifice my guest’s pleasure to
my own.”

“Sacrifice!” echoed Caleb, in a tone which seemed to imply the total
absurdity of his master making the least concession in deference to any
one--“sacrifice, indeed!--but I crave your honour’s pardon, and whilk
doublet is it your pleasure to wear?”

“Any one you will, Caleb; my wardrobe, I suppose, is not very
extensive.”

“Not extensive!” echoed his assistant; “when there is the grey and
silver that your lordship bestowed on Hew Hildebrand, your outrider;
and the French velvet that went with my lord your father--be gracious
to him!--my lord your father’s auld wardrobe to the puir friends of the
family; and the drap-de-Berry----”

“Which I gave to you, Caleb, and which, I suppose, is the only dress we
have any chance to come at, except that I wore yesterday; pray, hand me
that, and say no more about it.”

“If your honour has a fancy,” replied Caleb, “and doubtless it’s a
sad-coloured suit, and you are in mourning; nevertheless, I have never
tried on the drap-de-Berry--ill wad it become me--and your honour having
no change of claiths at this present--and it’s weel brushed, and as
there are leddies down yonder----”

“Ladies!” said Ravenswood; “and what ladies, pray?”

“What do I ken, your lordship? Looking down at them from the Warden’s
Tower, I could but see them glent by wi’ their bridles ringing and their
feathers fluttering, like the court of Elfland.”

“Well, well, Caleb,” replied the Master, “help me on with my cloak, and
hand me my sword-belt. What clatter is that in the courtyard?”

“Just Bucklaw bringing out the horses,” said Caleb, after a glance
through the window, “as if there werena men eneugh in the castle, or as
if I couldna serve the turn of ony o’ them that are out o’ the gate.”

“Alas! Caleb, we should want little if your ability were equal to your
will,” replied the Master.

“And I hope your lordship disna want that muckle,” said Caleb; “for,
considering a’ things, I trust we support the credit of the family as
weel as things will permit of,--only Bucklaw is aye sae frank and sae
forward. And there he has brought out your lordship’s palfrey, without
the saddle being decored wi’ the broidered sumpter-cloth! and I could
have brushed it in a minute.”

“It is all very well,” said his master, escaping from him and descending
the narrow and steep winding staircase which led to the courtyard.

“It MAY be a’ very weel,” said Caleb, somewhat peevishly; “but if your
lordship wad tarry a bit, I will tell you what will NOT be very weel.”

“And what is that?” said Ravenswood, impatiently, but stopping at the
same time.

“Why, just that ye suld speer ony gentleman hame to dinner; for I canna
mak anither fast on a feast day, as when I cam ower Bucklaw wi’ Queen
Margaret; and, to speak truth, if your lordship wad but please to cast
yoursell in the way of dining wi’ Lord Bittlebrains, I’se warrand I wad
cast about brawly for the morn; or if, stead o’ that, ye wad but dine
wi’ them at the change-house, ye might mak your shift for the awing: ye
might say ye had forgot your purse, or that the carline awed ye rent,
and that ye wad allow it in the settlement.”

“Or any other lie that cam uppermost, I suppose?” said his master.
“Good-bye, Caleb; I commend your care for the honour of the family.”
 And, throwing himself on his horse, he followed Bucklaw, who, at the
manifest risk of his neck, had begun to gallop down the steep path which
led from the Tower as soon as he saw Ravenswood have his foot in the
stirrup.

Caleb Balderstone looked anxiously after them, and shook his thin grey
locks: “And I trust they will come to no evil; but they have reached
the plain, and folk cannot say but that the horse are hearty and in
spirits.” Animated by the natural impetuosity and fire of his temper,
young Bucklaw rushed on with the careless speed of a whirlwind.
Ravenswood was scarce more moderate in his pace, for his was a mind
unwillingly roused from contemplative inactivity, but which, when once
put into motion, acquired a spirit of forcible and violent progression.
Neither was his eagerness proportioned in all cases to the motive of
impulse, but might be compared to the sped of a stone, which rushes with
like fury down the hill whether it was first put in motion by the arm of
a giant or the hand of a boy. He felt, therefore, in no ordinary degree,
the headlong impulse of the chase, a pastime so natural to youth of
all ranks, that it seems rather to be an inherent passion in our animal
nature, which levels all differences of rank and education, than an
acquired habit of rapid exercise.

The repeated bursts of the French horn, which was then always used for
the encouragement and direction of the hounds; the deep, though distant
baying of the pack; the half-heard cries of the huntsmen; the half-seen
forms which were discovered, now emerging from glens which crossed the
moor, now sweeping over its surface, now picking their way where it
was impeded by morasses; and, above all, the feeling of his own rapid
motion, animated the Master of Ravenswood, at last for the moment, above
the recollections of a more painful nature by which he was surrounded.
The first thing which recalled him to those unpleasing circumstances
was feeling that his horse, notwithstanding all the advantages which he
received from his rider’s knowledge of the country, was unable to keep
up with the chase. As he drew his bridle up with the bitter feeling
that his poverty excluded him from the favourite recreation of his
forefathers, and indeed their sole employment when not engaged in
military pursuits, he was accosted by a well-mounted stranger, who,
unobserved, had kept near him during the earlier part of his career.

“Your horse is blown,” said the man, with a complaisance seldom used in
a hunting-field. “Might I crave your honour to make use of mine?”

“Sir,” said Ravenswood, more surprised than pleased at such a proposal.
“I really do not know how I have merited such a favour at a stranger’s
hands.”

“Never ask a question about it, Master,” said Bucklaw, who, with great
unwillingness, had hitherto reined in his own gallant steed, not to
outride his host and entertainer. “Take the goods the gods provide you,
as the great John Dryden says; or stay--here, my friend, lend me that
horse; I see you have been puzzled to rein him up this half-hour. I’ll
take the devil out of him for you. Now, Master, do you ride mine, which
will carry you like an eagle.”

And throwing the rein of his own horse to the Master of Ravenswood, he
sprung upon that which the stranger resigned to him, and continued
his career at full speed. “Was ever so thoughtless a being!” said the
Master; “and you, my friend, how could you trust him with your horse?”

“The horse,” said the man, “belongs to a person who will make your
honour, or any of your honourable friends, most welcome to him, flesh
and fell.”

“And the owner’s name is----?” asked Ravenswood.

“Your honour must excuse me, you will learn that from himself. If you
please to take your friend’s horse, and leave me your galloway, I will
meet you after the fall of the stag, for I hear they are blowing him at
bay.”

“I believe, my friend, it will be the best way to recover your good
horse for you,” answered Ravenswood; and mounting the nag of his friend
Bucklaw, he made all the haste in his power to the spot where the blast
of the horn announced that the stag’s career was nearly terminated.

These jovial sounds were intermixed with the huntsmen’s shouts of “Hyke
a Talbot! Hyke a Teviot! now, boys, now!” and similar cheering halloos
of the olden hunting-field, to which the impatient yelling of the
hounds, now close of the object of their pursuit, gave a lively and
unremitting chorus. The straggling riders began now to rally towards the
scene of action, collecting from different points as to a common centre.

Bucklaw kept the start which he had gotten, and arrived first at the
spot, where the stag, incapable of sustaining a more prolonged flight,
had turned upon the hounds, and, in the hunter’s phrase, was at bay.
With his stately head bent down, his sides white with foam, his eyes
strained betwixt rage and terror, the hunted animal had now in his turn
become an object of intimidation to his pursuers. The hunters came
up one by one, and watched an opportunity to assail him with some
advantage, which, in such circumstances, can only be done with caution.
The dogs stood aloof and bayed loudly, intimating at once eagerness and
fear, and each of the sportsmen seemed to expect that his comrade would
take upon him the perilous task of assaulting and disabling the animal.
The ground, which was a hollow in the common or moor, afforded little
advantage for approaching the stag unobserved; and general was the shout
of triumph when Bucklaw, with the dexterity proper to an accomplished
cavalier of the day, sprang from his horse, and dashing suddenly and
swiftly at the stag, brought him to the ground by a cut on the hind leg
with his short hunting-sword. The pack, rushing in upon their disabled
enemy, soon ended his painful struggles, and solemnised his fall with
their clamour; the hunters, with their horns and voices, whooping and
blowing a mort, or death-note, which resounded far over the billows of
the adjacent ocean.

The huntsman then withdrew the hounds from the throttled stag, and on
his knee presented his knife to a fair female form, on a white palfrey,
whose terror, or perhaps her compassion, had till then kept her at some
distance. She wore a black silk riding-mask, which was then a common
fashion, as well for preserving the complexion from the sun and rain, as
from an idea of decorum, which did not permit a lady to appear barefaced
while engaged in a boisterous sport, and attended by a promiscuous
company. The richness of her dress, however, as well as the mettle and
form of her palfrey, together with the silvan compliment paid to her by
the huntsman, pointed her out to Bucklaw as the principal person in
the field. It was not without a feeling of pity, approaching even
to contempt, that this enthusiastic hunter observed her refuse the
huntsman’s knife, presented to her for the purpose of making the first
incision in the stag’s breast, and thereby discovering the venison. He
felt more than half inclined to pay his compliments to her; but it had
been Bucklaw’s misfortune, that his habits of life had not rendered
him familiarly acquainted with the higher and better classes of female
society, so that, with all his natural audacity, he felt sheepish and
bashful when it became necessary to address a lady of distinction.

Taking unto himself heart of grace (to use his own phrase), he did at
length summon up resolution enough to give the fair huntress good time
of the day, and trust that her sport had answered her expectation. Her
answer was very courteously and modestly expressed, and testified some
gratitude to the gallant cavalier, whose exploit had terminated the
chase so adroitly, when the hounds and huntsmen seemed somewhat at a
stand.

“Uds daggers and scabbard, madam,” said Bucklaw, whom this observation
brought at once upon his own ground, “there is no difficulty or merit in
that matter at all, so that a fellow is not too much afraid of having a
pair of antlers in his guts. I have hunted at force five hundred times,
madam; and I never yet saw the stag at bay, by land or water, but I
durst have gone roundly in on him. It is all use and wont, madam; and
I’ll tell you, madam, for all that, it must be done with good heed and
caution; and you will do well, madam, to have your hunting-sword right
sharp and double-edged, that you may strike either fore-handed or
back-handed, as you see reason, for a hurt with a buck’s horn is a
perilous ad somewhat venomous matter.”

“I am afraid, sir,” said the young lady, and her smile was scarce
concealed by her vizard, “I shall have little use for such careful
preparation.”

“But the gentleman says very right for all that, my lady,” said an
old huntsman, who had listened to Bucklaw’s harangue with no small
edification; “and I have heard my father say, who was a forester at the
Cabrach, that a wild boar’s gaunch is more easily healed than a hurt
from the deer’s horn, for so says the old woodman’s rhyme--

     If thou be hurt with horn of hart, it brings thee to they bier;
     But tusk of boar shall leeches heal, thereof have lesser fear.”

“An I might advise,” continued Bucklaw, who was now in his element, and
desirous of assuming the whole management, “as the hounds are surbated
and weary, the head of the stag should be cabaged in order to reward
them; and if I may presume to speak, the huntsman, who is to break up
the stag, ought to drink to your good ladyship’s health a good lusty
bicker of ale, or a tass of brandy; for if he breaks him up without
drinking, the venison will not keep well.”

This very agreeable prescription received, as will be readily believed,
all acceptation from the huntsman, who, in requital, offered to bucklaw
the compliment of his knife, which the young lady had declined.

This polite proffer was seconded by his mistress. “I believe, sir,” she
said, withdrawing herself from the circle, “that my father, for whose
amusement Lord Bittlebrain’s hounds have been out to-day, will readily
surrender all care of these matters to a gentleman of your experience.”

Then, bending gracefully from her horse, she wished him good morning,
and, attended by one or two domestics, who seemed immediately attached
to her service, retired from the scene of action, to which Bucklaw, too
much delighted with an opportunity of displaying his woodcraft to care
about man or woman either, paid little attention; but was soon stript to
his doublet, with tucked-up sleeves, and naked arms up to the elbows
in blood and grease, slashing, cutting, hacking, and hewing, with the
precision of Sir Tristrem himself, and wrangling and disputing with all
around him concerning nombles, briskets, flankards, and raven-bones,
then usual terms of the art of hunting, or of butchery, whichever the
reader chooses to call it, which are now probably antiquated.

When Ravenswood, who followed a short pace behind his friend, saw that
the stag had fallen, his temporary ardour for the chase gave way to that
feeling of reluctance which he endured at encountering in his fallen
fortunes the gaze whether of equals or inferiors. He reined up his horse
on the top of a gentle eminence, from which he observed the busy and gay
scene beneath him, and heard the whoops of the huntsmen, gaily mingled
with the cry of the dogs, and the neighing and trampling of the horses.
But these jovial sounds fell sadly on the ear of the ruined nobleman.
The chase, with all its train of excitations, has ever since feudal
times been accounted the almost exclusive privilege of the aristocracy,
and was anciently their chief employment in times of peace. The sense
that he was excluded by his situation from enjoying the silvan sport,
which his rank assigned to him as a special prerogative, and the feeling
that new men were now exercising it over the downs which had been
jealously reserved by his ancestors for their own amusement, while he,
the heir of the domain, was fain to hold himself at a distance from
their party, awakened reflections calculated to depress deeply a mind
like Ravenswood’s, which was naturally contemplative and melancholy. His
pride, however, soon shook off this feeling of dejection, and it gave
way to impatience upon finding that his volatile friend Bucklaw seemed
in no hurry to return with his borrowed steed, which Ravenswood, before
leaving the field, wished to see restored to the obliging owner. As he
was about to move towards the group of assembled huntsmen, he was joined
by a horseman, who, like himself, had kept aloof during the fall of the
deer.

This personage seemed stricken in years. He wore a scarlet cloak,
buttoning high upon his face, and his hat was unlooped and slouched,
probably by way of defence against the weather. His horse, a strong and
steady palfrey, was calculated for a rider who proposed to witness the
sport of the day rather than to share it. An attendant waited at some
distance, and the whole equipment was that of an elderly gentleman of
rank and fashion. He accosted Ravenswood very politely, but not without
some embarrassment.

“You seem a gallant young gentleman, sir,” he said, “and yet appear as
indifferent to this brave sport as if you had my load of years on your
shoulders.”

“I have followed the sport with more spirit on other occasions,” replied
the Master; “at present, late events in my family must be my apology;
and besides,” he added, “I was but indifferently mounted at the
beginning of the sport.”

“I think,” said the stranger, “one of my attendants had the sense to
accommodate your friend with a horse.”

“I was much indebted to his politeness and yours,” replied Ravenswood.
“My friend is Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, whom I dare say you will be
sure to find in the thick of the keenest sportsmen. He will return
your servant’s horse, and take my pony in exchange; and will add,”
 he concluded, turning his horse’s head from the stranger, “his best
acknowledgments to mine for the accommodation.”

The Master of Ravenswood, having thus expressed himself, began to move
homeward, with the manner of one who has taken leave of his company.
But the stranger was not so to be shaken off. He turned his horse at the
same time, and rode in the same direction, so near to the Master that,
without outriding him, which the formal civility of the time, and
the respect due to the stranger’s age and recent civility, would have
rendered improper, he could not easily escape from his company.

The stranger did not long remain silent. “This, then,” he said, “is the
ancient Castle of Wolf’s Crag, often mentioned in the Scottish records,”
 looking to the old tower, then darkening under the influence of a stormy
cloud, that formed its background; for at the distance of a short mile,
the chase, having been circuitous, had brought the hunters nearly back
to the point which they had attained when Ravenswood and Bucklaw had set
forward to join them.

Ravenswood answered this observation with a cold and distant assent.
“It was, as I have heard,” continued the stranger, unabashed by his
coldness, “one of the most early possessions of the honourable family of
Ravenswood.”

“Their earliest possession,” answered the Master, “and probably their
latest.”

“I--I--I should hope not, sir,” answered the stranger, clearing his
voice with more than one cough, and making an effort to overcome a
certain degree of hesitation; “Scotland knows what she owes to
this ancient family, and remembers their frequent and honourable
achievements. I have little doubt that, were it properly represented
to her Majesty that so ancient and noble a family were subjected to
dilapidation--I mean to decay--means might be found, ad re-aedificandum
antiquam domum----”

“I will save you the trouble, sir, of discussing this point farther,”
 interrupted the Master, haughtily. “I am the heir of that unfortunate
house--I am the Master of Ravenswood. And you, sir, who seem to be
a gentleman of fashion and education, must be sensible that the next
mortification after being unhappy is the being loaded with undesired
commiseration.”

“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the elder horseman; “I did not know--I am
sensible I ought not to have mentioned--nothing could be farther from my
thoughts than to suppose----”

“There are no apologies necessary, sir,” answered Ravenswood, “for here,
I suppose, our roads separate, and I assure you that we part in perfect
equanimity on my side.”

As speaking these words, he directed his horse’s head towards a narrow
causeway, the ancient approach to Wolf’s Crag, of which it might be
truly said, in the words of the Bard of Hope, that

     Frequented by few was the grass-cover’d road,
     Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trode,
     To his hills that encircle the sea.

But, ere he could disengage himself from his companion, the young lady
we have already mentioned came up to join the stranger, followed by her
servants.

“Daughter,” said the stranger to the unmasked damsel, “this is the
Master of Ravenswood.”

It would have been natural that the gentleman should have replied to
this introduction; but there was something in the graceful form and
retiring modesty of the female to whom he was thus presented, which not
only prevented him from inquiring to whom, and by whom, the annunciation
had been made, but which even for the time struck him absolutely mute.
At this moment the cloud which had long lowered above the height on
which Wolf’s Crag is situated, and which now, as it advanced, spread
itself in darker and denser folds both over land and sea, hiding the
distant objects and obscuring those which were nearer, turning the sea
to a leaden complexion and the heath to a darker brown, began now, by
one or two distant peals, to announce the thunders with which it was
fraught; while two flashes of lightning, following each other very
closely, showed in the distance the grey turrets of Wolf’s Crag, and,
more nearly, the rollowing billows of the ocean, crested suddenly with
red and dazzling light.

The horse of the fair huntress showed symptoms of impatience and
restiveness, and it became impossible for Ravenswood, as a man or a
gentleman, to leave her abruptly to the case of an aged father or her
menial attendants. He was, or believed himself, obliged in courtesy to
take hold of her bridle, and assist her in managing the unruly animal.
While he was thus engaged, the old gentleman observed that the storm
seemed to increase; that they were far from Lord Bittlebrains’s, whose
guests they were for the present; and that he would be obliged to the
Master of Ravenswood to point him the way to the nearest place of refuge
from the storm. At the same time he cast a wistful and embarrassed
look towards the Tower of Wolf’s Crag, which seemed to render it almost
impossible for the owner to avoid offering an old man and a lady, in
such an emergency, the temporary use of his house. Indeed, the condition
of the young huntress made this courtesy indispensable; for, in the
course of the services which he rendered, he could not but perceive that
she trembled much, and was extremely agitated, from her apprehensions,
doubtless, of the coming storm.

I know not if the Master of Ravenswood shared her terrors, but he was
not entirely free from something like a similar disorder of nerves, as
he observed, “The Tower of Wolf’s Crag has nothing to offer beyond the
shelter of its roof, but if that can be acceptable at such a moment----”
 he paused, as if the rest of the invitation stuck in his throat. But
the old gentleman, his self-constituted companion, did not allow him to
recede from the invitation, which he had rather suffered to be implied
than directly expressed.

“The storm,” said the stranger, “must be an apology for waiving
ceremony; his daughter’s health was weak, she had suffered much from a
recent alarm; he trusted their intrusion on the Master of Ravenswood’s
hospitality would not be altogether unpardonable in the circumstances of
the case: his child’s safety must be dearer to him than ceremony.”

There was no room to retreat. The Master of Ravenswood led the way,
continuing to keep hold of the lady’s bridle to prevent her horse
from starting at some unexpected explosion of thunder. He was not so
bewildered in his own hurried reflections but that he remarked, that the
deadly paleness which had occupied her neck and temples, and such of her
features as the riding-mask left exposed, gave place to a deep and rosy
suffusion; and he felt with embarrassment that a flush was by tacit
sympathy excited in his own cheeks. The stranger, with watchfulness
which he disguised under apprehensions of the safety of his daughter,
continued to observe the expression of the Master’s countenance as
they ascended the hill to Wolf’s Crag. When they stood in front of
that ancient fortress, Ravenswood’s emotions were of a very complicated
description; and as he led the way into the rude courtyard, and hallooed
to Caleb to give attendance, there was a tone of sternness, almost of
fierceness, which seemed somewhat alien from the courtesies of one who
is receiving honoured guests.

Caleb came; and not the paleness of the fair stranger at the first
approach of the thunder, nor the paleness of any other person, in any
other circumstances whatever, equalled that which overcame the thin
cheeks of the disconsolate seneschal when he beheld this accession
of guests to the castle, and reflected that the dinner hour was fast
approaching. “Is he daft?” he muttered to himself;--“is he clean daft
a’thegither, to bring lords and leddies, and a host of folk behint them,
and twal o’clock chappit?” Then approaching the Master, he craved pardon
for having permitted the rest of his people to go out to see the hunt,
observing, that “They wad never think of his lordship coming back till
mirk night, and that he dreaded they might play the truant.”

“Silence, Balderstone!” said Ravenswood, sternly; “your folly is
unseasonable. Sir and madam,” he said, turning to his guests, “this old
man, and a yet older and more imbecile female domestic, form my whole
retinue. Our means of refreshing you are more scanty than even so
miserable a retinue, and a dwelling so dilapidated, might seem to
promise you; but, such as they may chance to be, you may command them.”

The elder stranger, struck with the ruined and even savage appearance of
the Tower, rendered still more disconsolate by the lowering and gloomy
sky, and perhaps not altogether unmoved by the grave and determined
voice in which their host addressed them, looked round him anxiously, as
if he half repented the readiness with which he had accepted the offered
hospitality. But there was now no opportunity of receding from the
situation in which he had placed himself.

As for Caleb, he was so utterly stunned by his master’s public and
unqualified acknowledgment of the nakedness of the land, that for two
minutes he could only mutter within his hebdomadal beard, which had not
felt the razor for six days, “He’s daft--clean daft--red wud, and awa’
wit! But deil hae Caleb Balderstone,” said he, collecting his powers of
invention and resource, “if the family shall lose credit, if he were as
mad as the seven wise masters!” He then boldly advanced, and in spite
of his master’s frowns and impatience, gravely asked, “If he should
not serve up some slight refection for the young leddy, and a glass of
tokay, or old sack--or----”

“Truce to this ill-timed foolery,” said the Master, sternly; “put the
horses into the stable, and interrupt us no more with your absurdities.”

“Your honour’s pleasure is to be obeyed aboon a’ things,” said Caleb;
“nevertheless, as for the sack and tokay which it is not your noble
guests’ pleasure to accept----”

But here the voice of Bucklaw, heard even above the clattering of
hoofs and braying of horns with which it mingled, announced that he was
scaling the pathway to the Tower at the head of the greater part of the
gallant hunting train.

“The deil be in me,” said Caleb, taking heart in spite of this new
invasion of Philistines, “if they shall beat me yet! The hellicat
ne’er-do-weel! to bring such a crew here, that will expect to find
brandy as plenty as ditch-water, and he kenning sae absolutely the case
in whilk we stand for the present! But I trow, could I get rid of thae
gaping gowks of flunkies that hae won into the courtyard at the back
of their betters, as mony a man gets preferment, I could make a’ right
yet.”

The measures which he took to execute this dauntless resolution, the
reader shall learn in the next chapter.




CHAPTER X.

     With throat unslaked, with black lips baked,
     Agape they heard him call;
     Gramercy they for joy did grin,
     And all at once their breath drew in,
     As they had been drinking all!

     COLERIDGE’S Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

HAYSTON of Bucklaw was one of the thoughtless class who never hesitate
between their friend and their jest. When it was announced that the
principal persons of the chase had taken their route towards Wolf’s
Crag, the huntsmen, as a point of civility, offered to transfer the
venison to that mansion; a proffer which was readily accepted by
Bucklaw, who thought much of the astonishment which their arrival in
full body would occasion poor old Caleb Balderstone, and very little of
the dilemma to which he was about to expose his friend the Master, so
ill circumstanced to receive such a party. But in old Caleb he had to
do with a crafty and alert antagonist, prompt at supplying, upon all
emergencies, evasions and excuses suitable, as he thought, to the
dignity of the family.

“Praise be blest!” said Caleb to himself, “ae leaf of the muckle gate
has been swung to wi’ yestreen’s wind, and I think I can manage to shut
the ither.”

But he was desirous, like a prudent governor, at the same time to get
rid, if possible, of the internal enemy, in which light he considered
almost every one who eat and drank, ere he took measures to exclude
those whom their jocund noise now pronounced to be near at hand. He
waited, therefore, with impatience until his master had shown his two
principal guests into the Tower, and then commenced his operations.

“I think,” he said to the stranger menials, “that, as they are bringing
the stag’s head to the castle in all honour, we, who are indwellers,
should receive them at the gate.”

The unwary grooms had no sooner hurried out, in compliance with this
insidious hint, than, one folding-door of the ancient gate being already
closed by the wind, as has been already intimated, honest Caleb lost
no time in shutting the other with a clang, which resounded from
donjon-vault to battlement. Having thus secured the pass, he forthwith
indulged the excluded huntsmen in brief parley, from a small projecting
window, or shot-hole, through which, in former days, the warders were
wont to reconnoitre those who presented themselves before the gates. He
gave them to understand, in a short and pity speech, that the gate of
the castle was never on any account opened during meal-times; that his
honour, the Master of Ravenswood, and some guests of quality, had
just sat down to dinner; that there was excellent brandy at the
hostler-wife’s at Wolf’s Hope down below; and he held out some obscure
hint that the reckoning would be discharged by the Master; but this was
uttered in a very dubious and oracular strain, for, like Louis XIV.,
Caleb Balderstone hesitated to carry finesse so far as direct falsehood,
and was content to deceive, if possible, without directly lying.

This annunciation was received with surprise by some, with laughter
by others, and with dismay by the expelled lackeys, who endeavoured to
demonstrate that their right of readmission, for the purpose of waiting
upon their master and mistress, was at least indisputable. But Caleb was
not in a humour to understand or admit any distinctions. He stuck to his
original proposition with that dogged but convenient pertinacity which
is armed against all conviction, and deaf to all reasoning. Bucklaw now
came from the rear of the party, and demanded admittance in a very angry
tone. But the resolution of Caleb was immovable.

“If the king on the throne were at the gate,” he declared, “his ten
fingers should never open it contrair to the established use and wont of
the family of Ravenswood, and his duty as their head-servant.”

Bucklaw was now extremely incensed, and with more oaths and curses
than we care to repeat, declared himself most unworthily treated, and
demanded peremptorily to speak with the Master of Ravenswood himself.

But to this also Caleb turned a deaf ear. “He’s as soon a-bleeze as a
tap of tow, the lad Bucklaw,” he said; “but the deil of ony master’s
face he shall see till he has sleepit and waken’d on’t. He’ll ken
himsell better the morn’s morning. It sets the like o’ him, to be
bringing a crew of drunken hunters here, when he kens there is but
little preparation to sloken his ain drought.” And he disappeared from
the window, leaving them all to digest their exclusion as they best
might.

But another person, of whose presence Caleb, in the animation of the
debate, was not aware, had listened in silence to its progress. This
was the principal domestic of the stranger--a man of trust and
consequence--the same who, in the hunting-field, had accommodated
Bucklaw with the use of his horse. He was in the stable when Caleb had
contrived the expulsion of his fellow-servants, and thus avoided sharing
the same fate, from which his personal importance would certainly not
have otherwise saved him.

This personage perceived the manoeuvre of Caleb, easily appreciated the
motive of his conduct, and knowing his master’s intentions towards the
family of Ravenswood, had no difficulty as to the line of conduct he
ought to adopt. He took the place of Caleb (unperceived by the latter)
at the post of audience which he had just left, and announced to the
assembled domestics, “That it was his master’s pleasure that Lord
Bittlebrain’s retinue and his own should go down to the adjacent
change-house and call for what refreshments they might have occasion
for, and he should take care to discharge the lawing.”

The jolly troop of huntsmen retired from the inhospitable gate of Wolf’s
Crag, execrating, as they descended the steep pathway, the niggard and
unworthy disposition of the proprietor, and damning, with more than
silvan license, both the castle and its inhabitants. Bucklaw, with many
qualities which would have made him a man of worth and judgment in more
favourable circumstances, had been so utterly neglected in point of
education, that he was apt to think and feel according to the ideas of
the companions of his pleasures. The praises which had recently been
heaped upon himself he contrasted with the general abuse now levelled
against Ravenswood; he recalled to his mind the dull and monotonous days
he had spent in the Tower of Wolf’s Crag, compared with the joviality
of his usual life; he felt with great indignation his exclusion from
the castle, which he considered as a gross affront, and every mingled
feeling led him to break off the union which he had formed with the
Master of Ravenswood.

On arriving at the change-house of the village of Wolf’s Hope, he
unexpectedly met with an acquaintance just alighting from his horse.
This was no other than the very respectable Captain Craigengelt,
who immediately came up to him, and, without appearing to retain any
recollection of the indifferent terms on which they had parted, shook
him by the hand in the warmest manner possible. A warm grasp of the
hand was what Bucklaw could never help returning with cordiality, and no
sooner had Craigengelt felt the pressure of his fingers than he knew the
terms on which he stood with him.

“Long life to you, Bucklaw!” he exclaimed; “there’s life for honest folk
in this bad world yet!”

The Jacobites at this period, with what propriety I know not, used, it
must be noticed, the term of HONEST MEN as peculiarly descriptive of
their own party.

“Ay, and for others besides, it seems,” answered Bucklaw; “otherways,
how came you to venture hither, noble Captain?”

“Who--I? I am as free as the wind at Martinmas, that pays neither
land-rent nor annual; all is explained--all settled with the honest old
drivellers yonder of Auld Reekie. Pooh! pooh! they dared not keep me a
week of days in durance. A certain person has better friends among them
than you wot of, and can serve a friend when it is least likely.”

“Pshaw!” answered Hayston, who perfectly knew and thoroughly despised
the character of this man, “none of your cogging gibberish; tell me
truly, are you at liberty and in safety?”

“Free and safe as a Whig bailie on the causeway of his own borough, or a
canting Presbyterian minister in his own pulpit; and I came to tell you
that you need not remain in hiding any longer.”

“Then I suppose you call yourself my friend, Captain Craigengelt?” said
Bucklaw.

“Friend!” replied Craigengelt, “my cock of the pit! why, I am thy very
Achates, man, as I have heard scholars say--hand and glove--bark and
tree--thine to life and death!”

“I’ll try that in a moment,” answered Bucklaw. “Thou art never without
money, however thou comest by it. Lend me two pieces to wash the dust
out of these honest fellows’ throats in the first place, and then----”

“Two pieces! Twenty are at thy service, my lad, and twenty to back
them.”

“Ay, say you so?” said Bucklaw, pausing, for his natural penetration led
him to suspect some extraordinary motive lay couched under an excess of
generosity. “Craigengelt, you are either an honest fellow in right good
earnest, and I scarce know how to believe that; or you are cleverer than
I took you for, and I scarce know how to believe that either.”

“L’un n’empeche pas l’autre,” said Craigengelt. “Touch and try; the gold
is good as ever was weighed.”

He put a quantity of gold pieces into Bucklaw’s hand, which he thrust
into his pocket without either counting or looking at them, only
observing, “That he was so circumstanced that he must enlist, though
the devil offered the press-money”; and then turning to the huntsmen, he
called out, “Come along, my lads; all is at my cost.”

“Long life to Bucklaw!” shouted the men of the chase.

“And confusion to him that takes his share of the sport, and leaves the
hunters as dry as a drumhead,” added another, by way of corollary.

“The house of Ravenswood was ance a gude and an honourable house in
this land,” said an old man; “but it’s lost its credit this day, and the
Master has shown himself no better than a greedy cullion.”

And with this conclusion, which was unanimously agreed to by all who
heard it, they rushed tumultuously into the house of entertainment,
where they revelled till a late hour. The jovial temper of Bucklaw
seldom permitted him to be nice in the choice of his associates; and on
the present occasion, when his joyous debauch received additional
zest from the intervention of an unusual space of sobriety, and almost
abstinence, he was as happy in leading the revels as if his comrades had
been sons of princes. Craigengelt had his own purposes in fooling him up
to the top of his bent; and having some low humour, much impudence, and
the power of singing a good song, understanding besides thoroughly the
disposition of his regained associate, he headily succeeded in involving
him bumper-deep in the festivity of the meeting.


A very different scene was in the mean time passing in the Tower of
Wolf’s Crag. When the Master of Ravenswood left the courtyard, too
much busied with his own perplexed reflections to pay attention to the
manoeuvre of Caleb, he ushered his guests into the great hall of the
castle.

The indefatigable Balderstone, who, from choice or habit, worked on from
morning to night, had by degrees cleared this desolate apartment of the
confused relics of the funeral banquet, and restored it to some order.
But not all his skill and labour, in disposing to advantage the little
furniture which remained, could remove the dark and disconsolate
appearance of those ancient and disfurnished walls. The narrow windows,
flanked by deep indentures into the walls, seemed formed rather to
exclude than to admit the cheerful light; and the heavy and gloomy
appearance of the thunder-sky added still farther to the obscurity.

As Ravenswood, with the grace of a gallant of that period, but not
without a certain stiffness and embarrassment of manner, handed the
young lady to the upper end of the apartment, her father remained
standing more near to the door, as if about to disengage himself from
his hat and cloak. At this moment the clang of the portal was heard, a
sound at which the stranger started, stepped hastily to the window, and
looked with an air of alarm at Ravenswood, when he saw that the gate of
the court was shut, and his domestics excluded.

“You have nothing to fear, sir,” said Ravenswood, gravely; “this roof
retains the means of giving protection, though not welcome. Methinks,”
 he added, “it is time that I should know who they are that have thus
highly honoured my ruined dwelling!” The young lady remained silent
and motionless, and the father, to whom the question was more directly
addressed, seemed in the situation of a performer who has ventured to
take upon himself a part which he finds himself unable to present,
and who comes to a pause when it is most to be expected that he should
speak. While he endeavoured to cover his embarrassment with the exterior
ceremonials of a well-bred demeanour, it was obvious that, in making his
bow, one foot shuffled forward, as if to advance, the other backward, as
if with the purpose of escape; and as he undid the cape of his coat, and
raised his beaver from his face, his fingers fumbled as if the one had
been linked with rusted iron, or the other had weighed equal with a
stone of lead. The darkness of the sky seemed to increase, as if to
supply the want of those mufflings which he laid aside with such evident
reluctance. The impatience of Ravenswood increased also in proportion to
the delay of the stranger, and he appeared to struggle under agitation,
though probably from a very different cause. He laboured to restrain his
desire to speak, while the stranger, to all appearance, was at a loss
for words to express what he felt necessary to say.

At length Ravenswood’s impatience broke the bounds he had imposed upon
it. “I perceive,” he said, “that Sir William Ashton is unwilling to
announced himself in the Castle of Wolf’s Crag.”

“I had hoped it was unnecessary,” said the Lord Keeper, relieved from
his silence, as a spectre by the voice of the exorcist, “and I am
obliged to you, Master of Ravenswood, for breaking the ice at once,
where circumstances--unhappy circumstances, let me call them--rendered
self-introduction peculiarly awkward.”

“And I am not then,” said the Master of Ravenswood, gravely, “to
consider the honour of this visit as purely accidental?”

“Let us distinguish a little,” said the Keeper, assuming an appearance
of ease which perhaps his heart was a stranger to; “this is an honour
which I have eagerly desired for some time, but which I might never
have obtained, save for the accident of the storm. My daughter and I are
alike grateful for this opportunity of thanking the brave man to whom
she owes her life and I mine.”

The hatred which divided the great families in the feudal times had lost
little of its bitterness, though it no longer expressed itself in
deeds of open violence. Not the feelings which Ravenswood had begun to
entertain towards Lucy Ashton, not the hospitality due to his guests,
were able entirely to subdue, though they warmly combated, the deep
passions which arose within him at beholding his father’s foe standing
in the hall of the family of which he had in a great measure accelerated
the ruin. His looks glanced from the father to the daughter with an
irresolution of which Sir William Ashton did not think it proper
to await the conclusion. He had now disembarrassed himself of his
riding-dress, and walking up to his daughter, he undid the fastening of
her mask.

“Lucy, my love,” he said, raising her and leading her towards
Ravenswood, “lay aside your mask, and let us express our gratitude to
the Master openly and barefaced.”

“If he will condescend to accept it,” was all that Lucy uttered; but in
a tone so sweetly modulated, and which seemed to imply at once a feeling
and a forgiving of the cold reception to which they were exposed,
that, coming from a creature so innocent and so beautiful, her words cut
Ravenswood to the very heart for his harshness. He muttered something
of surprise, something of confusion, and, ending with a warm and eager
expression of his happiness at being able to afford her shelter under
his roof, he saluted her, as the ceremonial of the time enjoined upon
such occasions. Their cheeks had touched and were withdrawn from each
other; Ravenswood had not quitted the hand which he had taken in kindly
courtesy; a blush, which attached more consequence by far than was usual
to such ceremony, still mantled on Lucy Ashton’s beautiful cheek, when
the apartment was suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning, which
seemed absolutely to swallow the darkness of the hall. Every object
might have been for an instant seen distinctly. The slight and
half-sinking form of Lucy Ashton; the well-proportioned and stately
figure of Ravenswood, his dark features, and the fiery yet irresolute
expression of his eyes; the old arms and scutcheons which hung on the
walls of the apartment, were for an instant distinctly visible to the
Keeper by a strong red brilliant glare of light. Its disappearance was
almost instantly followed by a burst of thunder, for the storm-cloud was
very near the castle; and the peal was so sudden and dreadful, that the
old tower rocked to its foundation, and every inmate concluded it was
falling upon them. The soot, which had not been disturbed for centuries,
showered down the huge tunnelled chimneys; lime and dust flew in clouds
from the wall; and, whether the lightning had actually struck the castle
or whether through the violent concussion of the air, several heavy
stones were hurled from the mouldering battlements into the roaring
sea beneath. It might seem as if the ancient founder of the castle were
bestriding the thunderstorm, and proclaiming his displeasure at the
reconciliation of his descendant with the enemy of his house.

The consternation was general, and it required the efforts of both the
Lord Keeper and Ravenswood to keep Lucy from fainting. Thus was the
Master a second time engaged in the most delicate and dangerous of
all tasks, that of affording support and assistance to a beautiful and
helpless being, who, as seen before in a similar situation, had
already become a favourite of his imagination, both when awake and when
slumbering. If the genius of the house really condemned a union betwixt
the Master and his fair guest, the means by which he expressed his
sentiments were as unhappily chosen as if he had been a mere mortal.
The train of little attentions, absolutely necessary to soothe the young
lady’s mind, and aid her in composing her spirits, necessarily threw
the Master of Ravenswood into such an intercourse with her father as was
calculated, for the moment at least, to break down the barrier of feudal
enmity which divided them. To express himself churlishly, or even
coldly, towards an old man whose daughter (and SUCH a daughter) lay
before them, overpowered with natural terror--and all this under his own
roof, the thing was impossible; and by the time that Lucy, extending a
hand to each, was able to thank them for their kindness, the Master
felt that his sentiments of hostility towards the Lord Keeper were by no
means those most predominant in his bosom.

The weather, her state of health, the absence of her attendants,
all prevented the possibility of Lucy Ashton renewing her journey to
Bittlebrains House, which was full five miles distant; and the Master of
Ravenswood could not but, in common courtesy, offer the shelter of his
roof for the rest of the day and for the night. But a flush of less
soft expression, a look much more habitual to his features, resumed
predominance when he mentioned how meanly he was provided for the
entertainment of his guests.

“Do not mention deficiencies,” said the Lord Keeper, eager to interrupt
him and prevent his resuming an alarming topic; “you are preparing to
set out for the Continent, and your house is probably for the present
unfurnished. All this we understand; but if you mention inconvenience,
you will oblige us to seek accommodations in the hamlet.”

As the Master of Ravenswood was about to reply, the door of the hall
opened, and Caleb Balderstone rushed in.




CHAPTER XI.

     Let them have meat enough, woman--half a hen;
     There be old rotten pilchards--put them off too;
     ‘Tis but a little new anointing of them,
     And a strong onion, that confounds the savour.

     Love’s Pilgrimage.

THE thunderbolt, which had stunned all who were within hearing of it,
had only served to awaken the bold and inventive genius of the flower of
majors-domo. Almost before the clatter had ceased, and while there was
yet scarce an assurance whether the castle was standing or falling,
Caleb exclaimed, “Heaven be praised! this comes to hand like the boul of
a pint-stoup.” He then barred the kitchen door in the face of the Lord
Keeper’s servant, whom he perceived returning from the party at the
gate, and muttering, “How the deil cam he in?--but deil may care. Mysie,
what are ye sitting shaking and greeting in the chimney-neuk for? Come
here--or stay where ye are, and skirl as loud as ye can; it’s a’ ye’re
gude for. I say, ye auld deevil, skirl--skirl--louder--louder, woman;
gar the gentles hear ye in the ha’. I have heard ye as far off as the
Bass for a less matter. And stay--down wi’ that crockery----”

And with a sweeping blow, he threw down from a shelf some articles of
pewter and earthenware. He exalted his voice amid the clatter, shouting
and roaring in a manner which changed Mysie’s hysterical terrors of the
thunder into fears that her old fellow-servant was gone distracted. “He
has dung down a’ the bits o’ pigs, too--the only thing we had left
to haud a soup milk--and he has spilt the hatted hit that was for the
Master’s dinner. Mercy save us, the auld man’s gaen clean and clear wud
wi’ the thunner!”

“Haud your tongue, ye b----!” said Caleb, in the impetuous and
overbearing triumph of successful invention, “a’s provided now--dinner
and a’thing; the thunner’s done a’ in a clap of a hand!”

“Puir man, he’s muckle astray,” said Mysie, looking at him with a
mixture of pity and alarm; “I wish he may ever come hame to himsell
again.”

“Here, ye auld doited deevil,” said Caleb, still exulting
in his extrication from a dilemma which had seemed insurmountable;
“keep the strange man out of the kitchen; swear the thunner
came down the chimney and spoiled the best dinner ye ever
dressed--beef--bacon--kid--lark--leveret--wild-fowl--venison, and what
not. Lay it on thick, and never mind expenses. I’ll awa’ up to the
la’. Make a’ the confusion ye can; but be sure ye keep out the strange
servant.”

With these charges to his ally, Caleb posted up to the hall, but
stopping to reconnoitre through an aperture, which time, for the
convenience of many a domestic in succession, had made in the door, and
perceiving the situation of Miss Ashton, he had prudence enough to
make a pause, both to avoid adding to her alarm and in order to secure
attention to his account of the disastrous effects of the thunder.

But when he perceived that the lady was recovered, and heard the
conversation turn upon the accommodation and refreshment which the
castle afforded, he thought it time to burst into the room in the manner
announced in the last chapter.

“Willawins!--willawins! Such a misfortune to befa’ the house of
Ravenswood, and I to live to see it.”

“What is the matter, Caleb?” said his master, somewhat alarmed in his
turn; “has any part of the castle fallen?”

“Castle fa’an! na, but the sute’s fa’an, and the thunner’s come right
down the kitchen-lum, and the things are a’ lying here awa’, there awa’,
like the Laird o’ Hotchpotch’s lands; and wi’ brave guests of honour
and quality to entertain (a low bow here to Sir William Ashton and his
daughter), and naething left in the house fit to present for dinner, or
for supper either, for aught that I can see!”

“I very believe you, Caleb,” said Ravenswood, drily. Balderstone here
turned to his master a half-upbraiding, half-imploring countenance,
and edged towards him as he repeated, “It was nae great matter of
preparation; but just something added to your honour’s ordinary course
of fare--petty cover, as they say at the Louvre--three courses and the
fruit.”

“Keep your intolerable nonsense to yourself, you old fool!” said
Ravenswood, mortified at his officiousness, yet not knowing how to
contradict him, without the risk of giving rise to scenes yet more
ridiculous.

Caleb saw his advantage, and resolved to improve it. But first,
observing that the Lord Keeper’s servant entered the apartment and spoke
apart with his master, he took the same opportunity to whisper a few
words into Ravenswood’s ear: “Haud your tongue, for heaven’s sake, sir;
if it’s my pleasure to hazard my soul in telling lees for the honour
of the family, it’s nae business o’ yours; and if ye let me gang on
quietly, I’se be moderate in my banquet; but if ye contradict me, deil
but I dress ye a dinner fit for a duke!”

Ravenswood, in fact, thought it would be best to let his officious
butler run on, who proceeded to enumerate upon his fingers--“No muckle
provision--might hae served four persons of honour,--first course,
capons in white broth--roast kid--bacon with reverence; second course,
roasted leveret--butter crabs--a veal florentine; third course,
blackcock--it’s black eneugh now wi’ the sute--plumdamas--a tart--a
flam--and some nonsense sweet things, adn comfits--and that’s a’,”
 he said, seeing the impatience of his master--“that’s just a’ was
o’t--forbye the apples and pears.”

Miss Ashton had by degrees gathered her spirits, so far as to pay some
attention to what was going on; and observing the restrained impatience
of Ravenswood, contrasted with the peculiar determination of manner with
which Caleb detailed his imaginary banquet, the whole struck her as so
ridiculous that, despite every effort to the contrary, she burst into a
fit of incontrollable laughter, in which she was joined by her father,
though with more moderation, and finally by the Master of Ravenswood
himself, though conscious that the jest was at his own expense. Their
mirth--for a scene which we read with little emotion often appears
extremely ludicrous to the spectators--made the old vault ring again.
They ceased--they renewed--they ceased--they renewed again their shouts
of laughter! Caleb, in the mean time, stood his ground with a grave,
angry, and scornful dignity, which greatly enhanced the ridicule of the
scene and mirth of the spectators.

At length, when the voices, and nearly the strength, of the laughers
were exhausted, he exclaimed, with very little ceremony: “The deil’s in
the gentles! they breakfast sae lordly, that the loss of the best dinner
ever cook pat fingers to makes them as merry as if it were the best
jeest in a’ George Buchanan. If there was as little in your honours’
wames as there is in Caleb Balderstone’s, less caickling wad serve ye on
sic a gravaminous subject.”

Caleb’s blunt expression of resentment again awakened the mirth of the
company, which, by the way, he regarded not only as an aggression upon
the dignity of the family, but a special contempt of the eloquence with
which he himself had summed up the extent of their supposed losses. “A
description of a dinner,” as he said afterwards to Mysie, “that wad hae
made a fu’ man hungry, and them to sit there laughing at it!”

“But,” said Miss Ashton, composing her countenance as well as she could,
“are all these delicacies so totally destroyed that no scrap can be
collected?”

“Collected, my leddy! what wad ye collect out of the sute and the ass?
Ye may gang down yoursell, and look into our kitchen--the cookmaid in
the trembling exies--the gude vivers lying a’ about--beef, capons, and
white broth--florentine and flams--bacon wi’ reverence--and a’ the sweet
confections and whim-whams--ye’ll see them a’, my leddy--that is,” said
he, correcting himself, “ye’ll no see ony of them now, for the cook
has soopit them up, as was weel her part; but ye’ll see the white broth
where it was spilt. I pat my fingers in it, and it tastes as like sour
milk as ony thing else; if that isna the effect of thunner, I kenna what
is. This gentleman here couldna but hear the clash of our haill dishes,
china and silver thegither?”

The Lord Keeper’s domestic, though a statesman’s attendant, and of
course trained to command his countenance upon all occasions, was
somewhat discomposed by this appeal, to which he only answered by a bow.

“I think, Mr. Butler,” said the Lord Keeper, who began to be afraid lest
the prolongation of this scene should at length displease Ravenswood--“I
think that, were you to retire with my servant Lockhard--he has
travelled, and is quite accustomed to accidents and contingencies of
every kind, and I hope betwixt you, you may find out some mode of supply
at this emergency.”

“His honour kens,” said Caleb, who, however hopeless of himself
of accomplishing what was desirable, would, like the high-spirited
elephant, rather have died in the effort than brooked the aid of a
brother in commission--“his honour kens weel I need nae counsellor, when
the honour of the house is concerned.”

“I should be unjust if I denied it, Caleb,” said his master; “but your
art lies chiefly in making apologies, upon which we can no more dine
than upon the bill of fare of our thunder-blasted dinner. Now, possibly
Mr. Lockhard’s talent may consist in finding some substitute for that
which certainly is not, and has in all probability never been.”

“Your honour is pleased to be facetious,” said Caleb, “but I am sure
that, for the warst, for a walk as far as Wolf’s Hope, I could dine
forty men--no that the folk there deserve your honour’s custom. They hae
been ill advised in the matter of the duty eggs and butter, I winna deny
that.”

“Do go consult together,” said the Master; “go down to the village,
and do the best you can. We must not let our guests remain without
refreshment, to save the honour of a ruined family. And here, Caleb,
take my purse; I believe that will prove your best ally.”

“Purse! purse, indeed!” quoth Caleb, indignantly flinging out of the
room; “what suld I do wi’ your honour’s purse, on your ain grund? I
trust we are no to pay for our ain?”

The servants left the hall; and the door was no sooner shut than the
Lord Keeper began to apologise for the rudeness of his mirth; and Lucy
to hope she had given no pain or offence to the kind-hearted faithful
old man.

“Caleb and I must both learn, madam, to undergo with good humour, or at
least with patience, the ridicule which everywhere attaches itself to
poverty.”

“You do yourself injustice, Master of Ravenswood, on my word of honour,”
 answered his elder guest. “I believe I know more of your affairs than
you do yourself, and I hope to show you that I am interested in them;
and that--in short, that your prospects are better than you apprehend.
In the mean time, I can conceive nothing so respectable as the spirit
which rises above misfortune, and prefers honourable privations to debt
or dependence.”

Whether from fear of offending the delicacy or awakening the pride of
the Master, the Lord Keeper made these allusions with an appearance
of fearful and hesitating reserve, and seemed to be afraid that he was
intruding too far, in venturing to touch, however lightly, upon such a
topic, even when the Master had led to it. In short, he appeared at once
pushed on by his desire of appearing friendly, and held back by the fear
of intrusion. It was no wonder that the Master of Ravenswood, little
acquainted as he then was with life, should have given this consummate
courtier credit for more sincerity than was probably to be found in
a score of his cast. He answered, however, with reserve, that he was
indebted to all who might think well of him; and, apologising to his
guests, he left the hall, in order to make such arrangements for their
entertainment as circumstances admitted.

Upon consulting with old Mysie, the accommodations for the night were
easily completed, as indeed they admitted of little choice. The Master
surrendered his apartment for the use of Miss Ashton, and Mysie, once a
person of consequence, dressed in a black satin gown which had belonged
of yore to the Master’s grandmother, and had figured in the court-balls
of Henrietta Maria, went to attend her as lady’s-maid. He next inquired
after Bucklaw, and understanding he was at the change-house with the
huntsmen and some companions, he desired Caleb to call there, and
acquaint him how he was circumstanced at Wolf’s Crag; to intimate to him
that it would be most convenient if he could find a bed in the hamlet,
as the elder guest must necessarily be quartered in the secret chamber,
the only spare bedroom which could be made fit to receive him. The
Master saw no hardship in passing the night by the hall fire, wrapt in
his campaign-cloak; and to Scottish domestics of the day, even of the
highest rank, nay, to young men of family or fashion, on any pinch,
clean straw, or a dry hayloft, was always held good night-quarters.

For the rest, Lockhard had his master’s orders to bring some venison
from the inn, and Caleb was to trust to his wits for the honour of his
family. The Master, indeed, a second time held out his purse; but, as it
was in sight of the strange servant, the butler thought himself obliged
to decline what his fingers itched to clutch. “Couldna he hae slippit it
gently into my hand?” said Caleb; “but his honour will never learn how
to bear himsell in siccan cases.”

Mysie, in the mean time, according to a uniform custom in remote places
in Scotland, offered the strangers the produce of her little dairy,
“while better meat was getting ready.” And according to another custom,
not yet wholly in desuetude, as the storm was now drifting off to
leeward, the Master carried the Keeper to the top of his highest
tower to admire a wide and waste extent of view, and to “weary for his
dinner.”




CHAPTER XII.

     “Now dame,” quoth he, “Je vous dis sans doute,
     Had I nought of a capon but the liver,
     And of your white bread nought but a shiver,
     And after that a roasted pigge’s head
     (But I ne wold for me no beast were dead),
     Then had I with you homely sufferaunce.”

     CHAUCER, Summer’s Tale.

IT was not without some secret misgivings that Caleb set out upon
his exploratory expedition. In fact, it was attended with a treble
difficulty. He dared not tell his mast the offence which he had that
morning given to Bucklaw, just for the honour of the family; he dared
not acknowledge he had been too hasty in refusing the purse; and,
thirdly, he was somewhat apprehensive of unpleasant consequences upon
his meeting Hayston under the impression of an affront, and probably by
this time under the influence also of no small quantity of brandy.

Caleb, to do him justice, was as bold as any lion where the honour of
the family of Ravenswood was concerned; but his was that considerate
valour which does not delight in unnecessary risks. This, however, was a
secondary consideration; the main point was to veil the indigence of
the housekeeping at the castle, and to make good his vaunt of the cheer
which his resources could procure, without Lockhard’s assistance, and
without supplies from his master. This was as prime a point of honour
with him as with the generous elephant with whom we have already
compared him, who, being overtasked, broke his skull through the
desperate exertions which he made to discharge his duty, when he
perceived they were bringing up another to his assistance.

The village which they now approached had frequently afforded the
distressed butler resources upon similar emergencies; but his relations
with it had been of late much altered.

It was a little hamlet which straggled along the side of a creek formed
by the discharge of a small brook into the sea, and was hidden from
the castle, to which it had been in former times an appendage, by the
intervention of the shoulder of a hill forming a projecting headland.
It was called Wolf’s Hope (i.e. Wolf’s Haven), and the few inhabitants
gained a precarious subsistence by manning two or three fishing-boats
in the herring season, and smuggling gin and brandy during the
winter months. They paid a kind of hereditary respect to the Lords
of Ravenswood; but, in the difficulties of the family, most of the
inhabitants of Wolf’s Hope had contrived to get feu-rights to their
little possessions, their huts, kail-yards, and rights of commonty, so
that they were emancipated from the chains of feudal dependence,
and free from the various exactions with which, under every possible
pretext, or without any pretext at all, the Scottish landlords of the
period, themselves in great poverty, were wont to harass their still
poorer tenants at will. They might be, on the whole, termed independent,
a circumstance peculiarly galling to Caleb, who had been wont to
exercise over them the same sweeping authority in levying contributions
which was exercised in former times in England, when “the royal
purveyors, sallying forth from under the Gothic portcullis to purchase
provisions with power and prerogative, instead of money, brought home
the plunder of an hundred markets, and all that could be seized from
a flying and hiding country, and deposited their spoil in an hundred
caverns.”

Caleb loved the memory and resented the downfall of that authority,
which mimicked, on a petty scale, the grand contributions exacted by
the feudal sovereigns. And as he fondly flattered himself that the awful
rule and right supremacy, which assigned to the Barons of Ravenswood the
first and most effective interest in all productions of nature within
five miles of their castle, only slumbered, and was not departed
for ever, he used every now and then to give the recollection of the
inhabitants a little jog by some petty exaction. These were at first
submitted to, with more or less readiness, by the inhabitants of the
hamlet; for they had been so long used to consider the wants of the
Baron and his family as having a title to be preferred to their own,
that their actual independence did not convey to them an immediate sense
of freedom. They resembled a man that has been long fettered, who,
even at liberty, feels in imagination the grasp of the handcuffs still
binding his wrists. But the exercise of freedom is quickly followed with
the natural consciousness of its immunities, as the enlarged prisoner,
by the free use of his limbs, soon dispels the cramped feeling they had
acquired when bound.

The inhabitants of Wolf’s Hope began to grumble, to resist, and at
length positively to refuse compliance with the exactions of Caleb
Balderstone. It was in vain he reminded them, that when the eleventh
Lord Ravenswood, called the Skipper, from his delight in naval matters,
had encouraged the trade of their port by building the pier (a bulwark
of stones rudely piled together), which protected the fishing-boats from
the weather, it had been matter of understanding that he was to have
the first stone of butter after the calving of every cow within the
barony, and the first egg, thence called the Monday’s egg, laid by every
hen on every Monday in the year.

The feuars heard and scratched their heads, coughed, sneezed, and being
pressed for answer, rejoined with one voice, “They could not say”--the
universal refuge of a Scottish peasant when pressed to admit a claim
which his conscience owns, or perhaps his feelings, and his interest
inclines him to deny.

Caleb, however, furnished the notables of Wolf’s Hope with a note of
the requisition of butter and eggs, which he claimed as arrears of the
aforesaid subsidy, or kindly aid, payable as above mentioned; and having
intimated that he would not be averse to compound the same for goods or
money, if it was inconvenient to them to pay in kind, left them, as he
hoped, to debate the mode of assessing themselves for that purpose.
On the contrary, they met with a determined purpose of resisting the
exaction, and were only undecided as to the mode of grounding
their opposition, when the cooper, a very important person on a
fishing-station, and one of the conscript fathers of the village,
observed, “That their hens had caickled mony a day for the Lords of
Ravenswood, and it was time they suld caickle for those that gave
them roosts and barley.” An unanimous grin intimated the assent of the
assembly. “And,” continued the orator, “if it’s your wull, I’ll just tak
a step as far as Dunse for Davie Dingwall, the writer, that’s come frae
the North to settle amang us, and he’ll pit this job to rights, I’se
warrant him.”

A day was accordingly fixed for holding a grand palaver at Wolf’s Hope
on the subject of Caleb’s requisitions, and he was invited to attend at
the hamlet for that purpose.

He went with open hands and empty stomach, trusting to fill the one on
his master’s account and the other on his own score, at the expense of
the feuars of Wolf’s Hope. But, death to his hopes! as he entered the
eastern end of the straggling village, the awful form of Davie Dingwall,
a sly, dry, hard-fisted, shrewd country attorney, who had already acted
against the family of Ravenswood, and was a principal agent of Sir
William Ashton, trotted in at the western extremity, bestriding a
leathern portmanteau stuffed with the feu-charters of the hamlet, and
hoping he had not kept Mr. Balderstone waiting, “as he was instructed
and fully empowered to pay or receive, compound or compensate, and,
in fine, to age as accords respecting all mutual and unsettled claims
whatsoever, belonging or competent to the Honourable Edgar Ravenswood,
commonly called the Master of Ravenswood----”

“The RIGHT Honourable Edgar LORD RAVENSWOOD,” said Caleb, with great
emphasis; for, though conscious he had little chance of advantage in the
conflict to ensue, he was resolved not to sacrifice one jot of honour.

“Lord Ravenswood, then,” said the man of business--“we shall not quarrel
with you about titles of courtesy--commonly called Lord Ravenswood, or
Master of Ravenswood, heritable proprietor of the lands and barony of
Wolf’s Crag, on othe ne part, and to John Whitefish and others, feuars
in the town of Wolf’s Hope, within the barony aforesaid, on the other
part.”

Caleb was conscious, from sad experience, that he would wage a very
different strife with this mercenary champion than with the individual
feuars themselves, upon whose old recollections, predilections,
and habits of thinking he might have wrought by an hundred indirect
arguments, to which their deputy-representative was totally insensible.
The issue of the debate proved the reality of his apprehensions. It was
in vain he strained his eloquence and ingenuity, and collected into one
mass all arguments arising from antique custom and hereditary respect,
from the good deeds done by the Lords of Ravenswood to the community of
Wolf’s Hope in former days, and from what might be expected from them in
future. The writer stuck to the contents of his feu-charters; he could
not see it: ‘twas not in the bond. And when Caleb, determined to try
what a little spirit would do, deprecated the consequences of Lord
Ravenswood’s withdrawing his protection from the burgh, and even hinted
in his using active measures of resentment, the man of law sneered in
his face.

“His clients,” he said, “had determined to do the best they could for
their own town, and he thought Lord Ravenswood, since he was a lord,
might have enough to do to look after his own castle. As to any threats
of stouthrief oppression, by rule of thumb, or via facti, as the law
termed it, he would have Mr. Balderstone recollect, that new times were
not as old times; that they lived on the south of the Forth, and far
from the Highlands; that his clients thought they were able to protect
themselves; but should they find themselves mistaken, they would apply
to the government for the protection of a corporal and four red-coats,
who,” said Mr. Dingwall, with a grin, “would be perfectly able to secure
them against Lord Ravenswood, and all that he or his followers could do
by the strong hand.”

If Caleb could have concentrated all the lightnings of aristocracy in
his eye, to have struck dead this contemner of allegiance and privilege,
he would have launched them at his head, without respect to the
consequences. As it was, he was compelled to turn his course backward
to the castle; and there he remained for full half a day invisible and
inaccessible even to Mysie, sequestered in his own peculiar dungeon,
where he sat burnishing a single pewter plate and whistling “Maggie
Lauder” six hours without intermission.

The issue of this unfortunate requisition had shut against Caleb all
resources which could be derived from Wolf’s Hope and its purlieus, the
El Dorado, or Peru, from which, in all former cases of exigence, he had
been able to extract some assistance. He had, indeed, in a manner vowed
that the deil should have him, if ever he put the print of his foot
within its causeway again. He had hitherto kept his word; and, strange
to tell, this secession had, as he intended, in some degree, the effect
of a punishment upon the refractory feuars. Mr. Balderstone had been a
person in their eyes connected with a superior order of beings, whose
presence used to grace their little festivities, whose advice they found
useful on many occasions, and whose communications gave a sort of credit
to their village. The place, they acknowledged, “didna look as it used
to do, and should do, since Mr. Caleb keepit the castle sae closely;
but doubtless, touching the eggs and butter, it was a most unreasonable
demand, as Mr. Dingwall had justly made manifest.”

Thus stood matters betwixt the parties, when the old butler, though it
was gall and wormwood to him, found himself obliged either to ackowledge
before a strange man of quality, and, what was much worse, before that
stranger’s servant, the total inability of Wolf’s Crag to produce a
dinner, or he must trust to the compassion of the feuars of Wofl’s Hope.
It was a dreadful degradation; but necessity was equally imperious and
lawless. With these feelings he entered the street of the village.

Willing to shake himself from his companion as soon as possible, he
directed Mr. Lockhard to Luckie Sma-trash’s change-house, where a din,
proceeding from the revels of Bucklaw, Craigengelt, and their party,
sounded half-way down the street, while the red glare from the window
overpowered the grey twilight which was now settling down, and glimmered
against a parcel of old tubs, kegs, and barrels, piled up in the
cooper’s yard, on the other side of the way.

“If you, Mr. Lockhard,” said the old butler to his companion, “will be
pleased to step to the change-house where that light comes from, and
where, as I judge, they are now singing ‘Cauld Kail in Aberdeen,’ ye
may do your master’s errand about the venison, and I will do mine about
Bucklaw’s bed, as I return frae getting the rest of the vivers. It’s no
that the venison is actually needfu’,” he added, detaining his colleague
by the button, “to make up the dinner; but as a compliment to the
hunters, ye ken; and, Mr. Lockhard, if they offer ye a drink o’ yill, or
a cup o’ wine, or a glass o’ brandy, ye’ll be a wise man to take it,
in case the thunner should hae soured ours at the castle, whilk is ower
muckle to be dreaded.”

He then permitted Lockhard to depart; and with foot heavy as lead, and
yet far lighter than his heart, stepped on through the unequal street
of the straggling village, meditating on whom he ought to make his
first attack. It was necessary he should find some one with whom old
acknowledged greatness should weigh more than recent independence, and
to whom his application might appear an act of high dignity, relenting
at once and soothing. But he could not recollect an inhabitant of a mind
so constructed. “Our kail is like to be cauld eneugh too,” he reflected,
as the chorus of “Cauld Kail in Aberdeen” again reached his ears. The
minister--he had got his presentation from the late lord, but they had
quarrelled about teinds; the brewster’s wife--she had trusted long, and
the bill was aye scored up, and unless the dignity of the family should
actually require it, it would be a sin to distress a widow woman.
None was so able--but, on the other hand, none was likely to be less
willing--to stand his friend upon the present occasion, than Gibbie
Girder, the man of tubs and barrels already mentioned, who had headed
the insurrection in the matter of the egg and butter subsidy. “But
a’ comes o’ taking folk on the right side, I trow,” quoted Caleb to
himself; “and I had ance the ill hap to say he was but a Johnny New-come
in our town, and the carle bore the family an ill-will ever since.
But he married a bonny young quean, Jean Lightbody, auld Lightbody’s
daughter, him that was in the steading of Loup-the-Dyke; and auld
Lightbody was married himsell to Marion, that was about my lady in
the family forty years syne. I hae had mony a day’s daffing wi’ Jean’s
mither, and they say she bides on wi’ them. The carle has Jacobuses and
Georgiuses baith, an ane could get at them; and sure I am, it’s doing
him an honour him or his never deserved at our hand, the ungracious
sumph; and if he loses by us a’thegither, he is e’en cheap o’t: he can
spare it brawly.” Shaking off irresolution, therefore, and turning at
once upon his heel, Caleb walked hastily back to the cooper’s house,
lifted the latch withotu ceremony, and, in a moment, found himself
behind the “hallan,” or partition, from which position he could, himself
unseen, reconnoitre the interior of the “but,” or kitchen apartment, of
the mansion.

Reverse of the sad menage at the Castle of Wolf’s Crag, a bickering
fire roared up the cooper’s chimney. His wife, on the one side, in
her pearlings and pudding-sleeves, put the last finishing touch to
her holiday’s apparel, while she contemplated a very handsome and
good-humoured face in a broken mirror, raised upon the “bink” (the
shelves on which the plates are disposed) for her special accommodation.
Her mother, old Luckie Loup-the-Dyke, “a canty carline” as was within
twenty miles of her, according to the unanimous report of the “cummers,”
 or gossips, sat by the fire in the full glory of a grogram gown, lammer
beads, and a clean cockernony, whiffing a snug pipe of tobacco, and
superintending the affairs of the kitchen; for--sight more interesting
to the anxious heart and craving entrails of the desponding seneschal
than either buxom dame or canty cummer--there bubbled on the aforesaid
bickering fire a huge pot, or rather cauldron, steaming with beef and
brewis; while before it revolved two spits, turned each by one of the
cooper’s apprentices, seated in the opposite corners of the chimney, the
one loaded with a quarter of mutton, while the other was graced with a
fat goose and a brace of wild ducks. The sight and scent of such a
land of plenty almost wholly overcame the drooping spirits of Caleb. He
turned, for a moment’s space to reconnoitre the “ben,” or parlour end
of the house, and there saw a sight scarce less affecting to his
feelings--a large round table, covered for ten or twelve persons,
decored (according to his own favourite terms) with napery as white as
snow, grand flagons of pewter, intermixed with one or two silver cups,
containing, as was probable, something worthy the brilliancy of their
outward appearance, clean trenchers, cutty spoons, knives and forks,
sharp, burnished, and prompt for action, which lay all displayed as for
an especial festival.

“The devil’s in the peddling tub-coopering carl!” muttered Caleb, in all
the envy of astonishment; “it’s a shame to see the like o’ them gusting
their gabs at sic a rate. But if some o’ that gude cheer does not find
its way to Wolf’s Crag this night, my name is not Caleb Balderstone.”

So resolving, he entered the apartment, and, in all courteous greeting,
saluted both the mother and the daughter. Wolf’s Crag was the court of
the barony, Caleb prime minister at Wolf’s Crag; and it has ever been
remarked that, though the masculine subject who pays the taxes sometimes
growls at the courtiers by whom they are imposed, the said courtiers
continue, nevertheless, welcome to the fair sex, to whom they furnish
the newest small-talk and the earliest fashions. Both the dames were,
therefore, at once about old Caleb’s neck, setting up their throats
together by way of welcome.

“Ay, sirs, Mr. Balderstone, and is this you? A sight of you is gude for
sair een. Sit down--sit down; the gudeman will be blythe to see you--ye
nar saw him sae cadgy in your life; but we are to christen our bit wean
the night, as ye will hae heard, and doubtless ye will stay and see the
ordinance. We hae killed a wether, and ane o’ our lads has been out wi’
his gun at the moss; ye used to like wild-fowl.”

“Na, na, gudewife,” said Caleb; “I just keekit in to wish ye joy, and I
wad be glad to hae spoken wi’ the gudeman, but----” moving, as if to go
away.

“The ne’er a fit ye’s gang,” said the elder dame, laughing and holding
him fast, with a freedom which belonged to their old acquaintance;
“wha kens what ill it may bring to the bairn, if ye owerlook it in that
gate?”

“But I’m in a preceese hurry, gudewife,” said the butler, suffering
himself to be dragged to a seat without much resistance; “and as to
eating,” for he observed the mistress of the dwelling bustling about to
place a trencher for him--“as for eating--lack-a-day, we are just killed
up yonder wi’ eating frae morning to night! It’s shamefu’ epicurism; but
that’s what we hae gotten frae the English pock-puddings.” “Hout,
never mind the English pock-puddings,” said Luckie Lightbody; “try our
puddings, Mr. Balderstone; there is black pudding and white-hass; try
whilk ye like best.”

“Baith gude--baith excellent--canna be better; but the very smell is
eneugh for me that hae dined sae lately (the faithful wretch had fasted
since daybreak). But I wadna affront your housewifeskep, gudewife; and,
with your permission, I’se e’en pit them in my napkin, and eat them to
my supper at e’en, for I am wearied of Mysie’s pastry and nonsense; ye
ken landward dainties aye pleased me best, Marion, and landward lasses
too (looking at the cooper’s wife). Ne’er a bit but she looks far better
than when she married Gilbert, and then she was the bonniest lass in our
parochine and the neist till’t. But gawsie cow, goodly calf.”

The women smiled at the compliment each to herself, and they smiled
again to each other as Caleb wrapt up the puddings in a towel which he
had brought with him, as a dragoon carries his foraging bag to receive
what my fall in his way.

“And what news at the castle?” quo’ the gudewife.

“News! The bravest news ye ever heard--the Lord Keeper’s up yonder wi’
his fair daughter, just ready to fling her at my lord’s head, if he
winna tak her out o’ his arms; and I’se warrant he’ll stitch our auld
lands of Ravenswood to her petticoat tail.”

“Eh! sirs--ay!--and will hae her? and is she weel-favoured? and what’s
the colour o’ her hair? and does she wear a habit or a railly?” were the
questions which the females showered upon the butler.

“Hout tout! it wad tak a man a day to answer a’ your questions, and I
hae hardly a minute. Where’s the gudeman?”

“Awa’ to fetch the minister,” said Mrs. Girder, “precious Mr. Peter
Bide-the-Bent, frae the Mosshead; the honest man has the rheumatism wi’
lying in the hills in the persecution.”

“Ay! Whig and a mountain-man, nae less!” said Caleb, with a peevishness
he could not suppress. “I hae seen the day, Luckie, when worthy Mr.
Cuffcushion and the service-book would hae served your turn (to the
elder dame), or ony honest woman in like circumstances.”

“And that’s true too,” said Mrs. Lightbody, “but what can a body do?
Jean maun baith sing her psalms and busk her cockernony the gate the
gudeman likes, and nae ither gate; for he’s maister and mair at hame, I
can tell ye, Mr. Balderstone.”

“Ay, ay, and does he guide the gear too?” said Caleb, to whose projects
masculine rule boded little good. “Ilka penny on’t; but he’ll dress her
as dink as a daisy, as ye see; sae she has little reason to complain:
where there’s ane better aff there’s ten waur.”

“Aweel, gudewife,” said Caleb, crestfallen, but not beaten off, “that
wasna the way ye guided your gudeman; bt ilka land has its ain lauch.
I maun be ganging. I just wanted to round in the gudeman’s lug, that I
heard them say up-bye yonder that Peter Puncheon, that was cooper to the
Queen’s stores at the Timmer Burse at Leith, is dead; sae I though that
maybe a word frae my lord to the Lord Keeper might hae served Gilbert;
but since he’s frae hame----”

“O, but ye maun stay his hame-coming,” said the dame. “I aye telled
the gudeman ye meant weel to him; but he taks the tout at every bit
lippening word.”

“Aweel, I’ll stay the last minute I can.”

“And so,” said the handsome young spouse of Mr. Girder, “ye think this
Miss Ashton is weel-favoured? Troth, and sae should she, to set up for
our young lord, with a face and a hand, and a seat on his horse, that
might become a king’s son. D’ye ken that he aye glowers up at my window,
Mr. Balderstone, when he chaunces to ride thro’ the town? Sae I hae a
right to ken what like he is, as weel as ony body.”

“I ken that brawly,” said Caleb, “for I hae heard his lordship say the
cooper’s wife had the blackest ee in the barony; and I said, ‘Weel may
that be, my lord, for it was her mither’s afore her, as I ken to my
cost.’ Eh, Marion? Ha, ha, ha! Ah! these were merry days!”

“Hout awa’, auld carle,” said the old dame, “to speak sic daffing to
young folk. But, Jean--fie, woman, dinna ye hear the bairn greet? I’se
warrant it’s that dreary weid has come ower’t again.”

Up got mother and grandmother, and scoured away, jostling each other as
they ran, into some remote corner of the tenement, where the young hero
of the evening was deposited. When Caleb saw the coast fairly clear,
he took an invigorating pinch of snuff, to sharpen and confirm his
resolution.

“Cauld be my cast,” thought he, “if either Bide-the-Bent or Girder taste
that broach of wild-fowl this evening”; and then addressing the eldest
turnspit, a boy of about eleven years old, and putting a penny into his
hand, he said, “Here is twal pennies, my man; carry that ower to Mrs.
Sma’trash, and bid her fill my mill wi’ snishing, and I’ll turn the
broche for ye in the mean time; and she will gie ye a ginge-bread snap
for your pains.”

No sooner was the elder boy departed on this mission than Caleb, looking
the remaining turnspit gravely and steadily in the face, removed from
the fire the spit bearing the wild-fowl of which he had undertaken the
charge, clapped his hat on his head, and fairly marched off with it,
he stopped at the door of the change-house only to say, in a few brief
words, that Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw was not to expect a bed that evening
in the castle.

If this message was too briefly delivered by Caleb, it became absolute
rudeness when conveyed through the medium of a suburb landlady; and
Bucklaw was, as a more calm and temperate man might have been, highly
incensed. Captain Craigengelt proposed, with the unanimous applause of
all present, that they should course the old fox (meaning Caleb) ere he
got to cover, and toss him in a blanket. But Lockhard intimated to
his master’s servants and those of Lord Bittlebrains, in a tone of
authority, that the slightest impertinence to the Master of Ravenswood’s
domestic would give Sir William Ashton the highest offence. And having
so said, in a manner sufficient to prevent any aggression on their part,
he left the public-house, taking along with him two servants loaded with
such provisions as he had been able to procure, and overtook Caleb just
when he had cleared the village.




CHAPTER XIII.

     Should I take aught of you? ‘Tis true I begged now;
     And what is worse than that, I stole a kindness;
     And, what is worst of all, I lost my way in’t.

     Wit Without Money.

THE face of the little boy, sole witness of Caleb’s infringement upon
the laws at once of property and hospitality, would have made a good
picture. He sat motionless, as if he had witnessed some of the spectral
appearances which he had heard told of in a winter’s evening; and as he
forgot his own duty, and allowed his spit to stand still, he added to
the misfortunes of the evening by suffering the mutton to burn as black
as a coal. He was first recalled from his trance of astonishment by
a hearty cuff administered by Dame Lightbody, who, in whatever other
respects she might conform to her name, was a woman strong of person,
and expert in the use of her hands, as some say her deceased husband had
known to his cost.

“What garr’d ye let the roast burn, ye ill-clerkit gude-for-nought?”

“I dinna ken,” said the boy.

“And where’s that ill-deedy gett, Giles?”

“I dinna ken,” blubbered the astonished declarant.

“And where’s Mr. Balderstone?--and abune a’, and in the name of council
and kirk-session, that I suld say sae, where’s the broche wi’ the
wild-fowl?” As Mrs. Girder here entered, and joined her mother’s
exclamations, screaming into one ear while the old lady deafened the
other, they succeeded in so utterly confounding the unhappy urchin, that
he could not for some time tell his story at all, and it was only when
the elder boy returned that the truth began to dawn on their minds.

“Weel, sirs!” said Mrs. Lightbody, “wha wad hae thought o’ Caleb
Balderstone playing an auld acquaintance sic a pliskie!”

“Oh, weary on him!” said the spouse of Mr. Girder; “and what am I to
say to the gudeman? He’ll brain me, if there wasna anither woman in a’
Wolf’s Hope.”

“Hout tout, silly quean,” said the mother; “na, na, it’s come to muckle,
but it’s no come to that neither; for an he brain you he maun brain me,
and I have garr’d his betters stand back. Hands aff is fair play; we
maunna heed a bit flyting.”

The tramp of horses now announced the arrival of the cooper, with the
minister. They had no sooner dismounted than they made for the kitchen
fire, for the evening was cool after the thunderstorm, and the woods wet
and dirty. The young gudewife, strong in the charms of her Sunday gown
and biggonets, threw herself in the way of receiving the first attack,
while her mother, like the veteran division of the Roman legion,
remained in the rear, ready to support her in case of necessity. Both
hoped to protract the discovery of what had happened--the mother, by
interposing her bustling person betwixt Mr. Girder and the fire, and the
daughter, by the extreme cordiality with which she received the minister
and her husband, and the anxious fears which she expressed lest they
should have “gotten cauld.” “Cauld!” quoted the husband, surlily, for he
was not of that class of lords and masters whose wives are viceroys
over them, “we’ll be cauld eneugh, I think, if ye dinna let us in to the
fire.”

And so saying, he burst his way through both lines of defence; and, as
he had a careful eye over his property of every kind, he perceived at
one glance the absence of the spit with its savoury burden. “What the
deil, woman----”

“Fie for shame!” exclaimed both the women; “and before Mr.
Bide-the-Bent!”

“I stand reproved,” said the cooper; “but--”

“The taking in our mouths the name of the great enemy of our souls,”
 said Mr. Bide-the-Bent--

“I stand reproved,” said the cooper.

“--Is an exposing ourselves to his temptations,” continued the reverend
monitor, “and in inviting, or, in some sort, a compelling, of him to lay
aside his other trafficking with unhappy persons, and wait upon those in
whose speech his name is frequent.”

“Weel, weel, Mr. Bide-the-Bent, can a man do mair than stand reproved?”
 said the cooper; “but jest let me ask the women what for they hae dished
the wild-fowl before we came.”

“They arena dished, Gilbert,” said his wife; “but--but an accident----”

“What accident?” said Girder, with flashing eyes. “Nae ill come ower
them, I trust? Uh?”

His wife, who stood much in awe of him, durst not reply, but her mother
bustled up to her support, with arms disposed as if they were about to
be a-kimbo at the next reply.--“I gied them to an acquaintance of mine,
Gibbie Girder; and what about it now?”

Her excess of assurance struck Girder mute for an instant. “And YE gied
the wild-fowl, the best end of our christening dinner, to a friend of
yours, ye auld rudas! And what might HIS name be, I pray ye?”

“Just worthy Mr. Caleb Balderstone--frae Wolf’s Crag,” answered Marion,
prompt and prepared for battle.

Girder’s wrath foamed over all restraint. If there was a circumstance
which could have added to the resentment he felt, it was that this
extravagant donation had been made in favour of our friend Caleb,
towards whom, for reasons to which the reader is no stranger, he
nourished a decided resentment. He raised his riding-wand against the
elder matron, but she stood firm, collected in herself, and undauntedly
brandished the iron ladle with which she had just been “flambing”
 (Anglice, basting) the roast of mutton. Her weapon was certainly the
better, and her arm not the weakest of the two; so that Gilbert thought
it safest to turn short off upon his wife, who had by this time hatched
a sort of hysterical whine, which greatly moved the minister, who was in
fact as simple and kind-hearted a creature as ever breathed. “And you,
ye thowless jade, to sit still and see my substance disponed upon to
an idle, drunken, reprobate, worm-eaten serving-man, just because he
kittles the lugs o’ a silly auld wife wi’ useless clavers, and every twa
words a lee? I’ll gar you as gude----”

Here the minister interposed, both by voice and action, while Dame
Lightbody threw herself in front of her daughter, and flourished her
ladle.

“Am I no to chastise my ain wife?” exclaimed the cooper very
indignantly.

“Ye may chastise your ain wife if ye like,” answered Dame Lightbody;
“but ye shall never lay finger on my daughter, and that ye may found
upon.” “For shame, Mr. Girder!” said the clergyman; “this is what I
little expected to have seen of you, that you suld give rein to your
sinful passions against your nearest and your dearest, and this night
too, when ye are called to the most solemn duty of a Christian parent;
and a’ for what? For a redundancy of creature-comforts, as worthless as
they are unneedful.”

“Worthless!” exclaimed the cooper. “A better guse never walkit on
stubble; two finer, dentier wild ducks never wat a feather.”

“Be it sae, neighbour,” rejoined the minister; “but see what
superfluities are yet revolving before your fire. I have seen the day
when ten of the bannocks which stand upon that board would have been an
acceptable dainty to as many men, that were starving on hills and bogs,
and in caves of the earth, for the Gospel’s sake.”

“And that’s what vexes me maist of a’,” said the cooper, anxious to get
some one to sympathise with his not altogether causeless anger; “an the
quean had gien it to ony suffering sant, or to ony body ava but that
reaving, lying, oppressing Tory villain, that rade in the wicked troop
of militia when it was commanded out against the sants at Bothwell Brig
by the auld tyrant Allan Ravenswood, that is gane to his place, I wad
the less hae minded it. But to gie the principal parts o’ the feast to
the like o’ him----!”

“Aweel, Gilbert,” said the minister, “and dinna ye see a high judgment
in this? The seed of the righteous are not seen begging their bread:
think of the son of a powerful oppressor being brought to the pass of
supporting his household from your fulness.”

“And, besides,” said the wife, “it wasna for Lord Ravenswood neither,
an he wad hear but a body speak: it was to help to entertain the Lord
Keeper, as they ca’ him, that’s up yonder at Wolf’s Crag.”

“Sir William Ashton at Wolf’s Crag!” ejaculated the astonished man of
hoops and staves.

“And hand and glove wi’ Lord Ravenswood,” added Dame Lightbody.

“Doited idiot! that auld, clavering sneckdrawer wad gar ye trow the moon
is made of green cheese. The Lord Keeper and Ravenswood! they are cat
and dog, hare and hound.”

“I tell ye they are man and wife, and gree better than some others that
are sae,” retorted the mother-in-law; “forbye, Peter Puncheon, that’s
cooper the Queen’s stores, is dead, and the place is to fill, and----”

“Od guide us, wull ye haud your skirling tongues!” said Girder,--for
we are to remark, that this explanation was given like a catch for two
voices, the younger dame, much encouraged by the turn of the debate,
taking up and repeating in a higher tone the words as fast as they were
uttered by her mother.

“The gudewife says naething but what’s true, maister,” said Girder’s
foreman, who had come in during the fray. “I saw the Lord Keeper’s
servants drinking and driving ower at Luckie Sma’trash’s, ower-bye
yonder.”

“And is their maister up at Wolf’s Crag?” said Girder.

“Ay, troth is he,” replied his man of confidence.

“And friends wi’ Ravenswood?”

“It’s like sae,” answered the foreman, “since he is putting up wi’ him.”

“And Peter Puncheon’s dead?”

“Ay, ay, Puncheon has leaked out at last, the auld carle,” said the
foreman; “mony a dribble o’ brandy has gaen through him in his day. But
as for the broche and the wild-fowl, the saddle’s no aff your mare yet,
maister, and I could follow and bring it back, for Mr. Balderstone’s no
far aff the town yet.”

“Do sae, Will; and come here, I’ll tell ye what to do when ye owertake
him.”

He relieved the females of his presence, and gave Will his private
instructions.

“A bonny-like thing,” said the mother-in-law, as the cooper re-entered
the apartment, “to send the innocent lad after an armed man, when ye ken
Mr. Balderstone aye wears a rapier, and whiles a dirk into the bargain.”

“I trust,” said the minister, “ye have reflected weel on what ye have
done, lest you should minister cause of strife, of which it is my duty
to say, he who affordeth matter, albeit he himself striketh not, is in
no manner guiltless.”

“Never fash your beard, Mr. Bide-the-Bent,” replied Girder; “ane canna
get their breath out here between wives and ministers. I ken best how to
turn my ain cake. Jean, serve up the dinner, and nae mair about it.”

Nor did he again allude to the deficiency in the course of the evening.

Meantime, the foreman, mounted on his master’s steed, and charged with
his special orders, pricked swiftly forth in pursuit of the marauder
Caleb. That personage, it may be imagined, did not linger by the way. He
intermitted even his dearly-beloved chatter, for the purpose of making
more haste, only assuring Mr. Lockhard that he had made the purveyor’s
wife give the wild-fowl a few turns before the fire, in case that
Mysie, who had been so much alarmed by the thunder, should not have her
kitchen-grate in full splendour. Meanwhile, alleging the necessity of
being at Wolf’s Crag as soon as possible, he pushed on so fast that his
companions could scarce keep up with him. He began already to think he
was safe from pursuit, having gained the summit of the swelling eminence
which divides Wolf’s Crag from the village, when he heard the distant
tread of a horse, and a voice which shouted at intervals, “Mr.
Caleb--Mr. Balderstone--Mr. Caleb Balderstone--hollo--bide a wee!”

Caleb, it may be well believed, was in no hurry to acknowledge the
summons. First, he would not heart it, and faced his companions down,
that it was the echo of the wind; then he said it was not worth stopping
for; and, at length, halting reluctantly, as the figure of the horseman
appeared through the shades of the evening, he bent up his whole soul
to the task of defending his prey, threw himself into an attitude of
dignity, advanced the spit, which is his grasp might with its burden
seem both spear and shield, and firmly resolved to die rather than
surrender it.

What was his astonishment, when the cooper’s foreman, riding up and
addressing him with respect, told him: “His master was very sorry he was
absent when he came to his dwelling, and grieved that he could not tarry
the christening dinner; and that he had taen the freedom to send a sma’
runlet of sack, and ane anker of brandy, as he understood there were
guests at the castle, and that they were short of preparation.”

I have heard somewhere a story of an elderly gentleman who was pursued
by a bear that had gotten loose from its muzzle, until completely
exhausted. In a fit of desperation, he faced round upon Bruin and lifted
his cane; at the sight of which the instinct of discipline prevailed,
and the animal, instead of tearing him to pieces, rose up upon his
hind-legs and instantly began to shuffle a saraband. Not less than the
joyful surprise of the senior, who had supposed himself in the extremity
of peril from which he was thus unexpectedly relieved, was that of our
excellent friend Caleb, when he found the pursuer intended to add to
his prize, instead of bereaving him of it. He recovered his latitude,
however, instantly, so soon as the foreman, stooping from his nag, where
he sate perched betwixt the two barrels, whispered in his ear: “If
ony thing about Peter Puncheon’s place could be airted their way, John
[Gibbie] Girder wad mak it better to the Master of Ravenswood than
a pair of new gloves; and that he wad be blythe to speak wi’ Maister
Balderstone on that head, and he wad find him as pliant as a hoop-willow
in a’ that he could wish of him.”

Caleb heard all this without rendering any answer, except that of all
great men from Louis XIV. downwards, namely, “We will see about it”; and
then added aloud, for the edification of Mr. Lockhard: “Your master has
acted with becoming civility and attention in forwarding the liquors,
and I will not fail to represent it properly to my Lord Ravenswood. And,
my lad,” he said, “you may ride on to the castle, and if none of the
servants are returned, whilk is to be dreaded, as they make day and
night of it when they are out of sight, ye may put them into the
porter’s lodge, whilk is on the right hand of the great entry; the
porter has got leave to go to see his friends, sae ye will met no ane to
steer ye.”

The foreman, having received his orders, rode on; and having deposited
the casks in the deserted and ruinous porter’s lodge, he returned
unquestioned by any one. Having thus executed his master’s commission,
and doffed his bonnet to Caleb and his company as he repassed them in
his way to the village, he returned to have his share of the christening
festivity.




CHAPTER XIV.

     As, to the Autumn breeze’s bugle sound,

WE left Caleb Balderstone in the extremity of triumph at the success of
his various achievements for the honour of the house of Ravenswood. When
he had mustered and marshalled his dishes of divers kinds, a more royal
provision had not been seen in Wolf’s Crag since the funeral feast
of its deceased lord. Great was the glory of the serving-man, as he
“decored” the old oaken table with a clean cloth, and arranged upon it
carbonaded venison and roasted wild-fowl, with a glance, every now and
then, as if to upbraid the incredulity of his master and his guests; and
with many a story, more or less true, was Lockhard that evening regaled
concerning the ancient grandeur of Wolf’s Crag, and the sway of its
barons over the country in their neighbourhood.

“A vassal scarce held a calf or a lamb his ain, till he had first
asked if the Lord of Ravenswood was pleased to accept it; and they were
obliged to ask the lord’s consent before they married in these days,
and mony a merry tale they tell about that right as weel as others. And
although,” said Caleb, “these times are not like the gude auld times,
when authority had its right, yet true it is, Mr. Lockhard, and you
yoursell may partly have remarked, that we of the house of Ravenswood
do our endeavour in keeping up, by all just and lawful exertion of our
baronial authority, that due and fitting connexion betwixt superior and
vassal, whilk is in some danger of falling into desuetude, owing to the
general license and misrule of these present unhappy times.”

“Umph!” said Mr. Lockhard; “and if I may inquire, Mr. Balderstone, pray
do you find your people at the village yonder amenable? for I must needs
say, that at Ravenswood Castle, now pertaining to my master the Lord
Keeper, ye have not left behind ye the most compliant set of tenantry.”

“Ah! but Mr. Lockhard,” replied Caleb, “ye must consider there has been
a change of hands, and the auld lord might expect twa turns frae them,
when the new-comer canna get ane. A dour and fractious set they were,
thae tenants of Ravenswood, and ill to live wi’ when they dinna ken
their master; and if your master put them mad ance, the whole country
will not put them down.”

“Troth,” said Mr. Lockhard, “an such be the case, I think the wisest
thing for us a’ wad be to hammer up a match between your young lord and
our winsome young leddy up-bye there; and Sir William might just stitch
your auld barony to her gown-sleeve, and he wad sune cuitle another out
o’ somebody else, sic a lang head as he has.”

Caleb shook his head. “I wish,” he said--“I wish that may answer, Mr.
Lockhard. There are auld prophecies about this house I wad like ill to
see fulfilled wi’ my auld een, that has seen evil eneugh already.”

“Pshaw! never mind freits,” said his brother butler; “if the young folk
liked ane anither, they wad make a winsome couple. But, to say truth,
there is a leddy sits in our hall-neuk, maun have her hand in that as
weel as in every other job. But there’s no harm in drinking to their
healths, and I will fill Mrs. Mysie a cup of Mr. Girder’s canary.”


While they thus enjoyed themselves in the kitchen, the company in
the hall were not less pleasantly engaged. So soon as Ravenswood had
determined upon giving the Lord Keeper such hospitality as he had to
offer, he deemed it incumbent on him to assume the open and courteous
brow of a well-pleased host. It has been often remarked, that when a man
commences by acting a character, he frequently ends by adopting it in
good earnest. In the course of an hour or two, Ravenswood, to his own
surprise, found himself in the situation of one who frankly does his
best to entertain welcome and honoured guests. How much of this change
in his disposition was to be ascribed to the beauty and simplicity of
Miss Ashton, to the readiness with which she accommodated herself to the
inconveniences of her situation; how much to the smooth and plausible
conversation of the Lord Keeper, remarkably gifted with those words
which win the ear, must be left to the reader’s ingenuity to conjecture.
But Ravenswood was insensible to neither.

The Lord Keeper was a veteran statesman, well acquainted with courts
and cabinets, and intimate with all the various turns of public affairs
during the last eventful years of the 17th century. He could talk, from
his own knowledge, of men and events, in a way which failed not to win
attention, and had the peculiar art, while he never said a word which
committed himself, at the same time to persuade the hearer that he was
speaking without the least shadow of scrupulous caution or reserve.
Ravenswood, in spite of his prejudices and real grounds of resentment,
felt himself at once amused and instructed in listening to him, while
the statesman, whose inward feelings had at first so much impeded his
efforts to make himself known, had now regained all the ease and fluency
of a silver-tongued lawyer of the very highest order.

His daughter did not speak much, but she smiled; and what she did say
argued a submissive gentleness, and a desire to give pleasure, which,
to a proud man like Ravenswood, was more fascinating than the most
brilliant wit. Above all, he could not be observe that, whether from
gratitude or from some other motive, he himself, in his deserted and
unprovided hall, was as much the object of respectful attention to his
guests as he would have been when surrounded by all the appliances and
means of hospitality proper to his high birth. All deficiencies passed
unobserved, or, if they did not escape notice, it was to praise the
substitutes which Caleb had contrived to supply the want of the
usual accommodations. Where a smile was unavoidable, it was a very
good-humoured one, and often coupled with some well-turned compliment,
to show how much the guests esteemed the merits of their noble host,
how little they thought of the inconveniences with which they
were surrounded. I am not sure whether the pride of being found to
outbalance, in virtue of his own personal merit, all the disadvantages
of fortune, did not make as favourable an impression upon the haughty
heart of the Master of Ravenswood as the conversation of the father and
the beauty of Lucy Ashton.

The hour of repose arrived. The Keeper and his daughter retired to their
apartments, which were “decored” more properly than could have been
anticipated. In making the necessary arrangements, Mysie had indeed
enjoyed the assistance of a gossip who had arrived from the village upon
an exploratory expedition, but had been arrested by Caleb, and impressed
into the domestic drudgery of the evening; so that, instead of returning
home to describe the dress and person of the grand young lady, she found
herself compelled to be active in the domestic economy of Wolf’s Crag.

According to the custom of the time, the Master of Ravenswood attended
the Lord Keeper to his apartment, followed by Caleb, who placed on the
table, with all the ceremonials due to torches of wax, two rudely-framed
tallow-candles, such as in those days were only used by the peasantry,
hooped in paltry clasps of wire, which served for candlesticks. He then
disappeared, and presently entered with two earthen flagons (the china,
he said, had been little used since my lady’s time), one filled with
canary wine, the other with brandy. The canary sack, unheeding all
probabilities of detection, he declared had been twenty years in the
cellars of Wolf’s Crag, “though it was not for him to speak before their
honours; the brandy--it was weel-kenn’d liquor, as mild as mead and as
strong as Sampson; it had been in the house ever since the memorable
revel, in which auld Micklestob had been slain at the head of the stair
by Jamie of Jenklebrae, on account of the honour of the worshipful Lady
Muirend, wha was in some sort an ally of the family; natheless----”

“But to cut that matter short, Mr. Caleb,” said the Keeper, “perhaps you
will favour me with a ewer of water.”

“God forbid your lordship should drink water in this family,” replied
Caleb, “to the disgrace of so honourable an house!”

“Nevertheless, if his lordship have a fancy,” said the Master, smiling,
“I think you might indulge him; for, if I mistake not, there has been
water drank here at no distant date, and with good relish too.”

“To be sure, if his lordship has a fancy,” said Caleb; and re-entering
with a jug of pure element--“He will scarce find such water onywhere as
is drawn frae the well at Wolf’s Crag; nevertheless----”

“Nevertheless, we must leave the Lord Keeper to his repose in this
poor chamber of ours,” said the Master of Ravenswood, interrupting
his talkative domestic, who immediately turning to the doorway, with
a profound reverence, prepared to usher his master from the secret
chamber.

But the Lord Keeper prevented his host’s departure.--“I have but one
word to say to the Master of Ravenswood, Mr. Caleb, and I fancy he will
excuse your waiting.”

With a second reverence, lower than the former, Caleb withdrew; and his
master stood motionless, expecting, with considerable embarrassment,
what was to close the events of a day fraught with unexpected incidents.

“Master of Ravenswood,” said Sir William Ashton, with some
embarrassment, “I hope you understand the Christian law too well to
suffer the sun to set upon your anger.”

The Master blushed and replied, “He had no occasion that evening to
exercise the duty enjoined upon him by his Christian faith.”

“I should have thought otherwise,” said his guest, “considering the
various subjects of dispute and litigation which have unhappily occurred
more frequently than was desirable or necessary betwixt the late
honourable lord, your father, and myself.”

“I could wish, my lord,” said Ravenswood, agitated by suppressed
emotion, “that reference to these circumstances should be made anywhere
rather than under my father’s roof.”

“I should have felt the delicacy of this appeal at another time,” said
Sir William Ashton, “but now I must proceed with what I mean to say.
I have suffered too much in my own mind, from the false delicacy which
prevented my soliciting with earnestness, what indeed I frequently
requested, a personal communing with your father: much distress of mind
to him and to me might have been prevented.”

“It is true,” said Ravenswood, after a moment’s reflection, “I have
heard my father say your lordship had proposed a personal interview.”

“Proposed, my dear Master? I did indeed propose it; but I ought to have
begged, entreated, beseeched it. I ought to have torn away the veil,
which interested persons had stretched betwixt us, and shown myself as
I was, willing to sacrifice a considerable part even of my legal rights,
in order to conciliate feelings so natural as his must be allowed to
have been. Let me say for myself, my young friend, for so I will call
you, that had your father and I spent the same time together which
my good fortune has allowed me to-day to pass in your company, it is
possible the land might yet have enjoyed one of the most respectable of
its ancient nobility, and I should have been spared the pain of parting
in enmity from a person whose general character I so much admired and
honoured.”

He put his handkerchief to his eyes. Ravenswood also was moved, but
awaited in silence the progress of this extraordinary communication.

“It is necessary,” continued the Lord Keeper, “and proper that you
should understand, that there have been many points betwixt us, in
which, although I judged it proper that there should be an exact
ascertainment of my legal rights by the decree of a court of justice,
yet it was never my intention to press them beyond the verge of equity.”

“My lord,” said the Master of Ravenswood, “it is unnecessary to pursue
this topic farther. What the law will give you, or has given you, you
enjoy--or you shall enjoy; neither my father nor I myself would have
received anything on the footing of favour.”

“Favour! No, you misunderstand me,” resumed the Keeper; “or rather you
are no lawyer. A right may be good in law, and ascertained to be so,
which yet a man of honour may not in every case care to avail himself
of.”

“I am sorry for it, my lord,” said the Master.

“Nay, nay,” retorted his guest, “you speak like a young counsellor;
your spirit goes before your wit. There are many things still open for
decision betwixt us. Can you blame me, an old man desirous of peace, and
in the castle of a young nobleman who has saved my daughter’s life and
my own, that I am desirous, anxiously desirous, that these should be
settled on the most liberal principles?” The old man kept fast hold of
the Master’s passive hand as he spoke, and made it impossible for him,
be his predetermination what it would, to return any other than an
acquiescent reply; and wishing his guest good-night, he postponed
farther conference until the next morning.

Ravenswood hurried into the hall, where he was to spend the night, and
for a time traversed its pavement with a disordered and rapid pace.
His mortal foe was under his roof, yet his sentiments towards him were
neither those of a feudal enemy nor of a true Christian. He felt as if
he could neither forgive him in the one character, nor follow forth his
vengeance in the other, but that he was making a base and dishonourable
composition betwixt his resentment against the father and his affection
for his daughter. He cursed himself, as he hurried to and fro in the
pale moonlight, and more ruddy gleams of the expiring wood-fire. He
threw open and shut the latticed windows with violence, as if alike
impatient of the admission and exclusion of free air. At length,
however, the torrent of passion foamed off its madness, and he flung
himself into the chair which he proposed as his place of repose for the
night.

“If, in reality,” such were the calmer thoughts that followed the first
tempest of his passion--“if, in reality, this man desires no more than
the law allows him--if he is willing to adjust even his acknowledged
rights upon an equitable footing, what could be my father’s cause of
complaint?--what is mine? Those from who we won our ancient possessions
fell under the sword of my ancestors, and left lands and livings to the
conquerors; we sink under the force of the law, now too powerful for the
Scottish cavalry. Let us parley with the victors of the day, as if we
had been besieged in our fortress, and without hope of relief. This
man may be other than I have thought him; and his daughter--but I have
resolved not to think of her.”

He wrapt his cloak around him, fell asleep, and dreamed of Lucy Ashton
till daylight gleamed through the lattices.




CHAPTER XV.

     We worldly men, when we see friends and kinsmen
     Past hope sunk in their fortunes, lend no hand
     To lift them up, but rather set our feet
     Upon their heads to press them to the bottom,
     As I must yield with you I practised it;
     But now I see you in a way to rise,
     I can and will assist you.

     New Way to Pay Old Debts.

THE Lord Keeper carried with him, to a couch harder than he was
accustomed to stretch himself upon, the same ambitious thoughts and
political perplexities which drive sleep from the softest down that ever
spread a bed of state. He had sailed long enough amid the contending
tides and currents of the time to be sensible of their peril, and of
the necessity of trimming his vessel to the prevailing wind, if he would
have her escape shipwreck in the storm. The nature of his talents, and
the timorousness of disposition connected with them, had made him assume
the pliability of the versatile old Earl of Northampton, who explained
the art by which he kept his ground during all the changes of state,
from the reign of Henry VIII. to that of Elizabeth, by the frank avowal,
that he was born of the willow, not of the oak. It had accordingly been
Sir William Ashton’s policy, on all occasions, to watch the changes
in the political horizon, and, ere yet the conflict was decided, to
negotiate some interest for himself with the party most likely to prove
victorious. His time-serving disposition was well-known, and excited the
contempt of the more daring leaders of both factions in the state. But
his talents were of a useful and practical kind, and his legal
knowledge held in high estimation; and they so far counterbalanced other
deficiencies that those in power were glad to use and to reward, though
without absolutely trusting or greatly respecting, him.

The Marquis of A---- had used his utmost influence to effect a change in
the Scottish cabinet, and his schemes had been of late so well laid
and so ably supported, that there appeared a very great chance of his
proving ultimately successful. He did not, however, feel so strong or so
confident as to neglect any means of drawing recruits to his standard.
The acquisition of the Lord Keeper was deemed of some importance, and
a friend, perfectly acquainted with his circumstances and character,
became responsible for his political conversion.

When this gentleman arrived at Ravenswood Castle upon a visit, the real
purpose of which was disguised under general courtesy, he found the
prevailing fear which at present beset the Lord Keeper was that of
danger to his own person from the Master of Ravenswood. The language
which the blind sibyl, Old Alice, had used; the sudden appearance of the
Master, armed, and within his precincts, immediately after he had been
warned against danger from him; the cold and haughty return received in
exchange for the acknowledgments with which he loaded him for his timely
protection, had all made a strong impression on his imagination.

So soon as the Marquis’s political agent found how the wind sate,
he began to insinuate fears and doubts of another kind, scarce less
calculated to affect the Lord Keeper. He inquired with seeming interest,
whether the proceedings in Sir William’s complicated litigation with the
Ravenswood family were out of court, and settled without the possibility
of appeal. The Lord Keeper answered in the affirmative; but his
interrogator was too well informed to be imposed upon. He pointed out to
him, by unanswerable arguments, that some of the most important points
which had been decided in his favour against the house of Ravenswood
were liable, under the Treaty of Union, to be reviewed by the British
House of Peers, a court of equity of which the Lord Keeper felt an
instinctive dread. This course came instead of an appeal to the old
Scottish Parliament, or, as it was technically termed, “a protestation
for remeid in law.”

The Lord Keeper, after he had for some time disputed the legality of
such a proceeding, was compelled, at length, to comfort himself with
the improbability of the young Master of Ravenswood’s finding friends in
parliament capable of stirring in so weighty an affair.

“Do not comfort yourself with that false hope,” said his wily friend;
“it is possible that, in the next session of Parliament, young
Ravenswood may find more friends and favour even than your lordship.”

“That would be a sight worth seeing,” said the Keeper, scornfully.

“And yet,” said his friend, “such things have been seen ere now, and in
our own time. There are many at the head of affairs even now that a few
years ago were under hiding for their lives; and many a man now dines
on plate of silver that was fain to eat his crowdy without a bicker; and
many a high head has been brought full low among us in as short a space.
Scott of Scotsarvet’s Staggering State of Scots Statesmen, of which
curious memoir you showed me a manuscript, has been outstaggered in our
time.”

The Lord Keeper answered with a deep sigh, “That these mutations were no
new sights in Scotland, and had been witnessed long before the time of
the satirical author he had quoted. It was many a long year,” he said,
“since Fordun had quoted as an ancient proverb, ‘Neque dives, neque
fortis, sed nec sapiens Scotus, praedominante invidia, diu durabit in
terra.’”

“And be assured, my esteemed friend,” was the answer, “that even your
long services to the state, or deep legal knowledge, will not save you,
or render your estate stable, if the Marquis of A---- comes in with
a party in the British Parliament. You know that the deceased Lord
Ravenswood was his near ally, his lady being fifth in descent from the
Knight of Tillibardine; and I am well assured that he will take young
Ravenswood by the hand, and be his very good lord and kinsman. Why
should he not? The Master is an active and stirring young fellow, able
to help himself with tongue and hands; and it is such as he that
finds friends among their kindred, and not those unarmed and unable
Mephibosheths that are sure to be a burden to every one that takes them
up. And so, if these Ravenswood cases be called over the coals in the
House of Peers, you will find that the Marquis will have a crow to pluck
with you.”

“That would be an evil requital,” said the Lord Keeper, “for my long
services to the state, and the ancient respect in which I have held his
lordship’s honourable family and person.”

“Ay, but,” rejoined the agent of the Marquis, “it is in vain to look
back on past service and auld respect, my lord; it will be present
service and immediate proofs of regard which, in these sliddery times,
will be expected by a man like the Marquis.”

The Lord Keeper now saw the full drift of his friend’s argument, but he
was too cautious to return any positive answer.

“He knew not,” he said, “the service which the Lord Marquis could expect
from one of his limited abilities, that had not always stood at his
command, still saving and reserving his duty to his king and country.”

Having thus said nothing, while he seemed to say everything, for the
exception was calculated to cover whatever he might afterwards think
proper to bring under it, Sir William Ashton changed the conversation,
nor did he again permit the same topic to be introduced. His guest
departed, without having brought the wily old statesman the length
of committing himself, or of pledging himself to any future line of
conduct, but with the certainty that he had alarmed his fears in a most
sensible point, and laid a foundation for future and farther treaty.

When he rendered an account of his negotiation to the Marquis, they
both agreed that the Keeper ought not to be permitted to relapse into
security, and that he should be plied with new subjects of alarm,
especially during the absence of his lady. They were well aware that her
proud, vindictive, and predominating spirit would be likely to supply
him with the courage in which he was deficient; that she was immovably
attached to the party now in power, with whom she maintained a close
correspondence and alliance; and that she hated, without fearing, the
Ravenswood family (whose more ancient dignity threw discredit on the
newly acquired grandeur of her husband) to such a degree that she would
have perilled the interest of her own house to have the prospect of
altogether crushing that of her enemy.

But Lady Ashton was now absent. The business which had long detained her
in Edinburgh had afterwards induced her to travel to London, not without
the hope that she might contribute her share to disconcert the
intrigues of the Marquis at court; for she stood high in favour with
the celebrated Sarah Duchesss of Marlborough, to whom, in point of
character, she bore considerable resemblance. It was necessary to press
her husband hard before her return; and, as a preparatory step, the
Marquis wrote to the Master of Ravenswood the letter which we rehearsed
in a former chapter. It was cautiously worded, so as to leave it in the
power of the writer hereafter to take as deep or as slight an interest
in the fortunes of his kinsmen as the progress of his own schemes might
require. But however unwilling, as a statesman, the Marquis might be
to commit himself, or assume the character of a patron, while he had
nothing to give away, it must be said to his honour that he felt a
strong inclination effectually to befriend the Master of Ravenswood, as
well as to use his name as a means of alarming the terrors of the Lord
Keeper.

As the messenger who carried this letter was to pass near the house of
the Lord Keeper, he had it in direction that, in the village adjoining
to the park-gate of the castle, his horse should lose a shoe, and that,
while it was replaced by the smith of the place, he should express the
utmost regret for the necessary loss of time, and in the vehemence of
his impatience give it to be understood that he was bearing a message
from the Marquis of A---- to the Master of Ravenswood upon a matter of
life and death.

This news, with exaggerations, was speedily carried from various
quarters to the ears of the Lord Keeper, and each reporter dwelt upon
the extreme impatience of the courier, and the surprising short time
in which he had executed his journey. The anxious statesman heard in
silence; but in private Lockhard received orders to watch the courier
on his return, to waylay him in the village, to ply him with liquor, if
possible, and to use all means, fair or foul, to learn the contents
of the letter of which he was the bearer. But as this plot had been
foreseen, the messenger returned by a different and distant road, and
thus escaped the snare that was laid for him.

After he had been in vain expected for some time, Mr. Dingwall had
orders to made especial inquiry among his clients of Wolf’s Hope,
whether such a domestic belonging to the Marquis of A----had actually
arrived at the neighbouring castle. This was easily ascertained; for
Caleb had been in the village one morning by five o’clock, to borrow
“twa chappins of ale and a kipper” for the messenger’s refreshment,
and the poor fellow had been ill for twenty-four hours at Luckie
Sma’trash’s, in consequence of dining upon “saut saumon and sour drink.”
 So that the existence of a correspondence betwixt the Marquis and his
distressed kinsman, which Sir William Ashton had sometimes treated as a
bugbear, was proved beyond the possibility of further doubt.

The alarm of the Lord Keeper became very serious; since the Claim of
Right, the power of appealing from the decisions of the civil court to
the Estates of Parliament, which had formerly been held incompetent, had
in many instances been claimed, and in some allowed, and he had no small
reason to apprehend the issue, if the English House of Lords should be
disposed to act upon an appeal from the Master of Ravenswood “for remeid
in law.” It would resolve into an equitable claim, and be decided,
perhaps, upon the broad principles of justice, which were not quite so
favourable to the Lord Keeper as those of strict law. Besides, judging,
though most inaccurately, from courts which he had himself known in the
unhappy times preceding the Scottish Union, the Keeper might have too
much right to think that, in the House to which his lawsuits were to be
transferred, the old maxim might prevail which was too well recognised
in Scotland in former times: “Show me the man, and I’ll show you the
law.” The high and unbiased character of English judicial proceedings
was then little known in Scotland, and the extension of them to that
country was one of the most valuable advantages which it gained by the
Union. But this was a blessing which the Lord Keeper, who had lived
under another system, could not have the means of foreseeing. In the
loss of his political consequence, he anticipated the loss of his
lawsuit. Meanwhile, every report which reached him served to render
the success of the Marquis’s intrigues the more probable, and the Lord
Keeper began to think it indispensable that he should look round for
some kind of protection against the coming storm. The timidity of his
temper induced him to adopt measures of compromise and conciliation. The
affair of the wild bull, properly managed, might, he thought, be made
to facilitate a personal communication and reconciliation betwixt the
Master and himself. He would then learn, if possible, what his own ideas
were of the extent of his rights, and the means of enforcing them; and
perhaps matters might be brought to a compromise, where one party was
wealthy and the other so very poor. A reconciliation with Ravenswood was
likely to give him an opportunity to play his own game with the Marquis
of A----. “And besides,” said he to himself, “it will be an act of
generosity to raise up the heir of this distressed family; and if he is
to be warmly and effectually befriended by the new government, who knows
but my virtue may prove its own reward?”

Thus thought Sir William Ashton, covering with no unusual self-delusion
his interested views with a hue of virtue; and having attained this
point, his fancy strayed still farther. He began to bethink himself,
“That if Ravenswood was to have a distinguished place of power and
trust, and if such a union would sopite the heavier part of his
unadjusted claims, there might be worse matches for his daughter Lucy:
the Master might be reponed against the attainder. Lord Ravenswood was
an ancient title, and the alliance would, in some measure, legitimate
his own possession of the greater part of the Master’s spoils, and make
the surrender of the rest a subject of less bitter regret.”

With these mingled and multifarious plans occupying his head, the Lord
Keeper availed himself of my Lord Bittlebrains’s repeated invitation
to his residence, and thus came within a very few miles of Wolf’s
Crag. Here he found the lord of the mansion absent, but was courteously
received by the lady, who expected her husband’s immediate return. She
expressed her particular delight at seeing Miss Ashton, and appointed
the hounds to be taken out for the Lord Keeper’s special amusement.
He readily entered into the proposal, as giving him an opportunity to
reconnoitre Wolf’s Crag, and perhaps to make some acquaintance with the
owner, if he should be tempted from his desolate mansion by the
chase. Lockhard had his orders to endeavour on his part to make some
acquaintance with the inmates of the castle, and we have seen how he
played his part.

The accidental storm did more to further the Lord Keeper’s plan of
forming a personal acquaintance with young Ravenswood than his most
sanguine expectations could have anticipated. His fear of the young
nobleman’s personal resentment had greatly decreased since he considered
him as formidable from his legal claims and the means he might have of
enforcing them. But although he thought, not unreasonably, that only
desperate circumstances drove men on desperate measures, it was not
without a secret terror, which shook his heart within him, that he first
felt himself inclosed within the desolate Tower of Wolf’s Crag; a place
so well fitted, from solitude and strength, to be a scene of violence
and vengeance. The stern reception at first given to them by the Master
of Ravenswood, and the difficulty he felt in explaining to that injured
nobleman what guests were under the shelter of his roof, did not soothe
these alarms; so that when Sir William Ashton heard the door of the
courtyard shut behind him with violence, the words of Alice rung in his
ears, “That he had drawn on matters too hardly with so fierce a race as
those of Ravenswood, and that they would bide their time to be avenged.”

The subsequent frankness of the Master’s hospitality, as their
acquaintance increased, abated the apprehensions these recollections
were calculated to excite; and it did not escape Sir William Ashton,
that it was to Lucy’s grace and beauty he owed the change in their
host’s behavior.

All these thoughts thronged upon him when he took possession of
the secret chamber. The iron lamp, the unfurnished apartment, more
resembling a prison than a place of ordinary repose, the hoarse and
ceaseless sound of the waves rushing against the base of the rock on
which the castle was founded, saddened and perplexed his mind. To his
own successful machinations, the ruin of the family had been in a great
measure owing, but his disposition was crafty, and not cruel; so
that actually to witness the desolation and distress he had himself
occasioned was as painful to him as it would be to the humane mistress
of a family to superintend in person the execution of the lambs and
poultry which are killed by her own directions. At the same time,
when he thought of the alternative of restoring to Ravenswood a large
proportion of his spoils, or of adopting, as an ally and member of his
own family, the heir of this impoverished house, he felt as the spider
may be supposed to do when his whole web, the intricacies of which had
been planned with so much art, is destroyed by the chance sweep of a
broom. And then, if he should commit himself too far in this matter, it
gave rise to a perilous question, which many a good husband, when under
temptation to act as a free agent, has asked himself without being able
to return a satisfactory answer: “What will my wife--what will Lady
Ashton say?” On the whole, he came at length to the resolution in
which minds of a weaker cast so often take refuge. He resolved to
watch events, to take advantage of circumstances as they occurred, and
regulate his conduct accordingly. In this spirit of temporising policy,
he at length composed his mind to rest.




CHAPTER XVI.

     A slight note I have about me for you, for the delivery of which
     you must excuse me. It is an offer that friendship calls upon me
     to do, and no way offensive to you, since I desire nothing but
     right upon both sides.

     King and no King.

WHEN Ravenswood and his guest met in the morning, the gloom of the
Master’s spirit had in part returned. He, also, had passed a night
rather of reflection that of slumber; and the feelings which he could
not but entertain towards Lucy Ashton had to support a severe conflict
against those which he had so long nourished against her father. To
clasp in friendship the hand of the enemy of his house, to entertain him
under his roof, to exchange with him the courtesies and the kindness of
domestic familiarity, was a degradation which his proud spirit could not
be bent to without a struggle.

But the ice being once broken, the Lord Keeper was resolved it should
not have time against to freeze. It had been part of his plan to stun
and confuse Ravenswood’s ideas, by a complicated and technical statement
of the matters which had been in debate betwixt their families, justly
thinking that it would be difficult for a youth of his age to follow
the expositions of a practical lawyer, concerning actions of compt and
reckoning, and of multiplepoindings, and adjudications and wadsets,
proper and improper, and poindings of the ground, and declarations of
the expiry of the legal. “Thus,” thought Sir William, “I shall have
all the grace of appearing perfectly communicative, while my party will
derive very little advantage from anything I may tell him.” He therefore
took Ravenswood aside into the deep recess of a window in the hall, and
resuming the discourse of the proceeding evening, expressed a hope that
his young friend would assume some patience, in order to hear him enter
in a minute and explanatory detail of those unfortunate circumstances
in which his late honourable father had stood at variance with the Lord
Keeper. The Master of Ravenswood coloured highly, but was silent; and
the Lord Keeper, though not greatly approving the sudden heightening
of his auditor’s complexion, commenced the history of a bond for twenty
thousand merks, advanced by his father to the father of Allan Lord
Ravenswood, and was proceeding to detail the executorial proceedings
by which this large sum had been rendered a debitum fundi, when he was
interrupted by the Master.

“It is not in this place,” he said, “that I can hear Sir William
Ashton’s explanation of the matters in question between us. It is not
here, where my father died of a broken heart, that I can with decency
or temper investigate the cause of his distress. I might remember that I
was a son, and forget the duties of a host. A time, however, there must
come, when these things shall be discussed, in a place and in a presence
where both of us will have equal freedom to speak and to hear.”

“Any time,” the Lord Keeper said, “any place, was alike to those who
sought nothing but justice. Yet it would seem he was, in fairness,
entitled to some premonition respecting the grounds upon which the
Master proposed to impugn the whole train of legal proceedings, which
had been so well and ripely advised in the only courts competent.”

“Sir William Ashton,” answered the Master, with warmth, “the lands which
you now occupy were granted to my remote ancestor for services done with
his sword against the English invaders. How they have glided from us by
a train of proceedings that seem to be neither sale, nor mortgage, nor
adjudication for debt, but a nondescript and entangled mixture of all
these rights; how annual rent has been accumulated upon principal, and
no nook or coign of legal advantage left unoccupied, until our interest
in our hereditary property seems to have melted away like an icicle in
thaw--all this you understand better than I do. I am willing, however,
to suppose, from the frankness of your conduct towards me, that I may in
a great measure have mistaken your personal character, and that things
may have appeared right and fitting to you, a skilful and practised
lawyer, which to my ignorant understanding seem very little short of
injustice and gross oppression.”

“And you, my dear Master,” answered Sir William--“you, permit me to say,
have been equally misrepresented to me. I was taught to believe you
a fierce, imperious, hot-headed youth, ready, at the slightest
provocation, to throw your sword into the scales of justice, and to
appeal to those rude and forcible measures from which civil polity has
long protected the people of Scotland. Then, since we were mutually
mistaken in each other, why should not the young nobleman be willing
to listen to the old lawyer, while, at least, he explains the points of
difference betwixt them?”

“No, my lord,” answered Ravenswood; “it is in the House of British
Peers, whose honour must be equal to their rank--it is in the court of
last resort that we must parley together. The belted lords of Britain,
her ancient peers, must decide, if it is their will that a house,
not the least noble of their members, shall be stripped of their
possessions, the reward of the patriotism of generations, as the pawn of
a wretched mechanic becomes forfeit to the usurer the instant the hour
of redemption has passed away. If they yield to the grasping severity of
the creditor, and to the gnawing usury that eats into our lands as moths
into a raiment, it will be of more evil consequence to them and their
posterity than to Edgar Ravenswood. I shall still have my sword and my
cloak, and can follow the profession of arms wherever a trumpet shall
sound.”

As he pronounced these words, in a firm yet melancholy tone, he raised
his eyes, and suddenly encountered those of Lucy Ashton, who had stolen
unawares on their interview, and observed her looks fastened on them
with an expression of enthusiastic interest and admiration, which had
wrapt her for the moment beyond the fear of discovery. The noble form
and fine features of Ravenswood, fired with the pride of birth and sense
of internal dignity, the mellow and expressive tones of his voice,
the desolate state of his fortunes, and the indifference with which he
seemed to endure and to dare the worst that might befall, rendered him a
dangerous object of contemplation for a maiden already too much
disposed to dwell upon recollections connected with him. When their eyes
encountered each other, both blushed deeply, conscious of some strong
internal emotion, an shunned again to meet each other’s looks. Sir
William Ashton had, of course, closely watched the expression of their
countenances. “I need fear,” said he internally, “neither Parliament nor
protestation; I have an effectual mode of reconciling myself with this
hot-tempered young fellow, in case he shall become formidable. The
present object is, at all events, to avoid committing ourselves. The
hook is fixed; we will nto strain the line too soon: it is as well to
reserve the privilege of slipping it loose, if we do not find the fish
worth landing.”

In this selfish and cruel calculation upon the supposed attachment of
Ravenswood to Lucy, he was so far from considering the pain he might
give to the former, by thus dallying with his affections, that he even
did not think upon the risk of involving his own daughter in the perils
of an unfortunate passion; as if her predilection, which could not
escape his attention, were like the flame of a taper which might be
lighted or extinguished at pleasure. But Providence had prepared a
dreadful requital for this keen observer of human passions, who had
spent his life in securing advantages to himself by artfully working
upon the passions of others.

Caleb Balderstone now came to announce that breakfast was prepared; for
in those days of substantial feeding, the relics of the supper simply
furnished forth the morning meal. Neither did he forget to present to
the Lord Keeper, with great reverence, a morning draught in a large
pewter cup, garnished with leaves of parsley and scurvy-grass. He craved
pardon, of course, for having omitted to serve it in the great silver
standing cup as behoved, being that it was at present in a silversmith’s
in Edinburgh, for the purpose of being overlaid with gilt.

“In Edinburgh like enough,” said Ravenswood; “but in what place, or for
what purpose, I am afraid neither you nor I know.”

“Aweel!” said Caleb, peevishly, “there’s a man standing at the gate
already this morning--that’s ae thing that I ken. Does your honour ken
whether ye will speak wi’ him or no?”

“Does he wish to speak with me, Caleb?”

“Less will no serve him,” said Caleb; “but ye had best take a visie of
him through the wicket before opening the gate; it’s no every ane we
suld let into this castle.”

“What! do you suppose him to be a messenger come to arrest me for debt?”
 said Ravenswood.

“A messenger arrest your honour for debt, and in your Castle of Wolf’s
Crag! Your honour is jesting wi’ auld Caleb this morning.” However, he
whispered in his ear, as he followed him out, “I would be loth to do ony
decent man a prejudice in your honour’s gude opinion; but I would tak
twa looks o’ that chield before I let him within these walls.”

He was not an officer of the law, however; being no less a person than
Captain Craigengelt, with his nose as red as a comfortable cup of brandy
could make it, his laced cocked hat set a little aside upon the top
of his black riding periwig, a sword by his side and pistols at his
holsters, and his person arrayed in a riding suit, laid over with
tarnished lace--the very moral of one who would say, “Stand to a true
man.”

When the Master had recognised him, he ordered the gates to be opened.
“I suppose,” he said, “Captain Craigengelt, there are no such weighty
matters betwixt you and me, but may be discussed in this place. I have
company in the castle at present, and the terms upon which we last
parted must excuse my asking you to make part of them.”

Craigengelt, although possessing the very perfection of impudence, was
somewhat abashed by this unfavourable reception. “He had no intention,”
 he said, “to force himself upon the Master of Ravenswood’s hospitality;
he was in the honourable service of bearing a message to him from a
friend, otherwise the Master of Ravenswood should not have had reason to
complain of this intrusion.”

“Let it be short, sir,” said the Master, “for that will be the best
apology. Who is the gentleman who is so fortunate as to have your
services as a messenger?”

“My friend, Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” answered Craigengelt, with
conscious importance, and that confidence which the acknowledged courage
of his principal inspired, “who conceives himself to have been treated
by you with something much short of the respect which he had reason to
demand, and, therefore is resolved to exact satisfaction. I bring with
me,” said he, taking a piece of paper out of his pocket, “the precise
length of his sword; and he requests you will meet him, accompanied by
a friend, and equally armed, at any place within a mile of the castle,
when I shall give attendance as umpire, or second, on his behoof.”

“Satisfaction! and equal arms!” repeated Ravenswood, who, the reader
will recollect, had no reason to suppose he had given the slightest
offence to his late intimate; “upon my word, Captain Craigengelt, either
you have invented the most improbable falsehood that ever came into the
mind of such a person, or your morning draught has been somewhat of the
strongest. What could persuade Bucklaw to send me such a message?”

“For that, sir,” replied Craigengelt, “I am desired to refer you to
what, in duty to my friend, I am to term your inhospitality in excluding
him from your house, without reasons assigned.”

“It is impossible,” replied the Master; “he cannot be such a fool as to
interpret actual necessity as an insult. Nor do I believe that, knowing
my opinion of you, Captain, he would have employed the services of so
slight and inconsiderable a person as yourself upon such an errand, as I
certainly could expect no man of honour to act with you in the office of
umpire.”

“I slight and inconsiderable?” said Craigengelt, raising his voice, and
laying his hand on his cutlass; “if it were not that the quarrel of
my friend craves the precedence, and is in dependence before my own, I
would give you to understand----”

“I can understand nothing upon your explanation, Captain Craigengelt. Be
satisfied of that, and oblige me with your departure.”

“D----n!” muttered the bully; “and is this the answer which I am to
carry back to an honourable message?”

“Tell the Laird of Bucklaw,” answered Ravenswood, “if you are really
sent by him, that, when he sends me his cause of grievance by a person
fitting to carry such an errand betwixt him and me, I will either
explain it or maintain it.”

“Then, Master, you will at least cause to be returned to Hayston, by my
hands, his property which is remaining in your possession.”

“Whatever property Bucklaw may have left behind him, sir,” replied the
Master, “shall be returned to him by my servant, as you do not show me
any credentials from him which entitle you to receive it.”

“Well, Master,” said Captain Craigengelt, with malice which even his
fear of the consequences could not suppress, “you have this morning done
me an egregious wrong adn dishonour, but far more to yourself. A castle
indeed!” he continued, looking around him; “why, this is worse than
a coupe-gorge house, where they receive travellers to plunder them of
their property.”

“You insolent rascal,” said the Master, raising his cane, and making a
grasp at the Captain’s bridle, “if you do not depart without uttering
another syllable, I will batoon you to death!”

At the motion of the Master towards him, the bully turned so rapidly
round, that with some difficulty he escaped throwing down his horse,
whose hoofs struck fire from the rocky pavement in every direction.
Recovering him, however, with the bridle, he pushed for the gate, and
rode sharply back again in the direction of the village.

As Ravenswood turned round to leave the courtyard after this dialogue,
he found that the Lord Keeper had descended from the hall, and
witnessed, though at the distance prescribed by politeness, his
interview with Craigengelt.

“I have seen,” said the Lord Keeper, “that gentleman’s face, and at no
great distance of time; his name is Craig--Craig--something, is it not?”

“Craigengelt is the fellow’s name,” said the Master, “at least that by
which he passes at present.”

“Craig-in-guilt,” said Caleb, punning upon the word “craig,” which in
Scotch signifies throat; “if he is Craig-in-guilt just now, he is as
likely to be Craig-in-peril as ony chield I ever saw; the loon has
woodie written on his very visnomy, and I wad wager twa and a plack that
hemp plaits his cravat yet.”

“You understand physiognomy, good Mr. Caleb,” said the Keeper, smiling;
“I assure you the gentleman has been near such a consummation before
now; for I most distinctly recollect that, upon occasion of a journey
which I made about a fortnight ago to Edinburgh, I saw Mr. Craigengelt,
or whatever is his name, undergo a severe examination before the privy
council.”

“Upon what account?” said the Master of Ravenswood, with some interest.

The question led immediately to a tale which the Lord Keeper had been
very anxious to introduce, when he could find a graceful and fitting
opportunity. He took hold of the Master’s arm, and led him back towards
the hall. “The answer to your question,” he said, “though it is a
ridiculous business, is only fit for your own ear.”

As they entered the hall, he again took the Master apart into one of
the recesses of the window, where it will be easily believed that Miss
Ashton did not venture again to intrude upon their conference.




CHAPTER XVII.

     Here is a father now,
     Will truck his daughter for a foreign venture,
     Make her the stop-gap to some canker’d feud,
     Or fling her o’er, like Jonah, to the fishes,
     To appease the sea at highest.

     Anonymous.

THE Lord Keeper opened his discourse with an appearance of unconcern,
marking, however, very carefully, the effect of his communication upon
young Ravenswood.

“You are aware,” he said, “my young friend, that suspicion is the
natural vice of our unsettled times, and exposes the best and wisest of
us to the imposition of artful rascals. If I had been disposed to listen
to such the other day, or even if I had been the wily politicians which
you have been taught to believe me, you, Master of Ravenswood, instead
of being at freedom, and with fully liberty to solicit and act against
me as you please, in defence of what you suppose to be your rights,
would have been in the Castle of Edinburgh, or some other state prison;
or, if you had escaped that destiny, it must have been by flight to a
foreign country, and at the risk of a sentence of fugitation.”

“My Lord Keeper,” said the Master, “I think you would not jest on such a
subject; yet it seems impossible you can be in earnest.”

“Innocence,” said the Lord Keeper, “is also confident, and sometimes,
though very excusably, presumptuously so.”

“I do not understand,” said Ravenswood, “how a consciousess of innocence
can be, in any case, accounted presumptuous.”

“Imprudent, at least, it may be called,” said Sir William Ashton, “since
it is apt to lead us into the mistake of supposing that sufficiently
evident to others of which, in fact, we are only conscious ourselves. I
have known a rogue, for this very reason, make a better defence than
an innocent man could have done in the same circumstances of suspicion.
Having no consciousness of innocence to support him, such a fellow
applies himself to all the advantages which the law will afford him, and
sometimes--if his counsel be men of talent--succeeds in compelling his
judges to receive him as innocent. I remember the celebrated case of Sir
Coolie Condiddle of Condiddle, who was tried for theft under trust, of
which all the world knew him guilty, and yet was not only acquitted, but
lived to sit in judgment on honester folk.”

“Allow me to beg you will return to the point,” said the Master; “you
seemed to say that I had suffered under some suspicion.”

“Suspicion, Master! Ay, truly, and I can show you the proofs of it; if
I happen only to have them with me. Here, Lockhard.” His attendant came.
“Fetch me the little private mail with the padlocks, that I recommended
to your particular charge, d’ye hear?”

“Yes, my lord.” Lockhard vanished; and the Keeper continued, as if half
speaking to himself.

“I think the papers are with me--I think so, for, as I was to be in
this country, it was natural for me to bring them with me. I have them,
however, at Ravenswood Castle, that I am sure; so perhaps you might
condescend----”

Here Lockhard entered, and put the leathern scrutoire, or mail-box,
into his hands. The Keeper produced one or two papers, respecting the
information laid before the privy council concerning the riot, as it was
termed, at the funeral of Allan Lord Ravenswood, and the active share he
had himself taken in quashing the proceedings against the Master. These
documents had been selected with care, so as to irritate the natural
curiosity of Ravenswood upon such a subject, without gratifying it, yet
to show that Sir William Ashton had acted upon that trying occasion
the part of an advocate and peacemaker betwixt him and the jealous
authorities of the day. Having furnished his host with such subjects for
examination, the Lord Keeper went to the breakfast-table, and entered
into light conversation, addressed partly to old Caleb, whose resentment
against the usurper of the Castle of Ravenswood began to be softened by
his familiarity, and partly to his daughter.

After perusing these papers, the Master of Ravenswood remained for
a minute or two with his hand pressed against his brow, in deep and
profound meditation. He then again ran his eye hastily over the papers,
as if desirous of discovering in them some deep purpose, or some mark
of fabrication, which had escaped him at first perusal. Apparently the
second reading confirmed the opinion which had pressed upon him at the
first, for he started from the stone bench on which he was sitting,
and, going to the Lord Keeper, took his hand, and, strongly pressing it,
asked his pardon repeatedly for the injustice he had done him, when it
appeared he was experiencing, at his hands, the benefit of protection to
his person and vindication to his character.

The statesman received these acknowledgments at first with well-feigned
surprise, and then with an affectation of frank cordiality. The tears
began already to start from Lucy’s blue eyes at viewing this unexpected
and moving scene. To see the Master, late so haughty and reserved, and
whom she had always supposed the injured person, supplicating her
father for forgiveness, was a change at once surprising, flattering, and
affecting.

“Dry your eyes, Lucy,” said her father; “why should you weep, because
your father, though a lawyer, is discovered to be a fair and honourable
man? What have you to thank me for, my dear Master,” he continued,
addressing Ravenswood, “that you would not have done in my case? ‘Suum
cuique tribuito,’ was the Roman justice, and I learned it when I studied
Justinian. Besides, have you not overpaid me a thousand times, in saving
the life of this dear child?”

“Yes,” answered the Master, in all the remorse of self-accusation; “but
the little service _I_ did was an act of mere brutal instinct; YOUR
defence of my cause, when you knew how ill I thought of you, and how
much I was disposed to be your enemy, was an act of generous, manly, and
considerate wisdom.”

“Pshaw!” said the Lord Keeper, “each of us acted in his own way; you as
a gallant soldier, I as an upright judge and privy-councillor. We could
not, perhaps, have changed parts; at least I should have made a very
sorry tauridor, and you, my good Master, though your cause is so
excellent, might have pleaded it perhaps worse yourself than I who acted
for you before the council.”

“My generous friend!” said Ravenswood; and with that brief word,
which the Keeper had often lavished upon him, but which he himself now
pronounced for the first time, he gave to his feudal enemy the full
confidence of an haughty but honourable heart. The Master had been
remarked among his contemporaries for sense and acuteness, as well
as for his reserved, pertinacious, and irascible character. His
prepossessions accordingly, however obstinate, were of a nature to give
way before love and gratitude; and the real charms of the daughter,
joined to the supposed services of the father, cancelled in his memory
the vows of vengeance which he had taken so deeply on the eve of his
father’s funeral. But they had been heard and registered in the book of
fate.

Caleb was present at this extraordinary scene, and he could conceive no
other reason for a proceeding so extraordinary than an alliance betwixt
the houses, and Ravenswood Castle assigned for the young lady’s dowry.
As for Lucy, when Ravenswood uttered the most passionate excuses for his
ungrateful negligence, she could but smile through her tears, and, as
she abandoned her hand to him, assure him, in broken accents, of the
delight with which she beheld the complete reconciliation between her
father and her deliverer. Even the statesman was moved and affected
by the fiery, unreserved, and generous self-abandonment with which the
Master of Ravenswood renounced his feudal enmity, and threw himself
without hesitation upon his forgiveness. His eyes glistened as he looked
upon a couple who were obviously becoming attached, and who seemed made
for each other. He thought how high the proud and chivalrous character
of Ravenswood might rise under many circumstances in which HE found
himself “overcrowed,” to use a phrase of Spenser, and kept under, by
his brief pedigree, and timidity of disposition. Then his daughter--his
favorite child--his constant playmate--seemed formed to live happy in
a union with such a commanding spirit as Ravenswood; and even the fine,
delicate, fragile form of Lucy Ashton seemed to require the support of
the Master’s muscular strength and masculine character. And it was not
merely during a few minutes that Sir William Ashton looked upon their
marriage as a probable and even desirable event, for a full hour
intervened ere his imagination was crossed by recollection of the
Master’s poverty, and the sure displeasure of Lady Ashton. It is
certain, that the very unusual flow of kindly feeling with which the
Lord Keeper had been thus surprised, was one of the circumstances which
gave much tacit encouragement to the attachment between the Master and
his daughter, and led both the lovers distinctly to believe that it
was a connexion which would be most agreeable to him. He himself
was supposed to have admitted this in effect, when, long after
the catastrophe of their love, he used to warn his hearers against
permitting their feelings to obtain an ascendency over their judgment,
and affirm, that the greatest misfortune of his life was owing to a
very temporary predominance of sensibility over self-interest. It must
be owned, if such was the case, he was long and severely punished for an
offence of very brief duration.

After some pause, the Lord Keeper resumed the conversation.--

“In your surprise at finding me an honester man than you expected, you
have lost your curiosity about this Craigengelt, my good Master; and yet
your name was brought in, in the course of that matter too.”

“The scoundrel!” said Ravenswood. “My connexion with him was of the
most temporary nature possible; and yet I was very foolish to hold any
communication with him at all. What did he say of me?”

“Enough,” said the Keeper, “to excite the very loyal terrors of some
of our sages, who are for proceeding against men on the mere grounds of
suspicion or mercenary information. Some nonsense about your proposing
to enter into the service of France, or of the Pretender, I don’t
recollect which, but which the Marquis of A----, one of your best
friends, and another person, whom some call one of your worst and most
interested enemies, could not, somehow, be brought to listen to.”

“I am obliged to my honourable friend; and yet,” shaking the Lord
Keeper’s hand--“and yet I am still more obliged to my honourable enemy.”

“Inimicus amicissimus,” said the Lord Keeper, returning the pressure;
“but this gentleman--this Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw--I am afraid the
poor young man--I heard the fellow mention his name--is under very bad
guidance.”

“He is old enough to govern himself,” answered the Master.

“Old enough, perhaps, but scarce wise enough, if he has chosen this
fellow for his fidus Achates. Why, he lodged an information against
him--that is, such a consequence might have ensued from his examination,
had we not looked rather at the character of the witness than the tenor
of his evidence.”

“Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw,” said the master, “is, I believe, a most
honourable man, and capable of nothing that is mean or disgraceful.”

“Capable of much that is unreasonable, though; that you must needs
allow, master. Death will soon put him in possession of a fair estate,
if he hath it not already; old Lady Girnington--an excellent person,
excepting that her inveterate ill-nature rendered her intolerable to the
whole world--is probably dead by this time. Six heirs portioners have
successively died to make her wealthy. I know the estates well; they
march with my own--a noble property.”

“I am glad of it,” said Ravenswood, “and should be more so, were I
confident that Bucklaw would change his company and habits with his
fortunes. This appearance of Craigengelt, acting in the capacity of his
friend, is a most vile augury for his future respectability.”

“He is a bird of evil omen, to be sure,” said the Keeper, “and croaks
of jail and gallows-tree. But I see Mr. Caleb grows impatient for our
return to breakfast.”




CHAPTER XVIII.

     Sir, stay at home and take an old man’s counsel;
     Seek not to bask you by a stranger’s hearth;
     Our own blue smoke is warmer than their fire.
     Domestic food is wholesome, though ‘tis homely,
     And foreign dainties poisonous, though tasteful.

     The French Courtezan.

THE Master of Ravenswood took an opportunity to leave his guests
to prepare for their departure, while he himself made the brief
arrangements necessary previous to his absence from Wolf’s Crag for a
day or two. It was necessary to communicate with Caleb on this occasion,
and he found that faithful servitor in his sooty and ruinous den,
greatly delighted with the departure of their visitors, and computing
how long, with good management, the provisions which had been unexpended
might furnish the Master’s table. “He’s nae belly god, that’s ae
blessing; and Bucklaw’s gane, that could have eaten a horse behind
the saddle. Cresses or water-purpie, and a bit ait-cake, can serve
the Master for breakfast as weel as Caleb. Then for dinner--there’s no
muckle left on the spule-bane; it will brander, though--it will brander
very weel.”

His triumphant calculations were interrupted by the Master, who
communicated to him, not without some hesitation, his purpose to ride
with the Lord Keeper as far as Ravenswood Castle, and to remain there
for a day or two.

“The mercy of Heaven forbid!” said the old serving-man, turning as pal
as the table-cloth which he was folding up.

“And why, Caleb?” said his master--“why should the mercy of Heaven
forbid my returning the Lord Keeper’s visit?”

“Oh, sir!” replied Caleb--“oh, Mr. Edgar! I am your servant, and it ill
becomes me to speak; but I am an auld servant--have served baith
your father and gudesire, and mind to have seen Lord Randal, your
great-grandfather, but that was when I was a bairn.”

“And what of all this, Balderstone?” said the Master; “what can
it possibly have to do with my paying some ordinary civility to a
neighbour.”

“Oh, Mr. Edgar,--that is, my lord!” answered the butler, “your ain
conscience tells you it isna for your father’s son to be neighbouring
wi’ the like o’ him; it isna for the credit of the family. An he were
ance come to terms, and to gie ye back your ain, e’en though ye suld
honour his house wi’ your alliance, I suldna say na; for the young leddy
is a winsome sweet creature. But keep your ain state wi’ them--I ken the
race o’ them weel--they will think the mair o’ ye.”

“Why, now, you go father than I do, Caleb,” said the Master, drowning a
certain degree of consciousness in a forced laugh; “you are for marrying
me into a family that you will nto allow me to visit, how this? and you
look as pale as death besides.”

“Oh, sir,” repeated Caleb again, “you would but laugh if I tauld it; but
Thomas the Rhymer, whose tongue couldna be fause, spoke the word of your
house that will e’en prove ower true if you go to Ravenswood this day.
Oh, that it should e’er have been fulfilled in my time!”

“And what is it, Caleb?” said Ravenswood, wishing to soothe the fears of
his old servant.

Caleb replied: “He had never repeated the lines to living mortal; they
were told to him by an auld priest that had been confessor to Lord
Allan’s father when the family were Catholic. But mony a time,” he said,
“I hae soughed thae dark words ower to myself, and, well-a-day! little
did I think of their coming round this day.”

“Truce with your nonsense, and let me hear the doggerel which has put it
into your head,” said the Master, impatiently.

With a quivering voice, and a cheek pale with apprehension, Caleb
faltered out the following lines:

“When the last Laird of Ravenswood to Ravenswood shall ride, And woo a
dead maiden to be his bride, He shall stable his steed in the Kelpie’s
flow, And his name shall be lost for evermoe!”

“I know the Kelpie’s flow well enough,” said the Master; “I suppose, at
least, you mean the quicksand betwixt this tower and Wolf’s Hope; but
why any man in his senses should stable a steed there----”

“Oh, ever speer ony thing about that, sir--God forbid we should ken what
the prophecy means--but just bide you at hame, and let the strangers
ride to Ravenswood by themselves. We have done eneugh for them; and
to do mair would be mair against the credit of the family than in its
favour.”

“Well, Caleb,” said the Master, “I give you the best possible credit for
your good advice on this occasion; but as I do not go to Ravenswood to
seek a bride, dead or alive, I hope I shall choose a better stable for
my horse than the Kelpie’s quicksand, and especially as I have always
had a particular dread of it since the patrol of dragoons were
lost there ten years since. My father and I saw them from the tower
struggling against the advancing tide, and they were lost long before
any help could reach them.”

“And they deserved it weel, the southern loons!” said Caleb; “what had
they ado capering on our sands, and hindering a wheen honest folk frae
bringing on shore a drap brandy? I hae seen them that busy, that I
wad hae fired the auld culverin or the demi-saker that’s on the south
bartizan at them, only I was feared they might burst in the ganging
aff.”

Caleb’s brain was now fully engaged with abuse of the English soldiery
and excisemen, so that his master found no great difficulty in
escaping from him and rejoining his guests. All was now ready for
their departure; and one of the Lord Keeper’s grooms having saddled the
Master’s steed, they mounted in the courtyard.

Caleb had, with much toil, opened the double doors of the outward gate,
and thereat stationed himself, endeavouring, by the reverential, and at
the same time consequential, air which he assumed, to supply, by his
own gaunt, wasted, and thin person, the absence of a whole baronial
establishment of porters, warders, and liveried menials.

The Keeper returned his deep reverence with a cordial farewell, stooping
at the same time from his horse, and sliding into the butler’s hand the
remuneration which in those days was always given by a departing guest
to the domestics of the family where he had been entertained. Lucy
smiled on the old man with her usual sweetness, bade him adieu, and
deposited her guerdon with a grace of action and a gentleness of accent
which could not have failed to have won the faithful retainer’s heart,
but for Thomas the Rhymer, and the successful lawsuit against his
master. As it was, he might have adopted the language of the Duke in As
You Like It:

Thou wouldst have better pleased me with this deed, If thou hadst told
me of another father.

Ravenswood was at the lady’s bridle-rein, encouraging her timidity, and
guiding her horse carefully down the rocky path which led to the moor,
when one of the servants announced from the rear that Caleb was calling
loudly after them, desiring to speak with his master. Ravenswood felt it
would look singular to neglect this summons, although inwardly cursing
Caleb for his impertinent officiousness; therefore he was compelled to
relinquish to Mr. Lockhard the agreeable duty in which he was engaged,
and to ride back to the gate of the courtyard. Here he was beginning,
somewhat peevishly, to ask Caleb the cause of his clamour, when the good
old man exclaimed: “Whisht, sir!--whisht, and let me speak just ae word
that I couldna say afore folk; there (putting into his lord’s hand the
money he had just received)--there’s three gowd pieces; and ye’ll
want siller up-bye yonder. But stay, whisht, now!” for the Master was
beginning to exclaim against this transference, “never say a word, but
just see to get them changed in the first town ye ride through, for they
are bran new frae the mint, and ken-speckle a wee bit.”

“You forget, Caleb,” said his master, striving to force back the money
on his servant, and extricate the bridle from his hold--“you forget that
I have some gold pieces left of my own. Keep these to yourself, my old
friend; and, once more, good day to you. I assure you, I have plenty.
You know you have managed that our living should cost us little or
nothing.”

“Aweel,” said Caleb, “these will serve for you another time; but see ye
hae eneugh, for, doubtless, for the credit of the family, there maun be
some civility to the servants, and ye maun hae something to mak a show
with when they say, ‘Master, will you bet a broad piece?’ Then ye maun
tak out your purse, and say, ‘I carena if I do’; and tak care no to
agree on the articles of the wager, and just put up your purse again,
and----”

“This is intolerable, Caleb; I really must be gone.”

“And you will go, then?” said Caleb, loosening his hold upon the
Master’s cloak, and changing his didactics into a pathetic and mournful
tone--“and you WILL go, for a’ I have told you about the prophecy, and
the dead bride, and the Kelpie’s quicksand? Aweel! a wilful man maun
hae his way: he that will to Cupar maun to Cupar. But pity of your life,
sir, if ye be fowling or shooting in the Park, beware of drinking at the
Mermaiden’s Well--He’s gane! he’s down the path arrow-flight after her!
The head is as clean taen aff the Ravenswood family this day as I wad
chap the head aff a sybo!”

The old butler looked long after his master, often clearing away the dew
as it rose to his eyes, that he might, as long as possible, distinguish
his stately form from those of the other horsemen. “Close to her
bridle-rein--ay, close to her bridle-rein! Wisely saith the holy man,
‘By this also you may know that woman hath dominion over all men’; and
without this lass would not our ruin have been a’thegither fulfilled.”

With a heart fraught with such sad auguries did Caleb return to
his necessary duties at Wofl’s Crag, as soon as he could no longer
distinguish the object of his anxiety among the group of riders, which
diminished in the distance.

In the mean time the party pursued their route joyfully. Having once
taken his resolution, the Master of Ravenswood was not of a character to
hesitate or pause upon it. He abandoned himself to the pleasure he felt
in Miss Ashton’s company, and displayed an assiduous gallantry which
approached as nearly to gaiety as the temper of his mind and state of
his family permitted. The Lord Keeper was much struck with his depth of
observation, and the unusual improvement which he had derived from his
studies. Of these accomplishments Sir William Ashton’s profession and
habits of society rendered him an excellent judge; and he well knew how
to appreciate a quality to which he himself was a total stranger--the
brief and decided dauntlessness of the Master of Ravenswood’s fear. In
his heart the Lord Keeper rejoiced at having conciliated an adversary
so formidable, while, with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety, he
anticipated the great things his young companion might achieve, were the
breath of court-favour to fill his sails.

“What could she desire,” he thought, his mind always conjuring
up opposition in the person of Lady Ashton to his new prevailing
wish--“what could a woman desire in a match more than the sopiting of
a very dangerous claim, and the alliance of a son-in-law, noble, brave,
well-gifted, and highly connected; sure to float whenever the tide
sets his way; strong, exactly where we are weak, in pedigree and in the
temper of a swordsman? Sure, no reasonable woman would hesitate. But
alas----!” Here his argument was stopped by the consciousness that Lady
Ashton was not always reasonable, in his sense of the word. “To prefer
some clownish Merse laird to the gallant young nobleman, and to the
secure possession of Ravenswood upon terms of easy compromise--it would
be the act of a madwoman!”

Thus pondered the veteran politician, until they reached Bittlebrains
House, where it had been previously settled they were to dine and repose
themselves, and prosecute their journey in the afternoon.

They were received with an excess of hospitality; and the most marked
attention was offered to the Master of Ravenswood, in particular, by
their noble entertainers. The truth was, that Lord Bittlebrains had
obtained his peerage by a good deal of plausibility, an art of building
up a character for wisdom upon a very trite style of commonplace
eloquence, a steady observation of the changes of the times, and the
power of rendering certain political services to those who could best
reward them. His lady and he, not feeling quite easy under their new
honours, to which use had not adapted their feelings, were very desirous
to procure the fraternal countenance of those who were born denizens of
the regions into which they had been exalted from a lower sphere. The
extreme attention which they paid to the Master of Ravenswood had its
usual effect in exalting his importance in the eyes of the Lord
Keeper, who, although he had a reasonable degree of contempt for
Lord Bittlebrains’s general parts, entertained a high opinion of the
acuteness of his judgment in all matters of self-interest.

“I wish Lady Ashton had seen this,” was his internal reflection; “no man
knows so well as Bittlebrains on which side his bread is buttered; and
he fawns on the Master like a beggar’s messan on a cook. And my lady,
too, bringing forward her beetle-browed misses to skirl and play upon
the virginals, as if she said, ‘Pick and choose.’ They are no more
comparable to Lucy than an owl is to a cygnet, and so they may carry
their black brows to a farther market.”

The entertainment being ended, our travellers, who had still to measure
the longest part of their journey, resumed their horses; and after the
Lord Keeper, the Master, and the domestics had drunk doch-an-dorroch,
or the stirrup-cup, in the liquors adapted to their various ranks, the
cavalcade resumed its progress.

It was dark by the time they entered the avenue of Ravenswood Castle, a
long straight line leading directly to the front of the house, flanked
with huge elm-trees, which sighed to the night-wind, as if they
compassionated the heir of their ancient proprietors, who now returned
to their shades in the society, and almost in the retinue, of their new
master. Some feelings of the same kind oppressed the mind of the Master
himself. He gradually became silent, adn dropped a little behind the
lady, at whose bridle-rein he had hitherto waited with such devotion.
He well recollected the period when, at the same hour in the evening, he
had accompanied his father, as that nobleman left, never again to
return to it, the mansion from which he derived his name and title. The
extensive front of the old castle, on which he remembered having often
looked back, was then “as black as mourning weed.” The same front now
glanced with many lights, some throwing far forward into the night
a fixed and stationary blaze, and others hurrying from one window to
another, intimating the bustle and busy preparation preceding their
arrival, which had been intimated by an avant-courier. The contrast
pressed so strongly upon the Master’s heart as to awaken some of the
sterner feelings with which he had been accustomed to regard the new
lord of his paternal domain, and to impress his countenance with an air
of severe gravity, when, alighted from his horse, he stood in the hall
no longer his own, surrounded by the numerous menials of its present
owner.

The Lord Keeper, when about to welcome him with the cordiality which
their late intercourse seemed to render proper, became aware of the
change, refrained from his purpose, and only intimated the ceremony of
reception by a deep reverence to his guest, seeming thus delicately to
share the feelings which predominated on his brow.

Two upper domestics, bearing each a huge pair of silver candlesticks,
now marshalled the company into a large saloon, or withdrawing-room,
where new alterations impressed upon Ravenswood the superior wealth of
the present inhabitants of the castle. The mouldering tapestry, which,
in his father’s time, had half covered the walls of this stately
apartment, and half streamed from them in tatters, had given place to
a complete finishing of wainscot, the cornice of which, as well as the
frames of the various compartments, were ornamented with festoons of
flowers and with birds, which, though carved in oak, seemed, such was
the art of the chisel, actually to swell their throats and flutter their
wings. Several old family portraits of armed heroes of the house of
Ravenswood, together with a suit or two of old armour and some military
weapons, had given place to those of King William and Queen Mary, or
Sir Thomas Hope and Lord Stair, two distinguished Scottish lawyers. The
pictures of the Lord Keeper’s father and mother were also to be seen;
the latter, sour, shrewish, and solemn, in her black hood and close
pinners, with a book of devotion in her hand; the former, exhibiting
beneath a black silk Geneva cowl, or skull-cap, which sate as close to
the head as if it had been shaven, a pinched, peevish, Puritanical set
of features, terminating in a hungry, reddish, peaked beard, forming on
the whole a countenance in the expression of which the hypocrite seemed
to contend with the miser and the knave. “And it is to make room for
such scarecrows as these,” thought Ravenswood, “that my ancestors have
been torn down from the walls which they erected!” he looked at them
again, and, as he looked, the recollection of Lucy Ashton, for she
had not entered the apartment with them, seemed less lively in his
imagination. There were also two or three Dutch drolleries, as the
pictures of Ostade and Teniers were then termed, with one good painting
of the Italian school. There was, besides, a noble full-length of the
Lord Keeper in his robes of office, placed beside his lady in silk and
ermine, a haughty beauty, bearing in her looks all the pride of
the house of Douglas, from which she was descended. The painter,
notwithstanding his skill, overcome by the reality, or, perhaps, from a
suppressed sense of humour, had not been able to give the husband on the
canvas that air of awful rule and right supremacy which indicates the
full possession of domestic authority. It was obvious at the first
glance that, despite mace and gold frogs, the Lord Keeper was somewhat
henpecked. The floor of this fine saloon was laid with rich carpets,
huge fires blazed in the double chimneys, and ten silver sconces,
reflecting with their bright plates the lights which they supported,
made the whole seem as brilliant as day.

“Would you choose any refreshment, Master?” said Sir William Ashton, not
unwilling to break the awkward silence.

He received no answer, the Master being so busily engaged in marking the
various changes which had taken place in the apartment, that he
hardly heard the Lord Keeper address him. A repetition of the offer of
refreshment, with the addition, that the family meal would be presently
ready, compelled his attention, and reminded him that he acted a weak,
perhaps even a ridiculous, part in suffering himself to be overcome
by the circumstances in which he found himself. He compelled himself,
therefore, to enter into conversation with Sir William Ashton, with as
much appearance of indifference as he could well command.

“You will not be surprised, Sir William, that I am interested in the
changes you have made for the better in this apartment. In my father’s
time, after our misfortunes compelled him to live in retirement, it was
little used, except by me as a play-room, when the weather would not
permit me to go abroad. In that recess was my little workshop, where I
treasured the few carpenters’ tools which old Caleb procured for me,
and taught me how to use; there, in yonder corner, under that handsome
silver sconce, I kept my fishing-rods and hunting poles, bows and
arrows.”

“I have a young birkie,” said the Lord Keeper, willing to change the
tone of the conversation, “of much the same turn. He is never happy save
when he is in the field. I wonder he is not here. Here, Lockhard; send
William Shaw for Mr. Henry. I suppose he is, as usual, tied to Lucy’s
apron-string; that foolish girl, Master, draws the whole family after
her at her pleasure.”

Even this allusion to his daughter, though artfully thrown out, did not
recall Ravenswood from his own topic. “We were obliged to leave,” he
said, “some armour and portraits in this apartment; may I ask where they
have been removed to?”

“Why,” answered the Keeper, with some hesitation, “the room was fitted
up in our absence, and cedant arma togae is the maxim of lawyers, you
know: I am afraid it has been here somewhat too literally complied with.
I hope--I believe they are safe, I am sure I gave orders; may I hope
that when they are recovered, and put in proper order, you will do
me the honour to accept them at my hand, as an atonement for their
accidental derangement?”

The Master of Ravenswood bowed stiffly, and, with folded arms, again
resumed his survey of the room.

Henry, a spoilt boy of fifteen, burst into the room, and ran up to
his father. “Think of Lucy, papa; she has come home so cross and so
fractious, that she will not go down to the stable to see my new pony,
that Bob Wilson brought from the Mull of Galloway.”

“I think you were very unreasonable to ask her,” said the Keeper.

“Then you are as cross as she is,” answered the boy; “but when mamma
comes home, she’ll claw up both your mittens.”

“Hush your impertinence, you little forward imp!” said his father;
“where is your tutor?”

“Gone to a wedding at Dunbar; I hope he’ll get a haggis to his dinner”;
and he began to sing the old Scottish song:

“There was a haggis in Dunbar, Fal de ral, etc. Mony better and few
waur, Fal de ral,” etc.

“I am much obliged to Mr. Cordery for his attentions,” said the Lord
Keeper; “and pray who has had the charge of you while I was away, Mr.
Henry?”

“Norman and Bob Wilson, forbye my own self.”

“A groom and a gamekeeper, and your own silly self--proper guardians
for a young advocate! Why, you will never know any statutes but those
against shooting red-deer, killing salmon, and----”

“And speaking of red-game,” said the young scapegrace, interrupting his
father without scruple or hesitation, “Norman has shot a buck, and I
showed the branches to Lucy, and she says they have but eight tynes; and
she says that you killed a deer with Lord Bittlebrains’s hounds, when
you were west away, and, do you know, she says it had ten tynes; is it
true?”

“It may have had twenty, Henry, for what I know; but if you go to that
gentleman, he can tell you all about it. Go speak to him, Henry; it is
the Master of Ravenswood.”

While they conversed thus, the father and son were standing by the fire;
and the Master, having walked towards the upper end of the apartment,
stood with his back towards them, apparently engaged in examining one of
the paintings. The boy ran up to him, and pulled him by the skirt of
the coat with the freedom of a spoilt child, saying, “I say, sir, if you
please to tell me----” but when the Master turned round, and Henry saw
his face, he became suddenly and totally disconcerted; walked two or
three steps backward, and still gazed on Ravenswood with an air of fear
and wonder, which had totally banished from his features their usual
expression of pert vivacity.

“Come to me, young gentleman,” said the Master, “and I will tell you all
I know about the hunt.”

“Go to the gentleman, Henry,” said his father; “you are not used to be
so shy.”

But neither invitation nor exhortation had any effect on the boy. On the
contrary, he turned round as soon as he had completed his survey of the
Master, and walking as cautiously as if he had been treading upon eggs,
he glided back to his father, and pressed as close to him as possible.
Ravenswood, to avoid hearing the dispute betwixt the father and the
overindulged boy, thought it most polite to turn his face once more
towards the pictures, and pay no attention to what they said.

“Why do you not speak to the Master, you little fool?” said the Lord
Keeper.

“I am afraid,” said Henry, in a very low tone of voice.

“Afraid, you goose!” said his father, giving him a slight shake by the
collar. “What makes you afraid?”

“What makes him to like the picture of Sir Malise Ravenswood then?” said
the boy, whispering.

“What picture, you natural?” said his father. “I used to think you only
a scapegrace, but I believe you will turn out a born idiot.”

“I tell you, it is the picture of old Malise of Ravenswood, and he is as
like it as if he had loupen out of the canvas; and it is up in the old
baron’s hall that the maids launder the clothes in; and it has armour,
and not a coat like the gentleman; and he has not a beard and whiskers
like the picture; and it has another kind of thing about the throat, and
no band-strings as he has; and----”

“And why should not the gentleman be like his ancestor, you silly boy?”
 said the Lord Keeper.

“Ay; but if he is come to chase us all out of the castle,” said the boy,
“and has twenty men at his back in disguise; and is come to say, with
a hollow voice, ‘I bide my time’; and is to kill you on the hearth as
Malise did the other man, and whose blood is still to be seen!”

“Hush! nonsense!” said the Lord Keeper, not himself much pleased to hear
these disagreeable coincidences forced on his notice. “Master, here comes
Lockhard to say supper is served.”

And, at the same instant, Lucy entered at another door, having changed
her dress since her return. The exquisite feminine beauty of her
countenance, now shaded only by a profusion of sunny tresses; the
sylph-like form, disencumbered of her heavy riding-skirt and mantled in
azure silk; the grace of her manner and of her smile, cleared, with
a celerity which surprised the Master himself, all the gloomy and
unfavourable thoughts which had for some time overclouded his fancy.
In those features, so simply sweet, he could trace no alliance with
the pinched visage of the peak-bearded, black-capped Puritan, or his
starched, withered spouse, with the craft expressed in the Lord Keeper’s
countenance, or the haughtiness which predominated in that of his lady;
and, while he gazed on Lucy Ashton, she seemed to be an angel descended
on earth, unallied to the coarses mortals among whom she deigned to
dwell for a season. Such is the power of beauty over a youthful and
enthusiastic fancy.




CHAPTER XIX.

     I do too ill in this,
     And must not think but that a parent’s plaint
     Will move the heavens to pour forth misery
     Upon the head of disobediency.
     Yet reason tells us, parents are o’erseen,
     When with too strict a rein they do hold in
     Their child’s affection, and control that love,
     Which the high powers divine inspire them with.

     The Hog hath lost his Pearl.


THE feast of Ravenswood Castle was as remarkable for its profusion as
that of Wolf’s Crag had been for its ill-veiled penury. The Lord Keeper
might feel internal pride at the contrast, but he had too much tact
to suffer it to appear. On the contrary, he seemed to remember with
pleasure what he called Mr. Balderstone’s bachelor’s meal, and to be
rather disgusted than pleaseed with the display upon his own groaning
board.

“We do these things,” he said, “because others do them; but I was bred
a plain man at my father’s frugal table, and I should like well would
my wife and family permit me to return to my sowens and my
poor-man-of-mutton.”

This was a little overstretched. The Master only answered, “That
different ranks--I mean,” said he, correcting himself, “different
degrees of wealth require a different style of housekeeping.”

This dry remark put a stop to further conversation on the subject, nor
is it necessary to record that which was substituted in its place. The
evening was spent with freedom, and even cordiality; and Henry had so
far overcome his first apprehensions, that he had settled a party for
coursing a stag with the representative and living resemblance of grim
Sir Malise of Ravenswood, called the Revenger. The next morning was the
appointed time. It rose upon active sportsmen and successful sport. The
banquet came in course; and a pressing invitation to tarry yet another
day was given and accepted. This Ravenswood had resolved should be the
last of his stay; but he recollected he had not yet visited the ancient
and devoted servant of his house, Old Alice, and it was but kind to
dedicate one morning to the gratification of so ancient an adherent.

To visit Alice, therefore, a day was devoted, and Lucy was the Master’s
guide upon the way. Henry, it is true, accompanied them, and took from
their walk the air of a tete-a-tete, while, in reality, it was little
else, considering the variety of circumstances which occurred to prevent
the boy from giving the least attention to what passed between his
companions. Now a rook settled on a branch within shot; anon a hare
crossed their path, and Henry and his greyhound went astray in pursuit
of it; then he had to hold a long conversation with the forester, which
detained him a while behind his companions; and again he went to examine
the earth of a badger, which carried him on a good way before them.

The conversation betwixt the Master and his sister, meanwhile, took
an interesting, and almost a confidential, turn. She could not help
mentioning her sense of the pain he must feel in visiting scenes so well
known to him, bearing now an aspect so different; and so gently was
her sympathy expressed, that Ravenswood felt it for a moment as a full
requital of all his misfortunes. Some such sentiment escaped him, which
Lucy heard with more of confusion than displeasure; and she may be
forgiven the imprudence of listening to such language, considering that
the situation in which she was placed by her father seemed to authorise
Ravenswood to use it. Yet she made an effort to turn the conversation,
and she succeeded; for the Master also had advanced farther than he
intended, and his conscience had instantly checked him when he found
himself on the verge of speaking of love to the daughter of Sir William
Ashton.

They now approached the hut of Old Alice, which had of late been
rendered more comfortable, and presented an appearance less picturesque,
perhaps, but far neater than before. The old woman was on her accustomed
seat beneath the weeping birch, basking, with the listless enjoyment of
age and infirmity, in the beams of the autumn sun. At the arrival of
her visitors she turned her head towards them. “I hear your step, Miss
Ashton,” she said, “but the gentleman who attends you is not my lord,
your father.”

“And why should you think so, Alice?” said Lucy; “or how is it possible
for you to judge so accurately by the sound of a step, on this firm
earth, and in the open air?”

“My hearing, my child, has been sharpened by my blindness, and I can now
draw conclusions from the slightest sounds, which formerly reached my
ears as unheeded as they now approach yours. Necessity is a stern but an
excellent schoolmistress, and she that has lost her sight must collect
her information from other sources.”

“Well, you hear a man’s step, I grant it,” said Lucy; “but why, Alice,
may it not be my father’s?”

“The pace of age, my love, is timid and cautious: the foot takes leave
of the earth slowly, and is planted down upon it with hesitation; it
is the hasty and determined step of youth that I now hear, and--could I
give credit to so strange a thought--I should say is was the step of a
Ravenswood.”

“This is indeed,” said Ravenswood, “an acuteness of organ which I could
not have credited had I not witnessed it. I am indeed the Master of
Ravenswood, Alice,--the son of your old master.”

“You!” said the old woman, with almost a scream of surprise--“you the
Master of Ravenswood--here--in this place, and thus accompanied! I
cannot believe it. Let me pass my old hand over your face, that my touch
may bear witness to my ears.”

The Master sate down beside her on the earthen bank, and permitted her
to touch his features with her trembling hand.

“It is indeed!” she said--“it is the features as well as the voice of
Ravenswood--the high lines of pride, as well as the bold and haughty
tone. But what do you here, Master of Ravenswood?--what do you in your
enemy’s domain, and in company with his child?” As Old Alice spoke, her
face kindled, as probably that of an ancient feudal vassal might have
done in whose presence his youthful liege-lord had showed some symptom
of degenerating from the spirit of his ancestors.

“The Master of Ravenswood,” said Lucy, who liked not the tone of this
expostulation, and was desirous to abridge it, “is upon a visit to my
father.”

“Indeed!” said the old blind woman, in an accent of surprise.

“I knew,” continued Lucy, “I should do him a pleasure by conducting him
to your cottage.”

“Where, to say the truth, Alice,” said Ravenswood, “I expected a more
cordial reception.”

“It is most wonderful!” said the old woman, muttering to herself; “but
the ways of Heaven are not like our ways, and its judgments are brought
about by means far beyond our fathoming. Hearken, young man,” she said;
“your fathers were implacable, but they were honourable, foes; they
sought not to ruin their enemies under the mask of hospitality. What
have you to do with Lucy Ashton? why should your steps move in the same
footpath with hers? why should your voice sound in the same chord and
time with those of Sir William Ashton’s daughter? Young man, he who aims
at revenge by dishonourable means----”

“Be silent, woman!” said Ravenswood, sternly; “it is the devil that
prompts your voice? Know that this young lady has not on earth a friend
who would venture farther to save her from injury or from insult.”

“And is it even so?” said the old woman, in an altered but melancholy
tone, “then God help you both!”

“Amen! Alice,” said Lucy, who had not comprehended the import of what
the blind woman had hinted, “and send you your senses, Alice, and your
good humour. If you hold this mysterious language, instead of welcoming
your friends, they will think of you as other people do.”

“And how do other people think?” said Ravenswood, for he also began to
believe the old woman spoke with incoherence.

“They think,” said Henry Ashton, who came up at that moment, and
whispered into Ravenswood’s ear, “that she is a witch, that should have
been burned with them that suffered at Haddington.”

“What is it you say?” said Alice, turning towards the boy, her sightless
visage inflamed with passion; “that I am a witch, and ought to
have suffered with the helpless old wretches who were murdered at
Haddington?”

“Hear to that now,” again whispered Henry, “and me whispering lower than
a wren cheeps!”

“If the usurer, and the oppressor, and the grinder of the poor man’s
face, and the remover of ancient landmarks, and the subverter of ancient
houses, were at the same stake with me, I could say, ‘Light the fire, in
God’s name!’”

“This is dreadful,” said Lucy; “I have never seen the poor deserted
woman in this state of mind; but age and poverty can ill bear reproach.
Come, Henry, we will leave her for the present; she wishes to speak
with the Master alone. We will walk homeward, and rest us,” she added,
looking at Ravenswood, “by the Mermaiden’s Well.” “And Alice,” said the
boy, “if you know of any hare that comes through among the deer, and
makes them drop their calves out of season, you may tell her, with my
compliments to command, that if Norman has not got a silver bullet ready
for her, I’ll lend him one of my doublet-buttons on purpose.”

Alice made no answer till she was aware that the sister and brother were
out of hearing. She then said to Ravenswood: “And you, too, are angry
with me for my love? It is just that strangers should be offended, but
you, too, are angry!”

“I am not angry, Alice,” said the Master, “only surprised that you,
whose good sense I have heard so often praised, should give way to
offensive and unfounded suspicions.”

“Offensive!” said Alice. “Ay, trust is ever offensive; but, surely, not
unfounded.”

“I tell you, dame, most groundless,” replied Ravenswood.

“Then the world has changed its wont, and the Ravenswoods their
hereditary temper, and the eyes of Old Alice’s understanding are yet
more blind than those of her countenance. When did a Ravenswood seek the
house of his enemy but with the purpose of revenge? and hither are you
come, Edgar Ravenswood, either in fatal anger or in still more fatal
love.”

“In neither,” said Ravenswood, “I give you mine honour--I mean, I assure
you.”

Alice could not see his blushing cheek, but she noticed his hesitation,
and that he retracted the pledge which he seemed at first disposed to
attach to his denial.

“It is so, then,” she said, “and therefore she is to tarry by the
Mermaiden’s Well! Often has it been called a place fatal to the race of
Ravenswood--often has it proved so; but never was it likely to verify
old sayings as much as on this day.”

“You drive me to madness, Alice,” said Ravenswood; “you are more silly
and more superstitious than old Balderstone. Are you such a wretched
Christian as to suppose I would in the present day levy war against the
Ashton family, as was the sanguinary custom in elder times? or do you
suppose me so foolish, that I cannot walk by a young lady’s side without
plunging headlong in love with her?”

“My thoughts,” replied Alice, “are my own; and if my mortal sight
is closed to objects present with me, it may be I can look with more
steadiness into future events. Are you prepared to sit lowest at the
board which was once your father’s own, unwillingly, as a connexion and
ally of his proud successor? Are you ready to live on his bounty; to
follow him in the bye-paths of intrigue and chicane, which none can
better point out to you; to gnaw the bones of his prey when he has
devoured the substance? Can you say as Sir William Ashton says, think
as he thinks, vote as he votes, and call your father’s murderer your
worshipful father-in-law and revered patron? Master of Ravenswood, I am
the eldest servant of your house, and I would rather see you shrouded
and coffined!”

The tumult in Ravenswood’s mind was uncommonly great; she struck upon
and awakened a chord which he had for some time successfully silenced.
He strode backwards and forwards through the little garden with a hasty
pace; and at length checking himself, and stopping right opposite to
Alice, he exclaimed: “Woman! on the verge of the grave, dare you urge
the son of your master to blood and to revenge?”

“God forbid!” said Alice, solemnly; “and therefore I would have you
depart these fatal bounds, where your love, as well as your hatred,
threatens sure mischief, or at least disgrace, both to yourself and
others. I would shield, were it in the power of this withered hand, the
Ashtons from you, and you from them, and both from their own passions.
You can have nothing--ought to have nothing, in common with them. Begone
from among them; and if God has destined vengeance on the oppressor’s
house, do not you be the instrument.”

“I will think on what you have said, Alice,” said Ravenswood, more
composedly. “I believe you mean truly and faithfully by me, but you urge
the freedom of an ancient domestic somewhat too far. But farewell; and
if Heaven afford me better means, I will not fail to contribute to your
comfort.”

He attempted to put a piece of gold into her hand, which she refused to
receive; and, in the slight struggle attending his wish to force it upon
her, it dropped to the earth.

“Let it remain an instant on the ground,” said Alice, as the Master
stooped to raise it; “and believe me, that piece of gold is an emblem of
her whom you love; she is as precious, I grant, but you must stoop even
to abasement before you can win her. For me, I have as little to do with
gold as with earthly passions; and the best news that the world has in
store for me is, that Edgar Ravenswood is an hundred miles distant from
the seat of his ancestors, with the determination never again to behold
it.”

“Alice,” said the Master, who began to think this earnestness had some
more secret cause than arose from anything that the blind woman could
have gathered from this casual visit, “I have heard you praised by my
mother for your sense, acuteness, and fidelity; you are no fool to start
at shadows, or to dread old superstitious saws, like Caleb Balderstone;
tell me distinctly where my danger lies, if you are aware of any which
is tending towards me. If I know myself, I am free from all such views
respecting Miss Ashton as you impute to me. I have necessary business
to settle with Sir William; that arranged, I shall depart, and with as
little wish, as you may easily believe, to return to a place full of
melancholy subjects of reflection, as you have to see me here.” Alice
bent her sightless eyes on the ground, and was for some time plunged in
deep meditation. “I will speak the truth,” she said at length, raising
up her head--“I will tell you the source of my apprehensions, whether
my candour be for good or for evil. Lucy Ashton loves you, Lord of
Ravenswood!”

“It is impossible,” said the Master.

“A thousand circumstances have proved it to me,” replied the blind
woman. “Her thoughts have turned on no one else since you saved her
from death, and that my experienced judgment has won from her own
conversation. Having told you this--if you are indeed a gentleman
and your father’s son--you will make it a motive for flying from her
presence. Her passion will die like a lamp for want of that the flame
should feed upon; but, if you remain here, her destruction, or yours,
or that of both, will be the inevitable consequence of her misplaced
attachment. I tell you this secret unwillingly, but it could not have
been hid long from your own observation, and it is better you learn
it from mine. Depart, Master of Ravenswood; you have my secret. If you
remain an hour under Sir William Ashton’s roof without the resolution
to marry his daughter, you are a villain; if with the purpose of allying
yourself with kin, you are an infatuated and predestined fool.”

So saying, the old blind woman arose, assumed her staff, and, tottering
to her hut, entered it and closed the door, leaving Ravenswood to his
own reflections.




CHAPTER XX.

     Lovelier in her own retired abode
     ....than Naiad by the side
     Of Grecian brook--or Lady of the Mere
     Lone sitting by the shores of old romance.

     WORDSWORTH.

THE meditations of Ravenswood were of a very mixed complexion. He saw
himself at once in the very dilemma which he had for some time felt
apprehensive he might be placed in. The pleasure he felt in Lucy’s
company had indeed approached to fascination, yet it had never
altogether surmounted his internal reluctance to wed with the daughter
of his father’s foe; and even in forgiving Sir William Ashton the
injuries which his family had received, and giving him credit for the
kind intentions he professed to entertain, he could not bring himself to
contemplate as possible an alliance betwixt their houses. Still, he felt
that Alice poke truth, and that his honour now required he should
take an instant leave of Ravenswood Castle, or become a suitor of Lucy
Ashton. The possibility of being rejected, too, should he make advances
to her wealthy and powerful father--to sue for the hand of an Ashton and
be refused--this were a consummation too disgraceful. “I wish her well,”
 he said to himself, “and for her sake I forgive the injuries her father
has done to my house; but I will never--no, never see her more!”

With one bitter pang he adopted this resolution, just as he came to
where two paths parted: the one to the Mermaiden’s Fountain, where he
knew Lucy waited him, the other leading to the castle by another and
more circuitous road. He paused an instant when about to take the latter
path, thinking what apology he should make for conduct which must needs
seem extraordinary, and had just muttered to himself, “Sudden news from
Edinburgh--any pretext will serve; only let me dally no longer here,”
 when young Henry came flying up to him, half out of breath: “Master,
Master you must give Lucy your arm back to the castle, for I cannot give
her mine; for Norman is waiting for me, and I am to go with him to make
his ring-walk, and I would not stay away for a gold Jacobus; and Lucy is
afraid to walk home alone, though all the wild nowt have been shot, and
so you must come away directly.”

Betwixt two scales equally loaded, a feather’s weight will turn the
scale. “It is impossible for me to leave the young lady in the wood
alone,” said Ravenswood; “to see her once more can be of little
consequence, after the frequent meetings we have had. I ought, too, in
courtesy, to apprise her of my intention to quit the castle.”

And having thus satisfied himself that he was taking not only a wise,
but an absolutely necessary, step, he took the path to the fatal
fountain. Henry no sooner saw him on the way to join his sister than he
was off like lightning in another direction, to enjoy the society of the
forester in their congenial pursuits. Ravenswood, not allowing himself
to give a second thought to the propriety of his own conduct, walked
with a quick step towards the stream, where he found Lucy seated alone
by the ruin.

She sate upon one of the disjointed stones of the ancient fountain,
and seemed to watch the progress of its current, as it bubbled forth to
daylight, in gay and sparkling profusion, from under the shadow of the
ribbed and darksome vault, with which veneration, or perhaps remorse,
had canopied its source. To a superstitious eye, Lucy Ashton, folded in
her plaided mantle, with her long hair, escaping partly from the snood
and falling upon her silver neck, might have suggested the idea of
the murdered Nymph of the fountain. But Ravenswood only saw a female
exquisitely beautiful, and rendered yet more so in his eyes--how
could it be otherwise?--by the consciousness that she had placed her
affections on him. As he gazed on her, he felt his fixed resolution
melting like wax in the sun, and hastened, therefore, from his
concealment in the neighbouring thicket. She saluted him, but did not
arise from the stone on which she was seated.

“My madcap brother,” she said, “has left me, but I expect him back in
a few minutes; for, fortunately, as anything pleases him for a minute,
nothing has charms for him much longer.”

Ravenswood did not feel the power of informing Lucy that her brother
meditated a distant excursion, and would not return in haste. He sate
himself down on the grass, at some little distance from Miss Ashton, and
both were silent for a short space.

“I like this spot,” said Lucy at length, as if she found the silence
embarrassing; “the bubbling murmur of the clear fountain, the waving of
the trees, the profusion of grass and wild-flowers that rise among the
ruins, make it like a scene in romance. I think, too, I have heard it is
a spot connected with the legendary lore which I love so well.”

“It has been thought,” answered Ravenswood, “a fatal spot to my family;
and I have some reason to term it so, for it was here I first saw Miss
Ashton; and it is here I must take my leave of her for ever.”

The blood, which the first part of this speech called into Lucy’s
cheeks, was speedily expelled by its conclusion.

“To take leave of us, Master!” she exclaimed; “what can have happened
to hurry you away? I know Alice hates--I mean dislikes my father; and
I hardly understood her humour to-day, it was so mysterious. But I
am certain my father is sincerely grateful for the high service you
rendered us. Let me hope that, having won your friendship hardly, we
shall not lose it lightly.”

“Lose it, Miss Ashton!” said the Master of Ravenswood. “No; wherever my
fortune calls me--whatever she inflicts upon me--it is your friend--your
sincere friend, who acts or suffers. But there is a fate on me, and I
must go, or I shall add the ruin of others to my own.”

“Yet do not go from us, Master,” said Lucy; and she laid her hand,
in all simplicity and kindness, upon the skirt of his cloak, as if to
detain him. “You shall not part from us. My father is powerful, he has
friends that are more so than himself; do not go till you see what his
gratitude will do for you. Believe me, he is already labouring in your
behalf with the council.”

“It may be so,” said the Master, proudly; “yet it is not to your father,
Miss Ashton, but to my own exertions, that I ought to owe success in the
career on which I am about to enter. My preparations are already made--a
sword and a cloak, and a bold heart and a determined hand.”

Lucy covered her face her hands, and the tears, in spite of her, forced
their way between her fingers.

“Forgive me,” said Ravenswood, taking her right hand, which, after
slight resistance, she yielded to him, still continuing to shade her
face with the left--“I am too rude--too rough--too intractable to deal
with any being so soft and gentle as you are. Forget that so stern a
vision has crossed your path of life; and let me pursue mine, sure that
I can meet with no worse misfortune after the moment it divides me from
your side.”

Lucy wept on, but her tears were less bitter. Each attempt which the
Master made to explain his purpose of departure only proved a new
evidence of his desire to stay; until, at length, instead of bidding her
farewell, he gave his faith to her for ever, and received her troth
in return. The whole passed so suddenly, and arose so much out of the
immediate impulse of the moment, that ere the Master of Ravenswood could
reflect upon the consequences of the step which he had taken, their
lips, as well as their hands, had pledged the sincerity of their
affection.

“And now,” he said, after a moment’s consideration, “it is fit I should
speak to Sir William Ashton; he must know of our engagement. Ravenswood
must not seem to dwell under his roof to solicit clandestinely the
affections of his daughter.”

“You would not speak to my father on the subject?” said Lucy,
doubtingly; and then added more warmly: “Oh do not--do not! Let your lot
in life be determined--your station and purpose ascertained, before you
address my father. I am sure he loves you--I think he will consent; but
then my mother----!”

She paused, ashamed to express the doubt she felt how far her father
dared to form any positive resolution on this most important subject
without the consent of his lady.

“Your mother, my Lucy!” replied Ravenswood. “She is of the house of
Douglas, a house that has intermarried with mine even when its glory
and power were at the highest; what could your mother object to my
alliance?”

“I did not say object,” said Lucy; “but she is jealous of her rights,
and may claim a mother’s title to be consulted in the first instance.”

“Be it so,” replied Ravenswood. “London is distant, but a letter will
reach it and receive an answer within a fortnight; I will not press on
the Lord Keeper for an instant reply to my proposal.”

“But,” hesitated Lucy, “were it not better to wait--to wait a few weeks?
Were my mother to see you--to know you, I am sure she would approve;
but you are unacquainted personally, and the ancient feud between the
families----”

Ravenswood fixed upon her his keen dark eyes, as if he was desirous of
penetrating into her very soul.

“Lucy,” he said, “I have sacrificed to you projects of vengeance long
nursed, and sworn to with ceremonies little better than heathen--I
sacrificed them to your image, ere I knew the worth which it
represented. In the evening which succeeded my poor father’s funeral, I
cut a lock from my hair, and, as it consumed in the fire, I swore that
my rage and revenge should pursue his enemies, until they shrivelled
before me like that scorched-up symbol of annihilation.”

“It was a deadly sin,” said Lucy, turning pale, “to make a vow so
fatal.”

“I acknowledge it,” said Ravenswood, “and it had been a worse crime
to keep it. It was for your sake that I abjured these purposes of
vengeance, though I scarce knew that such was the argument by which I
was conquered, until I saw you once more, and became conscious of the
influence you possessed over me.”

“And why do you now,” said Lucy, “recall sentiments so
terrible--sentiments so inconsistent with those you profess for me--with
those your importunity has prevailed on me to acknowledge?”

“Because,” said her lover, “I would impress on you the price at which I
have bought your love--the right I have to expect your constancy. I
say not that I have bartered for it the honour of my house, its last
remaining possession; but though I say it not, and think it not, I
cannot conceal from myself that the world may do both.”

“If such are your sentiments,” said Lucy, “you have played a cruel game
with me. But it is not too late to give it over: take back the faith and
troth which you could not plight to me without suffering abatement of
honour--let what is passed be as if it had not been--forget me; I will
endeavour to forget myself.”

“You do me injustice,” said the Master of Ravenswood--“by all I
hold true and honourable, you do me the extremity of injustice; if I
mentioned the price at which I have bought your love, it is only to show
how much I prize it, to bind our engagement by a still firmer tie, and
to show, by what I have done to attain this station in your regard, how
much I must suffer should you ever break your faith.”

“And why, Ravenswood,” answered Lucy, “should you think that possible?
Why should you urge me with even the mention of infidelity? Is it
because I ask you to delay applying to my father for a little space of
time? Bind me by what vows you please; if vows are unnecessary to
secure constancy, they may yet prevent suspicion.” Ravenswood pleaded,
apologised, and even kneeled, to appease her displeasure; and Lucy, as
placable as she was single-hearted, readily forgave the offence which
his doubts had implied. The dispute thus agitated, however, ended by the
lovers going through an emblematic ceremony of their troth-plight, of
which the vulgar still preserve some traces. They broke betwixt them
the thin broad-piece of gold which Alice had refused to receive from
Ravenswood.

“And never shall this leave my bosom,” said Lucy, as she hung the piece
of gold round her neck, and concealed it with her handkerchief, “until
you, Edgar Ravenswood, ask me to resign it to you; and, while I wear it,
never shall that heart acknowledge another love than yours.”

With like protestations, Ravenswood placed his portion of the coin
opposite to his heart. And now, at length, it struck them that time had
hurried fast on during this interview, and their absence at the castle
would be subject of remark, if not of alarm. As they arose to leave the
fountain which had been witness of their mutual engagement, an arrow
whistled through the air, and struck a raven perched on the sere branch
of an old oak, near to where they had been seated. The bird fluttered a
few yards and dropped at the feet of Lucy, whose dress was stained with
some spots of its blood.

Miss Ashton was much alarmed, and Ravenswood, surprised and angry,
looked everywhere for the marksman, who had given them a proof of his
skill as little expected as desired. He was not long of discovering
himself, being no other than Henry Ashton, who came running up with a
crossbow in his hand.

“I knew I should startle you,” he said; “and do you know, you looked so
busy that I hoped it would have fallen souse on your heads before you
were aware of it. What was the Master saying to you, Lucy?”

“I was telling your sister what an idle lad you were, keeping us waiting
here for you so long,” said Ravenswood, to save Lucy’s confusion.

“Waiting for me! Why, I told you to see Lucy home, and that I was to go
to make the ring-walk with old Norman in the Hayberry thicket, and you
may be sure that would take a good hour, and we have all the deer’s
marks and furnishes got, while you were sitting here with Lucy, like a
lazy loon.”

“Well, well, Mr. Henry,” said Ravenswood; “but let us see how you will
answer to me for killing the raven. Do you know, the ravens are all
under the protection of the Lords of Ravenswood, and to kill one in
their presence is such bad luck that it deserves the stab?”

“And that’s what Norman said,” replied the boy; “he came as far with
me as within a flight-shot of you, and he said he never saw a raven sit
still so near living folk, and he wished it might be for good luck, for
the raven is one of the wildest birds that flies, unless it be a tame
one; and so I crept on and on, till I was within threescore yards of
him, and then whiz went the bolt, and there he lies, faith! Was it not
well shot? and, I dare say, I have not shot in a crossbow!--not ten
times, maybe.”

“Admirably shot, indeed,” said Ravenswood; “and you will be a fine
marksman if you practise hard.”

“And that’s what Norman says,” answered the boy; “but I am sure it is
not my fault if I do not practise enough; for, of free will, I would do
little else, only my father and tutor are angry sometimes, and only Miss
Lucy there gives herself airs about my being busy, for all she can
sit idle by a well-side the whole day, when she has a handsome young
gentleman to prate with. I have known her do so twenty times, if you
will believe me.”

The boy looked at his sister as he spoke, and, in the midst of his
mischievous chatter, had the sense to see that he was really inflicting
pain upon her, though without being able to comprehend the cause or the
amount.

“Come now, Lucy,” he said, “don’t greet; and if I have said anything
beside the mark, I’ll deny it again; and what does the Master of
Ravenswood care if you had a hundred sweethearts? so ne’er put finger in
your eye about it.”

The Master of Ravenswood was, for the moment, scarce satisfied with what
he heard; yet his good sense naturally regarded it as the chatter of a
spoilt boy, who strove to mortify his sister in the point which seemed
most accessible for the time. But, although of a temper equally slow in
receiving impressions and obstinate in retaining them, the prattle
of Henry served to nourish in his mind some vague suspicion that his
present engagement might only end in his being exposed, like a conquered
enemy in a Roman triumph, a captive attendant on the car of a victor who
meditated only the satiating his pride at the expense of the
vanquished. There was, we repeat it, no real ground whatever for such
an apprehension, nor could he be said seriously to entertain such for a
moment. Indeed, it was impossible to look at the clear blue eye of
Lucy Ashton, and entertain the slightest permanent doubt concerning
the sincerity of her disposition. Still, however, conscious pride and
conscious poverty combined to render a mind suspicious which in more
fortunate circumstances would have been a stranger to that as well as to
every other meanness.

They reached the castle, where Sir William Ashton, who had been alarmed
by the length of their stay, met them in the hall.

“Had Lucy,” he said, “been in any other company than that of one who had
shown he had so complete power of protecting her, he confessed he should
have been very uneasy, and would have despatched persons in quest of
them. But, in the company of the Master of Ravenswood, he knew his
daughter had nothing to dread.” Lucy commenced some apology for their
long delay, but, conscience-struck, becames confused as she proceeded;
and when Ravenswood, coming to her assistance, endeavoured to render the
explanation complete and satisfactory, he only involved himself in the
same disorder, like one who, endeavouring to extricate his companion
from a slough, entangles himself in the same tenacious swamp. It cannot
be supposed that the confusion of the two youthful lovers escaped the
observation of the subtle lawyer, accustomed, by habit and profession,
to trace human nature through all her windings. But it was not his
present policy to take any notice of what he observed. He desired to
hold the Master of Ravenswood bound, but wished that he himself should
remain free; and it did not occur to him that his plan might be defeated
by Lucy’s returning the passion which he hoped she might inspire. If
she should adopt some romantic feelings towards Ravenswood, in which
circumstances, or the positive and absolute opposition of Lady Ashton,
might render it unadvisable to indulge her, the Lord Keeper conceived
they might be easily superseded and annulled by a journey to Edinburgh,
or even to London, a new set of Brussels lace, and the soft whispers of
half a dozen lovers, anxious to replace him whom it was convenient she
should renounce. This was his provision for the worst view of the case.
But, according to its more probable issue, any passing favours she
might entertain for the Master of Ravenswood might require encouragement
rather than repression.

This seemed the more likely, as he had that very morning, since their
departure from the castle, received a letter, the contents of which he
hastened to communicate to Ravenswood. A foot-post had arrived with
a packet to the Lord Keeper from that friend whom we have already
mentioned, who was labouring hard underhand to consolidate a band of
patriots, at the head of whom stood Sir William’s greatest terror, the
active and ambitious Marquis of A----. The success of this convenient
friend had been such, that he had obtained from Sir William, not indeed
a directly favourable answer, but certainly a most patient hearing. This
he had reported to his principal, who had replied by the ancient French
adage, “Chateau qui parle, et femme qui ecoute, l’un et l’autre va se
rendre.” A statesman who hears you propose a change of measures without
reply was, according to the Marquis’s opinion, in the situation of the
fortress which parleys and the lady who listens, and he resolved to
press the siege of the Lord Keeper.

The packet, therefore, contained a letter from his friend and ally,
and another from himself, to the Lord Keeper, frankly offering an
unceremonious visit. They were crossing the country to go to the
southward; the roads were indifferent; the accommodation of the inns
as execrable as possible; the Lord Keeper had been long acquainted
intimately with one of his correspondents, and, though more slightly
known to the Marquis, had yet enough of his lordship’s acquaintance to
render the visit sufficiently natural, and to shut the mouths of those
who might be disposed to impute it to a political intrigue. He instantly
accepted the offered visit, determined, however, that he would not
pledge himself an inch farther for the furtherance of their views than
REASON (by which he meant his own self-interest) should plainly point
out to him as proper.

Two circumstances particularly delighted him--the presence of
Ravenswood, and the absence of his own lady. By having the former under
his roof, he conceived he might be able to quash all such hazardous and
hostile proceedings as he might otherwise have been engaged in, under
the patronage of the Marquis; and Lucy, he foresaw, would make, for his
immediate purpose of delay and procrastination, a much better mistress
of his family than her mother, who would, he was sure, in some shape
or other, contrive to disconcert his political schemes by her proud and
implacable temper.

His anxious solicitations that the Master would stay to receive
his kinsman, were, of course, readily complied with, since the
eclaircissement which had taken place at the Mermaiden’s Fountain
had removed all wish for sudden departure. Lucy and Lockhard, had,
therefore, orders to provide all things necessary in their different
departments, for receiving the expected guests with a pomp and display
of luxury very uncommon in Scotland at that remote period.




CHAPTER XXI.

     Marall: Sir, the man of honour’s come,
     Newly alighted----Overreach: In without reply,
     And do as I command....
     Is the loud music I gave order for
     Ready to receive him?

     New Way to pay Old Debts.

SIR WILLIAM ASHTON, although a man of sense, legal information, and
great practical knowledge of the world, had yet some points of character
which corresponded better with the timidity of his disposition and the
supple arts by which he had risen in the world, than to the degree
of eminence which he had attained; as they tended to show an original
mediocrity of understanding, however highly it had been cultivated, and
a native meanness of disposition, however carefully veiled. He loved the
ostentatious display of his wealth, less as a man to whom habit has
made it necessary, than as one to whom it is still delightful from its
novelty. The most trivial details did not escape him; and Lucy soon
learned to watch the flush of scorn which crossed Ravenswood’s cheek,
when he heard her father gravely arguing with Lockhard, nay, even with
the old housekeeper, upon circumstances which, in families of rank,
are left uncared for, because it is supposed impossible they can be
neglected.

“I could pardon Sir William,” said Ravenswood, one evening after he
had left the room, “some general anxiety upon this occasion, for the
Marquis’s visit is an honour, and should be received as such; but I am
worn out by these miserable minutiae of the buttery, and the larder,
and the very hencoop--they drive me beyond my patience; I would rather
endure the poverty of Wolf’s Crag than be pestered with the wealth of
Ravenswood Castle.”

“And yet,” said Lucy, “it was by attention to these minutiae that my
father acquired the property----”

“Which my ancestors sold for lack of it,” replied Ravenswood. “Be it so;
a porter still bears but a burden, though the burden be of gold.”

Lucy sighed; she perceived too plainly that her lover held in scorn the
manners and habits of a father to whom she had long looked up as her
best and most partial friend, whose fondness had often consoled her for
her mother’s contemptuous harshness.

The lovers soon discovered that they differed upon other and no less
important topics. Religion, the mother of peace, was, in those days of
discord, so much misconstrued and mistaken, that her rules and forms
were the subject of the most opposite opinions and the most hostile
animosities. The Lord Keeper, being a Whig, was, of course, a
Presbyterian, and had found it convenient, at different periods, to
express greater zeal for the kirk than perhaps he really felt. His
family, equally of course, were trained under the same institution.
Ravenswood, as we know, was a High Churchman, or Episcopalian, and
frequently objected to Lucy the fanaticism of some of her own
communion, while she intimated, rather than expressed, horror at the
latitudinarian principles which she had been taught to think connected
with the prelatical form of church government.

Thus, although their mutual affection seemed to increase rather than to
be diminished as their characters opened more fully on each other, the
feelings of each were mingled with some less agreeable ingredients. Lucy
felt a secret awe, amid all her affection for Ravenswood. His soul was
of an higher, prouder character than those with whom she had hitherto
mixed in intercourse; his ideas were more fierce and free; and he
contemned many of the opinions which had been inculcated upon her as
chiefly demanding her veneration. On the other hand, Ravenswood saw in
Lucy a soft and flexible character, which, in his eyes at least, seemed
too susceptible of being moulded to any form by those with whom
she lived. He felt that his own temper required a partner of a more
independent spirit, who could set sail with him on his course of life,
resolved as himself to dare indifferently the storm and the favouring
breeze. But Lucy was so beautiful, so devoutly attached to him, of a
temper so exquisitely soft and kind, that, while he could have wished
it were possible to inspire her with a greater degree of firmness and
resolution, and while he sometimes became impatient of the extreme fear
which she expressed of their attachment being prematurely discovered,
he felt that the softness of a mind, amounting almost to feebleness,
rendered her even dearer to him, as a being who had voluntarily clung
to him for protection, and made him the arbiter of her fate for weal or
woe. His feelings towards her at such moments were those which have been
since so beautifully expressed by our immortal Joanna Baillie:

     Thou sweetest thing,
     That e’er did fix its lightly-fibred sprays
     To the rude rock, ah! wouldst thou cling to me?
     Rough and storm-worn I am; yet love me as
     Thou truly dost, I will love thee again
     With true and honest heart, though all unmeet
     To be the mate of such sweet gentleness.

Thus the very points in which they differed seemed, in some measure, to
ensure the continuance of their mutual affection. If, indeed, they had
so fully appreciated each other’s character before the burst of passion
in which they hastily pledged their faith to each other, Lucy might have
feared Ravenswood too much ever to have loved him, and he might have
construed her softness and docile temper as imbecility, rendering her
unworthy of his regard. But they stood pledged to each other; and Lucy
only feared that her lover’s pride might one day teach him to regret
his attachment; Ravenswood, that a mind so ductile as Lucy’s might, in
absence or difficulties, be induced, by the entreaties or influence of
those around her, to renounce the engagement she had formed.

“Do not fear it,” said Lucy, when upon one occasion a hint of such
suspicion escaped her lover; “the mirrors which receive the reflection
of all successive objects are framed of hard materials like glass or
steel; the softer substances, when they receive an impression, retain it
undefaced.”

“This is poetry, Lucy,” said Ravenswood; “and in poetry there is always
fallacy, and sometimes fiction.”

“Believe me, then, once more, in honest prose,” said Lucy, “that, though
I will never wed man without the consent of my parents, yet neither
force nor persuasion shall dispose of my hand till you renounce the
right I have given you to it.”

The lovers had ample time for such explanations. Henry was now more
seldom their companion, being either a most unwilling attendant upon the
lessons of his tutor, or a forward volunteer under the instructions of
the foresters or grooms. As for the Keeper, his mornings were spent in
his study, maintaining correspondences of all kinds, and balancing in
his anxious mind the various intelligence which he collected from every
quarter concerning the expected change of Scottish politics, and the
probable strength of the parties who were about to struggle for power.
At other times he busied himself about arranging, and countermanding, and
then again arranging, the preparations which he judged necessary for the
reception of the Marquis of A----, whose arrival had been twice delayed
by some necessary cause of detention.

In the midst of all these various avocations, political and domestic,
he seemed not to observe how much his daughter and his guest were thrown
into each other’s society, and was censured by many of his neighbours,
according to the fashion of neighbours in all countries, for suffering
such an intimate connexion to take place betwixt two young persons.
The only natural explanation was, that he designed them for each other;
while, in truth, his only motive was to temporise and procrastinate
until he should discover the real extent of the interest which the
Marquis took in Ravenswood’s affairs, and the power which he was likely
to possess of advancing them. Until these points should be made both
clear and manifest, the Lord Keeper resolved that he would do nothing
to commit himself, either in one shape or other; and, like many cunning
persons, he overreached himself deplorably.

Amongst those who had been disposed to censure, with the greatest
severity, the conduct of Sir William Ashton, in permitting the prolonged
residence of Ravenswood under his roof, and his constant attendance on
Miss Ashton, was the new Laird of Girnington, and his faithful squire
and bottleholder, personages formerly well known to us by the names of
Hayston and Bucklaw, and his companion Captain Craigengelt. The former
had at length succeeded to the extensive property of his long-lived
grand-aunt, and to considerable wealth besides, which he had employed
in redeeming his paternal acres (by the title appertaining to which he
still chose to be designated), notwithstanding Captain Craigengelt had
proposed to him a most advantageous mode of vesting the money in Law’s
scheme, which was just then broached, and offered his services to travel
express to Paris for the purpose. But Bucklaw had so far derived wisdom
from adversity, that he would listen to no proposal which Craigengelt
could invent, which had the slightest tendency to risk his
newly-acquired independence. He that had once eat pease-bannocks, drank
sour wine, and slept in the secret chamber at Wolf’s Crag, would, he
said, prize good cheer and a soft bed as long as he lived, and take
special care never to need such hospitality again.

Craigengelt, therefore, found himself disappointed in the first hopes
he had entertained of making a good hand of the Laird of Bucklaw. Still,
however, he reaped many advantages from his friend’s good fortune.
Bucklaw, who had never been at all scrupulous in choosing his
companions, was accustomed to, and entertained by, a fellow whom he
could either laugh with or laugh at as he had a mind, who would take,
according to Scottish phrase, “the bit and the buffet,” understood all
sports, whether within or without doors, and, when the laird had a mind
for a bottle of wine (no infrequent circumstance), was always ready to
save him from the scandal of getting drunk by himself. Upon these terms,
Craigengelt was the frequent, almost the constant, inmate of the house
of Girnington.

In no time, and under no possibility of circumstances, could good have
been derived from such an intimacy, however its bad consequences might
be qualified by the thorough knowledge which Bucklaw possessed of his
dependant’s character, and the high contempt in which he held it. But,
as circumstances stood, this evil communication was particularly liable
to corrupt what good principles nature had implanted in the patron.

Craigengelt had never forgiven the scorn with which Ravenswood had torn
the mask of courage and honesty from his countenance; and to exasperate
Bucklaw’s resentment against him was the safest mode of revenge which
occurred to his cowardly, yet cunning and malignant, disposition.

He brought up on all occasions the story of the challenge which
Ravenswood had declined to accept, and endeavoured, by every possible
insinuation, to make his patron believe that his honour was concerned
in bringing that matter to an issue by a present discussion with
Ravenswood. But respecting this subject Bucklaw imposed on him, at
length, a peremptory command of silence.

“I think,” he said, “the Master has treated me unlike a gentleman, and
I see no right he had to send me back a cavalier answer when I demanded
the satisfaction of one. But he gave me my life once; and, in looking
the matter over at present, I put myself but on equal terms with him.
Should he cross me again, I shall consider the old accompt as balanced,
and his Mastership will do well to look to himself.”

“That he should,” re-echoed Craigengelt; “for when you are in practice,
Bucklaw, I would bet a magnum you are through him before the third
pass.”

“Then you know nothing of the matter,” said Bucklaw, “and you never saw
him fence.”

“And I know nothing of the matter?” said the dependant--“a good jest, I
promise you! And though I never saw Ravenswood fence, have I not been at
Monsieur Sagoon’s school, who was the first maitre d’armes at Paris;
and have I not been at Signor Poco’s at Florence, and Meinheer
Durchstossen’s at Vienna, and have I not seen all their play?”

“I don’t know whether you have or not,” said Bucklaw; “but what about
it, though you had?”

“Only that I will be d--d if ever I saw French, Italian, or
High-Dutchman ever make foot, hand, and eye keep time half so well as
you, Bucklaw.”

“I believe you lie, Craigie,” said Bucklaw; “however, I can hold my own,
both with single rapier, backsword, sword and dagger, broadsword, or
case of falchions--and that’s as much as any gentleman need know of the
matter.”

“And the doubt of what ninety-nine out of a hundred know,” said
Craigengelt; “they learn to change a few thrusts with the small sword,
and then, forsooth, they understand the noble art of defence! Now, when
I was at Rouen in the year 1695, there was a Chevalier de Chapon and I
went to the opera, where we found three bits of English birkies----” “Is
it a long story you are going to tell?” said Bucklaw, interrupting him
without ceremony.

“Just as you like,” answered the parasite, “for we made short work of
it.”

“Then I like it short,” said Bucklaw. “Is it serious or merry?”

“Devilish serious, I assure you, and so they found it; for the Chevalier
and I----”

“Then I don’t like it at all,” said Bucklaw; “so fill a brimmer of
my auld auntie’s claret, rest her heart! And, as the Hielandman says,
Skioch doch na skiall.”

“That was what tough old Sir Even Dhu used to say to me when I was out
with the metall’d lads in 1689. ‘Craigengelt,’ he used to say, ‘you
are as pretty a fellow as ever held steel in his grip, but you have one
fault.’”

“If he had known you as long as I have don,” said Bucklaw, “he would
have found out some twenty more; but hand long stories, give us your
toast, man.”

Craigengelt rose, went a-tiptoe to the door, peeped out, shut it
carefully, came back again, clapped his tarnished gold-laced hat on one
side of his head, took his glass in one hand, and touching the hilt of
his hanger with the other, named, “The King over the water.”

“I tell you what it is, Captain Craigengelt,” said Bucklaw; “I shall
keep my mind to myself on thse subjects, having too much respect for the
memory of my venerable Aunt Girnington to put her lands and tenements
in the way of committing treason against established authority. Bring me
King James to Edinburgh, Captain, with thirty thousand men at his back,
and I’ll tell you what I think about his title; but as for running my
neck into a noose, and my good broad lands into the statutory penalties,
‘in that case made and provided,’ rely upon it, you will find me no such
fool. So, when you mean to vapour with your hanger and your dram-cup
in support of treasonable toasts, you must find your liquor and company
elsewhere.”

“Well, then,” said Craigengelt, “name the toast yourself, and be it what
it like, I’ll pledge you, were it a mile to the bottom.”

“And I’ll give you a toast that deserves it, my boy,” said Bucklaw;
“what say you to Miss Lucy Ashton?”

“Up with it,” said the Captain, as he tossed off his brimmer, “the
bonniest lass in Lothian! What a pity the old sneckdrawing Whigamore,
her father, is about to throw her away upon that rag of pride and
beggary, the Master of Ravenswood!”

“That’s not quite so clear,” said Bucklaw, in a tone which, though it
seemed indifferent, excited his companion’s eager curiosity; and not
that only, but also his hope of working himself into some sort of
confidence, which might make him necessary to his patron, being by no
means satisfied to rest on mere sufferance, if he could form by art or
industry a more permanent title to his favour.

“I thought,” said he, after a moment’s pause, “that was a settled
matter; they are continually together, and nothing else is spoken of
betwixt Lammer Law and Traprain.”

“They may say what they please,” replied his patron, “but I know better;
and I’ll give you Miss Lucy Ashton’s health again, my boy.”

“And I woul drink it on my knee,” said Craigengelt, “if I thought the
girl had the spirit to jilt that d--d son of a Spaniard.”

“I am to request you will not use the word ‘jilt’ and Miss Ashton’s name
together,” said Bucklaw, gravely.

“Jilt, did I say? Discard, my lad of acres--by Jove, I meant to
discard,” replied Craigengelt; “and I hope she’ll discard him like
a small card at piquet, and take in the king of hearts, my boy! But
yet----”

“But what?” said his patron.

“But yet I know for certain they are hours together alone, and in the
woods and the fields.”

“That’s her foolish father’s dotage; that will be soon put out of the
lass’s head, if it ever gets into it,” answered Bucklaw. “And now fill
your glass again, Captain; I am going to make you happy; I am going to
let you into a secret--a plot--a noosing plot--only the noose is but
typical.”

“A marrying matter?” said Craigengelt, and his jaw fell as he asked the
question, for he suspected that matrimony would render his situation
at Girnington much more precarious than during the jolly days of his
patron’s bachelorhood.

“Ay, a marriage, man,” said Bucklaw; “but wherefore droops thy mighty
spirit, and why grow the rubies on they cheek so pale? The board will
have a corner, and the corner will have a trencher, and the trencher
will have a glass beside it; and the board-end shall be filled, and
the trencher and the glass shall be replenished for thee, if all the
petticoats in Lothian had sworn the contrary. What, man! I am not the
boy to put myself into leading-strings.”

“So says many an honest fellow,” said Craigengelt, “and some of my
special friends; but, curse me if I know the reason, the women could
never bear me, and always contrived to trundle me out of favour before
the honeymoon was over.”

“If you could have kept your ground till that was over, you might have
made a good year’s pension,” said Bucklaw.

“But I never could,” answered the dejected parasite. “There was my Lord
Castle-Cuddy--we were hand and glove: I rode his horses, borrowed money
both for him and from him, trained his hawks, and taught him how to lay
his bets; and when he took a fancy of marrying, I married him to Katie
Glegg, whom I thought myself as sure of as man could be of woman. Egad,
she had me out of the house, as if I had run on wheels, within the first
fortnight!”

“Well!” replied Bucklaw, “I think I have nothing of Castle-Cuddy about
me, or Lucy of Katie Glegg. But you see the thing will go on whether you
like it or no; the only question is, will you be useful?”

“Useful!” exclaimed the Captain, “and to thee, my lad of lands, my
darling boy, whom I would tramp barefooted through the world for! Name
time, place, mode, and circumstances, and see if I will not be useful in
all uses that can be devised.”

“Why, then, you must ride two hundred miles for me,” said the patron.

“A thousand, and call them a flea’s leap,” answered the dependant; “I’ll
cause saddle my horse directly.”

“Better stay till you know where you are to go, and what you are to
do,” quoth Bucklaw. “You know I have a kinswoman in Northumberland, Lady
Blenkensop by name, whose old acquaintance I had the misfortune to lose
in the period of my poverty, but the light of whose countenance shone
forth upon me when the sun of my prosperity began to arise.”

“D--n all such double-faced jades!” exclaimed Craigengelt, heroically;
“this I will say for John Craigengelt, that he is his friend’s friend
through good report and bad report, poverty and riches; and you know
something of that yourself, Bucklaw.”

“I have not forgot your merits,” said his patron; “I do remember that,
in my extremities, you had a mind to CRIMP me for the service of the
French king, or of the Pretender; and, moreover, that you afterwards
lent me a score of pieces, when, as I firmly believe, you had heard the
news that old Lady Girnington had a touch of the dead palsy. But don’t
be downcast, John; I believe, after all, you like me very well in your
way, and it is my misfortune to have no better counsellor at present.
To return to this Lady Blenkensop, you must know, she is a close
confederate of Duchess Sarah.”

“What! of Sall Jennings?” exclaimed Craigengelt; “then she must be a
good one.”

“Hold your tongue, and keep your Tory rants to yourself, if it be
possible,” said Bucklaw. “I tell you, that through the Duchess of
Marlborough has this Northumbrian cousin of mine become a crony of Lady
Ashton, the Keeper’s wife, or, I may say, the Lord Keeper’s Lady Keeper,
and she has favoured Lady Blenkensop with a visit on her return from
London, and is just now at her old mansion-house on the banks of the
Wansbeck. Now, sir, as it has been the use and wont of these ladies to
consider their husbands as of no importance in the management of their
own families, it has been their present pleasure, without consulting
Sir William Ashton, to put on the tapis a matrimonial alliance, to be
concluded between Lucy Ashton and my own right honourable self, Lady
Ashton acting as self-constituted plenipotentiary on the part of her
daughter and husband, and Mother Blenkensop, equally unaccredited, doing
me the honour to be my representative. You may suppose I was a little
astonished when I found that a treaty, in which I was so considerably
interested, had advanced a good way before I was even consulted.”

“Capot me! if I think that was according to the rules of the game,” said
his confidant; “and pray, what answer did you return?”

“Why, my first thought was to send the treaty to the devil, and the
negotiators along with it, for a couple of meddling old women; my next
was to laugh very hearily; and my third and last was a settled opinion
that the thing was reasonable, and would suit me well enough.”

“Why, I thought you had never seen the wench but once, and then she had
her riding-mask on; I am sure you told me so.”

“Ay, but I liked her very well then. And Ravenswood’s dirty usage of
me--shutting me out of doors to dine with the lackeys, because he
had the Lord Keeper, forsooth, and his daughter, to be guests in his
beggarly castle of starvation,--d--n me, Craigengelt, if I ever forgive
him till I play him as good a trick!”

“No more you should, if you are a lad of mettle,” said Craigengelt, the
matter now taking a turn in which he could sympathise; “and if you carry
this wench from him, it will break his heart.”

“That it will not,” said Bucklaw; “his heart is all steeled over with
reason and philosophy, things that you, Craigie, know nothing about
more than myself, God help me. But it will break his pride, though, and
that’s what I’m driving at.”

“Distance me!” said Craigengelt, “but I know the reason now of his
unmannerly behaviour at his old tumble-down tower yonder. Ashamed of
your company?--no, no! Gad, he was afraid you would cut in and carry off
the girl.”

“Eh! Craigengelt?” said Bucklaw, “do you really think so? but no, no!
he is a devilish deal prettier man than I am.” “Who--he?” exclaimed the
parasite. “He’s as black as the crook; and for his size--he’s a tall
fellow, to be sure, but give me a light, stout, middle-sized----”

“Plague on thee!” said Bucklaw, interrupting him, “and on me for
listening to you! You would say as much if I were hunch-backed. But as
to Ravenswood--he has kept no terms with me, I’ll keep none with him; if
I CAN win this girl from him, I WILL win her.”

“Win her! ‘sblood, you SHALL win her, point, quint, and quatorze, my
king of trumps; you shall pique, repique, and capot him.”

“Prithee, stop thy gambling cant for one instant,” said Bucklaw.
“Things have come thus far, that I have entertained the proposal of my
kinswoman, agreed to the terms of jointure, amount of fortune, and so
forth, and that the affair is to go forward when Lady Ashton comes down,
for she takes her daughter and her son in her own hand. Now they want me
to send up a confidential person with some writings.”

“By this good win, I’ll ride to the end of the world--the very gates of
Jericho, and the judgment-seat of Prester John, for thee!” ejaculated
the Captain.

“Why, I believe you would do something for me, and a great deal for
yourself. Now, any one could carry the writings; but you will have a
little more to do. You must contrive to drop out before my Lady Ashton,
just as if it were a matter of little consequence, the residence of
Ravenswood at her husband’s house, and his close intercourse with Miss
Ashton; and you may tell her that all the country talks of a visit from
the Marquis of A----, as it is supposed, to make up the match betwixt
Ravenswood and her daughter. I should like to hear what she says to all
this; for, rat me! if I have any idea of starting for the plate at all
if Ravenswood is to win the race, and he has odds against me already.”

“Never a bit; the wench has too much sense, and in that belief I drink
her health a third time; and, were time and place fitting, I would drink
it on bended knees, and he that would not pledge me, I would make his
guts garter his stockings.”

“Hark ye, Craigengelt; as you are going into the society of women of
rank,” said Bucklaw, “I’ll thank you to forget your strange blackguard
oaths and ‘damme’s.’ I’ll write to them, though, that you are a blunt,
untaught fellow.”

“Ay, ay,” replied Craigengelt--“a plain, blunt, honest, downright
soldier.”

“Not too honest, not too much of the soldier neither; but such as thou
art, it is my luck to need thee, for I must have spurs put to Lady
Ashton’s motions.” “I’ll dash them up to the rowel-heads,” said
Craigengelt; “she shall come here at the gallop, like a cow chased by a
whole nest of hornets, and her tail over her rump like a corkscrew.”

“And hear ye, Craigie,” said Bucklaw; “your boots and doublet are good
enough to drink in, as the man says in the play, but they are somewhat
too greasy for tea-table service; prithee, get thyself a little better
rigged out, and here is to pay all charges.”

“Nay, Bucklaw; on my soul, man, you use me ill. However,” added
Craigengelt, pocketing the money, “if you will have me so far indebted
to you, I must be conforming.”

“Well, horse and away!” said the patron, “so soon as you have got your
riding livery in trim. You may ride the black crop-ear; and, hark ye,
I’ll make you a present of him to boot.”

“I drink to the good luck of my mission,” answered the ambassador, “in a
half-pint bumper.”

“I thank ye, Craigie, and pledge you; I see nothing against it but the
father or the girl taking a tantrum, and I am told the mother can wind
them both round her little finger. Take care not to affront her with any
of your Jacobite jargon.”

“Oh, ay, true--she is a Whig, and a friend of old Sall of Marlborough;
thank my stars, I can hoist any colours at a pinch! I have fought as
hard under John Churchill as ever I did under Dundee or the Duke of
Berwick.”

“I verily believe you, Craigie,” said the lord of the mansion; “but,
Craigie, do you, pray, step down to the cellar, and fetch us up a bottle
of the Burgundy, 1678; it is in the fourth bin from the right-hand turn.
And I say, Craigie, you may fetch up half a dozen whilst you are about
it. Egad, we’ll make a night on’t!”




CHAPTER XXII.

     And soon they spied the merry-men green,
     And eke the coach and four.

     Duke upon Duke.

CRAIGENGELT set forth on his mission so soon as his equipage was
complete, prosecuted his journey with all diligence, and accomplished
his commission with all the dexterity for which bucklaw had given him
credit. As he arrived with credentials from Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, he
was extremely welcome to both ladies; and those who are prejudiced
in favour of a new acquaintance can, for a time at least, discover
excellencies in his very faults and perfections in his deficiencies.
Although both ladies were accustomed to good society, yet, being
pre-determined to find out an agreeable and well-behaved gentleman
in Mr. Hayston’s friend, they succeeded wonderfully in imposing on
themselves. It is true that Craigengelt was now handsomely dressed, and
that was a point of no small consequence. But, independent of outward
show, his blackguard impudence of address was construed into honourable
bluntness becoming his supposed military profession; his hectoring
passed for courage, and his sauciness for wit. Lest, however, any one
should think this a violation of probability, we must add, in fairness
to the two ladies, that their discernment was greatly blinded, and their
favour propitiated, by the opportune arrival of Captain Craigengelt in
the moment when they were longing for a third hand to make a party at
tredrille, in which, as in all games, whether of chance or skill, that
worthy person was a great proficient.

When he found himself established in favour, his next point was how
best to use it for the furtherance of his patron’s views. He found
Lady Ashton prepossessed strongly in favour of the motion which Lady
Blenkensop, partly from regard to her kinswoman, partly from the spirit
of match-making, had not hesitated to propose to her; so that his task
was an easy one. Bucklaw, reformed from his prodigality, was just
the sort of husband which she desired to have for her Shepherdess of
Lammermoor; and while the marriage gave her an easy fortune, and a
respectable country gentleman for her husband, Lady Ashton was
of opinion that her destinies would be fully and most favourably
accomplished. It so chanced, also, that Bucklaw, among his new
acquisitions, had gained the management of a little political interest
in a neighbouring county where the Douglas family originally held large
possessions. It was one of the bosom-hopes of Lady Ashton that her
eldest son, Sholto, should represent this county in the British
Parliament, and she saw this alliance with Bucklaw as a circumstance
which might be highly favourable to her wishes.

Craigengelt, who, in his way, by no means wanted sagacity, no sooner
discovered in what quarter the wind of Lady Ashton’s wishes sate, than
he trimmed his course accordingly. “There was little to prevent Bucklaw
himself from sitting for the county; he must carry the heat--must walk
the course. Two cousins-german, six more distant kinsmen, his factor and
his chamberlain, were all hollow votes; and the Girnington interest had
always carried, betwixt love and fear, about as many more. But Bucklaw
cared no more about riding the first horse, and that sort of thing, than
he, Craigengelt, did about a game at birkie: it was a pity his interest
was not in good guidance.”

All this Lady Ashton drank in with willing and attentive ears, resolving
internally to be herself the person who should take the management of
the political influence of her destined son-in-law, for the benefit of
her eldest-born, Sholto, and all other parties concerned.

When he found her ladyship thus favourably disposed, the Captain
proceeded, to use his employer’s phrase, to set spurs to her resolution,
by hinting at the situation of matters at Ravenswood Castle, the long
residence which the heir of that family had made with the Lord Keeper,
and the reports which--though he would be d--d ere he gave credit to any
of them--had been idly circulated in the neighbourhood. It was not the
Captain’s cue to appear himself to be uneasy on the subject of these
rumours; but he easily saw from Lady Ashton’s flushed cheek, hesitating
voice, and flashing eye, that she had caught the alarm which he intended
to communicate. She had not heard from her husband so often or so
regularly as she though him bound in duty to have written, and of this
very interesting intelligence concerning his visit to the Tower of
Wolf’s Crag, and the guest whom, with such cordiality, he had received
at Ravenswood Castle, he had suffered his lady to remain altogether
ignorant, until she now learned it by the chance information of a
stranger. Such concealment approached, in her apprehension, to a
misprision, at last, of treason, if not to actual rebellion against
her matrimonial authority; and in her inward soul she did vow to take
vengeance on the Lord Keeper, as on a subject detected in meditating
revolt. Her indignation burned the more fiercely as she found herself
obliged to suppress it in presence of Lady Blenkensop, the kinswoman,
and of Craigengelt, the confidential friend, of Bucklaw, of whose
alliance she now became trebly desirous, since it occurred to her
alarmed imagination that her husband might, in his policy or timidity,
prefer that of Ravenswood.

The Captain was engineer enough to discover that the train was fired;
and therefore heard, in the course of the same day, without the least
surprise, that Lady Ashton had resolved to abridge her visit to Lady
Blenkensop, and set forth with the peep of morning on her return to
Scotland, using all the despatch which the state of the roads and the
mode of travelling would possibly permit.

Unhappy Lord Keeper! little was he aware what a storm was travelling
towards him in all the speed with which an old-fashioned coach and six
could possibly achieve its journey. He, like Don Gayferos, “forgot his
lady fair and true,” and was only anxious about the expected visit
of the Marquis of A----. Soothfast tidings had assured him that this
nobleman was at length, and without fail, to honour his castle at one
in the afternoon, being a late dinner-hour; and much was the bustle in
consequence of the annunciation. The Lord Keeper traversed the chambers,
held consultation with the butler in the cellars, and even ventured, at
the risk of a demele with a cook of a spirit lofty enough to scorn the
admonitions of Lady Ashton herself, to peep into the kitchen. Satisfied,
at length, that everything was in as active a train of preparation as
was possible, he summoned Ravenswood and his daughter to walk upon the
terrace, for the purpose of watching, from that commanding position,
the earliest symptoms of his lordship’s approach. For this purpose, with
slow and idle step, he paraded the terrace, which, flanked with a heavy
stone battlement, stretched in front of the castle upon a level with the
first story; while visitors found access to the court by a projecting
gateway, the bartizan or flat-leaded roof of which was accessible from
the terrace by an easy flight of low and broad steps. The whole bore a
resemblance partly to a castle, partly to a nobleman’s seat; and though
calculated, in some respects, for defence, evinced that it had been
constructed under a sense of the power and security of the ancient Lords
of Ravenswood.

This pleasant walk commanded a beautiful and extensive view. But what
was most to our present purpose, there were seen from the terrace two
roads, one leading from the east, and one from the westward, which,
crossing a ridge opposed to the eminence on which the castle stood, at
different angles, gradually approached each other, until they joined not
far from the gate of the avenue. It was to the westward approach that
the Lord Keeper, from a sort of fidgeting anxiety, his daughter, from
complaisance to him, and Ravenswood, though feeling some symptoms of
internal impatience, out of complaisance to his daughter, directed their
eyes to see the precursors of the Marquis’s approach.

These were not long of presenting themselves. Two running footmen,
dressed in white, with black jockey-caps, and long staffs in their
hands, headed the train; and such was their agility, that they found
no difficulty in keeping the necessary advance, which the etiquette of
their station required, before the carriage and horsemen. Onward
they came at a long swinging trot, arguing unwearied speed in their
long-breathed calling. Such running footmen are often alluded to in old
plays (I would particularly instance Middleton’s Mad World, my Masters),
and perhaps may be still remembered by some old persons in Scotland,
as part of the retinue of the ancient nobility when travelling in full
ceremony. Behind these glancing meteors, who footed it as if the Avenger
of Blood had been behind them, came a cloud of dust, raised by riders
who preceded, attended, or followed the state-carriage of the Marquis.

The privilege of nobility, in those days, had something in it impressive
on the imagination. The dresses and liveries and number of their
attendants, their style of travelling, the imposing, and almost warlike,
air of the armed men who surrounded them, place them far above the
laird, who travelled with his brace of footmen; and as to rivalry from
the mercantile part of the community, these would as soon have thought
of imitating the state equipage of the Sovereign. At present it
is different; and I myself, Peter Pattieson, in a late journey to
Edinburgh, had the honour, in the mail-coach phrase to “change a leg”
 with a peer of the realm. It was not so in the days of which I write;
and the Marquis’s approach, so long expected in vain, now took place
in the full pomp of ancient aristocracy. Sir William Ashton was so
much interested in what he beheld, and in considering the ceremonial
of reception, in case any circumstance had been omitted, that he scarce
heard his son Henry exclaim: “There is another coach and six coming down
the east road, papa; can they both belong to the Marquis of A----?”

At length, when the youngster had fairly compelled his attention by
pulling his sleeve,

     He turned his eyes, and, as he turned, survey’d
     An awful vision.

Sure enough, another coach and six, with four servants or outriders in
attendance, was descending the hill from the eastward, at such a pace as
made it doubtful which of the carriages thus approaching from different
quarters would first reach the gate at the extremity of the avenue. The
one coach was green, the other blue; and not the green and blue chariots
in the circus of Rome or Constantinople excited more turmoil among the
citizens than the double apparition occasioned in the mind of the Lord
Keeper.

We all remember the terrible exclamation of the dying profligate, when a
friend, to destroy what he supposed the hypochondriac idea of a spectre
appearing in a certain shape at a given hour, placed before him a person
dressed up in the manner he described. “Mon Dieu!” said the expiring
sinner, who, it seems, saw both the real and polygraphic apparition,
“il y en a deux!” The surprise of the Lord Keeper was scarcely less
unpleasing at the duplication of the expected arrival; his mind misgave
him strangely. There was no neighbour who would have approached so
unceremoniously, at a time when ceremony was held in such respect. It
must be Lady Ashton, said his conscience, and followed up the hint with
an anxious anticipation of the purpose of her sudden and unannounced
return. He felt that he was caught “in the manner.” That the company
in which she had so unluckily surprised him was likely to be highly
distasteful to her, there was no question; and the only hope which
remained for him was her high sense of dignified propriety, which, he
trusted, might prevent a public explosion. But so active were his doubts
and fears as altogether to derange his purposed ceremonial for the
reception of the Marquis.

These feelings of apprehension were not confined to Sir William Ashton.
“It is my mother--it is my mother!” said Lucy, turning as pale as ashes,
and clasping her hands together as she looked at Ravenswood.

“And if it be Lady Ashton,” said her lover to her in a low tone, “what
can be the occasion of such alarm? Surely the return of a lady to
the family from which she has been so long absent should excite other
sensations than those of fear and dismay.”

“You do not know my mother,” said Miss Ashton, in a tone almost
breathless with terror; “what will she say when she sees you in this
place!”

“My stay has been too long,” said Ravenswood, somewhat haughtily, “if
her displeasure at my presence is likely to be so formidable. My dear
Lucy,” he resumed, in a tone of soothing encouragement, “you are too
childishly afraid of Lady Ashton; she is a woman of family--a lady
of fashion--a person who must know the world, and what is due to her
husband and her husband’s guests.” Lucy shook her head; and, as if
her mother, still at the distance of half a mile, could have seen and
scrutinised her deportment, she withdrew herself from beside Ravenswood,
and, taking her brother Henry’s arm, led him to a different part of the
terrace. The Keeper also shuffled down towards the portal of the great
gate, without inviting Ravenswood to accompany him; and thus he remained
standing alone on the terrace, deserted and shunned, as it were, by
the inhabitants of the mansion. This suited not the mood of one who was
proud in proportion to his poverty, and who thought that, in sacrificing
his deep-rooted resentments so far as to become Sir William Ashton’s
guest, he conferred a favour, and received none. “I can forgive Lucy,”
 he said to himself; “she is young, timid, and conscious of an important
engagement assumed without her mother’s sanction; yet she should
remember with whom it has been assumed, and leave me no reason to
suspect that she is ashamed of her choice. For the Keeper, sense,
spirit, and expression seem to have left his face and manner since he
had the first glimpse of Lady Ashton’s carriage. I must watch how this
is to end; and, if they give me reason to think myself an unwelcome
guest, my visit is soon abridged.”

With these suspicions floating on his mind, he left the terrace, and
walking towards the stables of the castle, gave directions that his
horse should be kept in readiness, in case he should have occasion to
ride abroad.

In the mean while, the drivers of the two carriages, the approach of
which had occasioned so much dismay at the castle, had become aware of
each other’s presence, as they approached upon different lines to
the head of the avenue, as a common centre. Lady Ashton’s driver and
postilions instantly received orders to get foremost, if possible, her
ladyship being desirous of despatching her first interview with her
husband before the arrival of these guests, whoever they might happen to
be. On the other hand, the coachman of the Marquis, conscious of his own
dignity and that of his master, and observing the rival charioteer was
mending his pace, resolved, like a true brother of the whip, whether
ancient or modern, to vindicate his right of precedence. So that, to
increase the confusion of the Lord Keeper’s understanding, he saw the
short time which remained for consideration abridged by the haste of the
contending coachmen, who, fixing their eyes sternly on each other, and
applying the lash smartly to their horses, began to thunder down the
descent with emulous rapidity, while the horsemen who attended them were
forced to put on to a hand-gallop.

Sir William’s only chance now remaining was the possibility of an
overturn, and that his lady or visitor might break their necks. I am
not aware that he formed any distinct wish on the subject, but I have no
reason to think that his grief in either case would have been altogether
inconsolable. This chance, however, also disappeared; for Lady Ashton,
though insensible to fear, began to see the ridicule of running a race
with a visitor of distinction, the goal being the portal of her own
castle, and commanded her coachman, as they approached the avenue, to
slacken his pace, and allow precedence to the stranger’s equipage; a
command which he gladly obeyed, as coming in time to save his honour,
the horses of the Marquis’s carriage being better, or, at least, fresher
than his own. He restrained his pace, therefore, and suffered the green
coach to enter the avenue, with all its retinue, which pass it occupied
with the speed of a whirlwind. The Marquis’s laced charioteer no
sooner found the pas d’avance was granted to him than he resumed a more
deliberate pace, at which he advanced under the embowering shade of the
lofty elms, surrounded by all the attendants; while the carriage of Lady
Ashton followed, still more slowly, at some distance.

In the front of the castle, and beneath the portal which admitted guests
into the inner court, stood Sir William Ashton, much perplexed in mind,
his younger son and daughter beside him, and in their rear a train of
attendants of various ranks, in and out of livery. The nobility and
gentry of Scotland, at this period, were remarkable even to extravagance
for the number of their servants, whose services were easily purchased
in a country where men were numerous beyond proportion to the means of
employing them.

The manners of a man trained like Sir William Ashton are too much at his
command to remain long disconcerted with the most adverse concurrence
of circumstances. He received the Marquis, as he alighted from his
equipage, with the usual compliments of welcome; and, as he ushered
him into the great hall, expressed his hope that his journey had been
pleasant. The Marquis was a tall, well-made man, with a thoughtful and
intelligent countenance, and an eye in which the fire of ambition had
for some years replaced the vivacity of youth; a bold, proud expression
of countenance, yet chastened by habitual caution, and the desire
which, as the head of a party, he necessarily entertained of acquiring
popularity. He answered with courtesy the courteous inquiries of the
Lord Keeper, and was formally presented to Miss Ashton, in the course
of which ceremony the Lord Keeper gave the first symptom of what was
chiefly occupying his mind, by introducing his daughter as “his wife,
Lady Ashton.”

Lucy blushed; the Marquis looked surprised at the extremely juvenile
appearance of his hostess, and the Lord Keeper with difficulty rallied
himself so far as to explain. “I should have said my daughter, my lord;
but the truth is, that I saw Lady Ashton’s carriage enter the avenue
shortly after your lordship’s, and----”

“Make no apology, my lord,” replied his noble guest; “let me entreat
you will wait on your lady, and leave me to cultivate Miss Ashton’s
acquaintance. I am shocked my people should have taken precedence of our
hostess at her own gate; but your lordship is aware that I supposed
Lady Ashton was still in the south. Permit me to beseech you will waive
ceremony, and hasten to welcome her.”

This was precisely what the Lord Keeper longed to do; and he instantly
profited by his lordship’s obliging permission. To see Lady Ashton, and
encounter the first burst of her displeasure in private, might prepare
her, in some degree, to receive her unwelcome guests with due decorum.
As her carriage, therefore, stopped, the arm of the attentive husband
was ready to assist Lady Ashton in dismounting. Looking as if she
saw him not, she put his arm aside, and requested that of Captain
Craigengelt, who stood by the coach with his laced hat under his arm,
having acted as cavaliere servente, or squire in attendance, during the
journey. Taking hold of this respectable person’s arm as if to support
her, Lady Ashton traversed the court, uttering a word or two by way
of direction to the servants, but not one to Sir William, who in
vain endeavoured to attract her attention, as he rather followed than
accompanied her into the hall, in which they found the Marquis in close
conversation with the Master of Ravenswood. Lucy had taken the first
opportunity of escaping. There was embarrassment on every countenance
except that of the Marquis of A----; for even Craigengelt’s impudence
was hardly able to veil his fear of Ravenswood, an the rest felt the
awkwardness of the position in which they were thus unexpectedly placed.

After waiting a moment to be presented by Sir William Ashton, the
Marquis resolved to introduce himself. “The Lord Keeper,” he said,
bowing to Lady Ashton, “has just introduced to me his daughter as his
wife; he might very easily present Lady Ashton as his daughter, so
little does she differ from what I remember her some years since. Will
she permit an old acquaintance the privilege of a guest?”

He saluted the lady with too good a grace to apprehend a repulse,
and then proceeded: “This, Lady Ashton, is a peacemaking visit,
and therefore I presume to introduce my cousin, the young Master of
Ravenswood, to your favourable notice.”

Lady Ashton could not choose but courtesy; but there was in her
obeisance an air of haughtiness approaching to contemptuous repulse.
Ravenswood could not choose but bow; but his manner returned the scorn
with which he had been greeted.

“Allow me,” she said, “to present to your lordship MY friend.”
 Craigengelt, with the forward impudence which men of his cast mistake
for ease, made a sliding bow to the Marquis, which he graced by a
flourish of his gold-laced hat. The lady turned to her husband. “You
and I, Sir William,” she said, and these were the first words she had
addressed to him, “have acquired new acquaintances since we parted; let
me introduce the acquisition I have made to mine--Captain Craigengelt.”

Another bow, and another flourish of the gold-laced hat, which was
returned by the Lord Keeper without intimation of former recognition,
and with that sort of anxious readiness which intimated his wish that
peace and amnesty should take place betwixt the contending parties,
including the auxiliaries on both sides. “Let me introduce you to the
Master of Ravenswood,” said he to Captain Craigengelt, following up the
same amicable system.

But the Master drew up his tall form to the full extent of his height,
and without so much as looking towards the person thus introduced to
him, he said, in a marked tone: “Captain Craigengelt and I are already
perfectly well acquainted with each other.”

“Perfectly--perfectly,” replied the Captain, in a mumbling tone, like
that of a double echo, and with a flourish of his hat, the circumference
of which was greatly abridged, compared with those which had so
cordially graced his introduction to the Marquis and the Lord Keeper.

Lockhard, followed by three menials, now entered with wine and
refreshments, which it was the fashion to offer as a whet before dinner;
and when they were placed before the guests, Lady Ashton made an apology
for withdrawing her husband from them for some minutes upon business of
special import. The Marquis, of course, requested her ladyship would lay
herself under no restraint; and Craigengelt, bolting with speed a second
glass of racy canary, hastened to leave the room, feeling no great
pleasure in the prospect of being left alone with the Marquis of A----
and the Master of Ravenswood; the presence of the former holding him in
awe, and that of the latter in bodily terror.

Some arrangements about his horse and baggage formed the pretext for
his sudden retreat, in which he persevered, although Lady Ashton gave
Lockhard orders to be careful most particularly to accommodate Captain
Craigengelt with all the attendance which he could possibly require. The
Marquis and the Master of Ravenswood were thus left to communicate to
each other their remarks upon the reception which they had met with,
while Lady Ashton led the way, and her lord followed somewhat like a
condemned criminal, to her ladyship’s dressing-room.

So soon as the spouses had both entered, her ladyship gave way to that
fierce audacity of temper which she had with difficulty suppressed, out
of respect to appearances. She shut the door behind the alarmed Lord
Keeper, took the key out of the spring-lock, and with a countenance
which years had not bereft of its haughty charms, and eyes which spoke
at once resolution and resentment, she addressed her astounded husband
in these words: “My lord, I am not greatly surprised at the connexions
you have been pleased to form during my absence, they are entirely in
conformity with your birth and breeding; and if I did expect anything
else, I heartily own my error, and that I merit, by having done so, the
disappointment you had prepared for me.”

“My dear Lady Ashton--my dear Eleanor [Margaret],” said the Lord Keeper,
“listen to reason for a moment, and I will convince you I have acted
with all the regard due to the dignity, as well as the interest, of my
family.”

“To the interest of YOUR family I conceive you perfectly capable of
attending,” returned the indignant lady, “and even to the dignity of
your own family also, as far as it requires any looking after. But as
mine happens to be inextricably involved with it, you will excuse me if
I choose to give my own attention so far as that is concerned.”

“What would you have, Lady Ashton?” said the husband. “What is it that
displeases you? Why is it that, on your return after so long an absence,
I am arraigned in this manner?” “Ask your own conscience, Sir William,
what has prompted you to become a renegade to your political party and
opinions, and led you, for what I know, to be on the point of marrying
your only daughter to a beggarly Jacobite bankrupt, the inveterate enemy
of your family to the boot.”

“Why, what, in the name of common sense and common civility, would you
have me do, madam?” answered her husband. “Is it possible for me, with
ordinary decency, to turn a young gentleman out of my house, who saved
my daughter’s life and my own, but the other morning, as it were?”

“Saved your life! I have heard of that story,” said the lady. “The Lord
Keeper was scared by a dun cow, and he takes the young fellow who killed
her for Guy of Warwick: any butcher from Haddington may soon have an
equal claim on your hospitality.”

“Lady Ashton,” stammered the Keeper, “this is intolerable; and when I am
desirous, too, to make you easy by any sacrifice, if you would but tell
me what you would be at.”

“Go down to your guests,” said the imperious dame, “and make your
apology to Ravenswood, that the arrival of Captain Craigengelt and some
other friends renders it impossible for you to offer him lodgings at the
castle. I expect young Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw.”

“Good heavens, madam!” ejaculated her husband. “Ravenswood to give place
to Craigengelt, a common gambler and an informer! It was all I could do
to forbear desiring the fellow to get out of my house, and I was much
surprised to see him in your ladyship’s train.”

“Since you saw him there, you might be well assured,” answered this meek
helpmate, “that he was proper society. As to this Ravenswood, he only
meets with the treatment which, to my certain knowledge, he gave to a
much-valued friend of mine, who had the misfortune to be his guest some
time since. But take your resolution; for, if Ravenswood does not quit
the house, I will.”

Sir William Ashton paced up and down the apartment in the most
distressing agitation; fear, and shame, and anger contending against the
habitual deference he was in the use of rendering to his lady. At length
it ended, as is usual with timid minds placed in such circumstances, in
his adopting a mezzo termine--a middle measure.

“I tell you frankly, madam, I neither can nor will be guilty of the
incivility you propose to the Master of Ravenswood; he has not deserved
it at my hand. If you will be so unreasonable as to insult a man of
quality under your own roof, I cannot prevent you; but I will not at
least be the agent in such a preposterous proceeding.”

“You will not?” asked the lady.

“No, by heavens, madam!” her husband replied; “ask me anything congruent
with common decency, as to drop his acquaintance by degrees, or the
like; but to bid him leave my house is what I will nto and cannot
consent to.”

“Then the task of supporting the honour of the family will fall on me,
as it has often done before,” said the lady.

She sat down, and hastily wrote a few lines. The Lord Keeper made
another effort to prevent her taking a step so decisive, just as she
opened the door to call her female attendant from the ante-room. “Think
what you are doing, Lady Ashton: you are making a mortal enemy of a
young man who is like to have the means of harming us----”

“Did you ever know a Douglas who feared an enemy?” answered the lady,
contemptuously.

“Ay, but he is as proud and vindictive as an hundred Douglasses, and an
hundred devils to boot. Think of it for a night only.”

“Not for another moment,” answered the lady. “Here, Mrs. Patullo, give
this billet to young Ravenswood.”

“To the Master, madam!” said Mrs. Patullo.

“Ay, to the Master, if you call him so.”

“I wash my hands of it entirely,” said the Keeper; “and I shall go down
into the garden, and see that Jardine gathers the winter fruit for the
dessert.”

“Do so,” said the lady, looking after him with glances of infinite
contempt; “and thank God that you leave one behind you as fit to protect
the honour of the family as you are to look after pippins and pears.”

The Lord Keeper remained long enough in the garden to give her
ladyship’s mind time to explode, and to let, as he thought, at least the
first violence of Ravenswood’s displeasure blow over. When he entered
the hall, he found the Marquis of A---- giving orders to some of his
attendants. He seemed in high displeasure, and interrupted an apology
which Sir William had commenced for having left his lordship alone.

“I presume, Sir William, you are no stranger to this singular billet
with which MY kinsman of Ravenswood (an emphasis on the word ‘my’) has
been favoured by your lady; and, of course, that you are prepared
to receive my adieus. My kinsman is already gone, having thought it
unnecessary to offer any on his part, since all former civilities had
been cancelled by this singular insult.”

“I protest, my lord,” said Sir William, holding the billet in his hand,
“I am not privy to the contents of this letter. I know Lady Ashton is
a warm-tempered and prejudiced woman, and I am sincerely sorry for any
offence that has been given or taken; but I hope your lordship will
consider that a lady----”

“Should bear herself towards persons of a certain rank with the breeding
of one,” said the Marquis, completing the half-uttered sentence.

“True, my lord,” said the unfortunate Keeper; “but Lady Ashton is still
a woman----”

“And, as such, methinks,” said the Marquis, again interrupting him,
“should be taught the duties which correspond to her station. But
here she comes, and I will learn from her own mouth the reason of this
extraordinary and unexpected affront offered to my near relation, while
both he and I were her ladyship’s guests.”

Lady Ashton accordingly entered the apartment at this moment. Her
dispute with Sir William, and a subsequent interview with her daughter,
had not prevented her from attending to the duties of her toilette. She
appeared in full dress; and, from the character of her countenance and
manner, well became the splendour with which ladies of quality then
appeared on such occasions.

The Marquis of A---- bowed haughtily, and she returned the salute with
equal pride and distance of demeanour. He then took from the passive
hand of Sir William Ashton the billet he had given him the moment before
he approached the lady, and was about to speak, when she interrupted
him. “I perceive, my lord, you are about to enter upon an unpleasant
subject. I am sorry any such should have occurred at this time, to
interrupt in the slightest degree the respectful reception due to your
lordship; but so it is. Mr. Edgar Ravenswood, for whom I have addressed
the billet in your lordship’s hand, has abused the hospitality of this
family, and Sir William Ashton’s softness of temper, in order to seduce
a young person into engagements without her parents’ consent, and of
which they never can approve.”

Both gentlemen answered at once. “My kinsman is incapable----” said the
Lord Marquis.

“I am confident that my daughter Lucy is still more incapable----” said
the Lord Keeper.

Lady Ashton at once interrupted and replied to them both: “My Lord
Marquis, your kinsman, if Mr. Ravenswood has the honour to be so, has
made the attempt privately to secure the affections of this young and
inexperienced girl. Sir William Ashton, your daughter has been simple
enough to give more encouragement than she ought to have done to so very
improper a suitor.”

“And I think, madam,” said the Lord Keeper, losing his accustomed temper
and patience, “that if you had nothing better to tell us, you had better
have kept this family secret to yourself also.”

“You will pardon me, Sir William,” said the lady, calmly; “the noble
Marquis has a right to know the cause of the treatment I have found it
necessary to use to a gentleman whom he calls his blood-relation.”

“It is a cause,” muttered the Lord Keeper, “which has emerged since the
effect has taken place; for, if it exists at all, I am sure she knew
nothing of it when her letter to Ravenswood was written.”

“It is the first time that I have heard of this,” said the Marquis;
“but, since your ladyship has tabled a subject so delicate, permit me
to say, that my kinsman’s birth and connexions entitled him to a patient
hearing, and at least a civil refusal, even in case of his being so
ambitious as to raise his eyes to the daughter of Sir William Ashton.”

“You will recollect, my lord, of what blood Miss Lucy Ashton is come by
the mother’s side,” said the lady.

“I do remember your descent--from a younger branch of the house of
Angus,” said the Marquis; “and your ladyship--forgive me, lady--ought
not to forget that the Ravenswoods have thrice intermarried with the
main stem. Come, madam, I know how matters stand--old and long-fostered
prejudices are difficult to get over, I make every allowance for them; I
ought not, and I would not, otherwise have suffered my kinsman to depart
alone, expelled, in a manner, from this house, but I had hopes of being
a mediator. I am still unwilling to leave you in anger, and shall not
set forward till after noon, as I rejoin the Master of Ravenswood upon
the road a few miles from hence. Let us talk over this matter more
coolly.”

“It is what I anxiously desire, my lord,” said Sir William Ashton,
eagerly. “Lady Ashton, we will not permit my Lord of A---- to leave us
in displeasure. We must compel him to tarry dinner at the castle.”

“The castle,” said the lady, “and all that it contains, are at the
command of the Marquis, so long as he chooses to honour it with his
residence; but touching the farther discussion of this disagreeable
topic----”

“Pardon me, good madam,” said the Marquis; “but I cannot allow you to
express any hasty resolution on a subject so important. I see that more
company is arriving; and, since I have the good fortune to renew my
former acquaintance with Lady Ashton, I hope she will give me leave to
avoid perilling what I prize so highly upon any disagreeable subject of
discussion--at least till we have talked over more pleasant topics.”

The lady smiled, courtesied, and gave her hand to the Marquis, by whom,
with all the formal gallantry of the time, which did not permit the
guest to tuck the lady of the house under the arm, as a rustic does his
sweetheart at a wake, she was ushered to the eating-room.

Here they were joined by Bucklaw, Craigengelt, and other neighbours,
whom the Lord Keeper had previously invited to meet the Marquis of
A----. An apology, founded upon a slight indisposition, was alleged
as an excuse for the absence of Miss Ashton, whose seat appeared
unoccupied. The entertainment was splendid to profusion, and was
protracted till a late hour.




CHAPTER XXIII.

     Such was our fallen father’s fate,
     Yet better than mine own;
     He shared his exile with his mate,
     I’m banish’d forth alone.

     WALLER

I WILL not attempt to describe the mixture of indignation and regret
with which Ravenswood left the seat which had belonged to his ancestors.
The terms in which Lady Ashton’s billet was couched rendered it
impossible for him, without being deficient in that spirit of which he
perhaps had too much, to remain an instant longer within its walls.
The Marquis, who had his share in the affront, was, nevertheless, still
willing to make some efforts at conciliation. He therefore suffered his
kinsman to depart alone, making him promise, however, that he would wait
for him at the small inn called the Tod’s Hole, situated, as our readers
may be pleased to recollect, half-way betwixt Ravenswood Castle and
Wolf’s Crag, and about five Scottish miles distant from each. Here the
Marquis proposed to join the Master of Ravenswood, either that night or
the next morning. His own feelings would have induced him to have left
the castle directly, but he was loth to forfeit, without at least one
effort, the advantages which he had proposed from his visit to the Lord
Keeper; and the Master of Ravenswood was, even in the very heat of his
resentment, unwilling to foreclose any chance of reconciliation which
might arise out of the partiality which Sir William Ashton had shown
towards him, as well as the intercessory arguments of his noble kinsman.
He himself departed without a moment’s delay, farther than was necessary
to make this arrangement.

At first he spurred his horse at a quick pace through an avenue of the
park, as if, by rapidity of motion, he could stupify the confusion of
feelings with which he was assailed. But as the road grew wilder and
more sequestered, and when the trees had hidden the turrets of the
castle, he gradually slackened his pace, as if to indulge the painful
reflections which he had in vain endeavoured to repress. The path in
which he found himself led him to the Mermaiden’s Fountain, and to the
cottage of Alice; and the fatal influence which superstitious belief
attached to the former spot, as well as the admonitions which had
been in vain offered to him by the inhabitant of the latter, forced
themselves upon his memory. “Old saws speak truth,” he said to himself,
“and the Mermaiden’s Well has indeed witnessed the last act of rashness
of the heir of Ravenswood. Alice spoke well,” he continued, “and I am
in the situation which she foretold; or rather, I am more deeply
dishonoured--not the dependant and ally of the destroyer of my father’s
house, as the old sibyl presaged, but the degraded wretch who has
aspired to hold that subordinate character, and has been rejected with
disdain.”

We are bound to tell the tale as we have received it; and, considering
the distance of the time, and propensity of those through whose mouths
it has passed to the marvellous, this could not be called a Scottish
story unless it manifested a tinge of Scottish superstition. As
Ravenswood approached the solitary fountain, he is said to have met with
the following singular adventure: His horse, which was moving slowly
forward, suddenly interrupted its steady and composed pace, snorted,
reared, and, though urged by the spur, refused to proceed, as if some
object of terror had suddenly presented itself. On looking to the
fountain, Ravenswood discerned a female figure, dressed in a white, or
rather greyish, mantle, placed on the very spot on which Lucy Ashton
had reclined while listening to the fatal tale of love. His immediate
impression was that she had conjectured by which path he would traverse
the park on his departure, and placed herself at this well-known and
sequestered place of rendezvous, to indulge her own sorrow and his
parting interview. In this belief he jumped from his horse, and,
making its bridle fast to a tree, walked hastily towards the
fountain, pronouncing eagerly, yet under his breath, the words, “Miss
Ashton!--Lucy!”

The figure turned as he addressed it, and displayed to his wondering
eyes the features, not of Lucy Ashton, but of old blind Alice. The
singularity of her dress, which rather resembled a shroud than the
garment of a living woman; the appearance of her person, larger, as
it struck him, than it usually seemed to be; above all, the strange
circumstance of a blind, infirm, and decrepit person being found alone
and at a distance from her habitation (considerable, if her infirmities
be taken into account), combined to impress him with a feeling of wonder
approaching to fear. As he approached, she arose slowly from her seat,
held her shrivelled hand up as if to prevent his coming more near,
and her withered lips moved fast, although no sound issued from them.
Ravenswood stopped; and as, after a moment’s pause, he again advanced
towards her, Alice, or her apparition, moved or glided backwards towards
the thicket, still keeping her face turned towards him. The trees soon
hid the form from his sight; and, yielding to the strong and terrific
impression that the being which he had seen was not of this world, the
Master of Ravenswood remained rooted to the ground whereon he had
stood when he caught his last view of her. At length, summoning up his
courage, he advanced to the spot on which the figure had seemed to
be seated; but neither was there pressure of the grass nor any other
circumstance to induce him to believe that what he had seen was real and
substantial.

Full of those strange thoughts and confused apprehensions which awake
in the bosom of one who conceives he has witnessed some preternatural
appearance, the Master of Ravenswood walked back towards his horse,
frequently, however, looking behind him, not without apprehension, as if
expecting that the vision would reappear. But the apparition, whether
it was real or whether it was the creation of a heated and agitated
imagination, returned not again; and he found his horse sweating and
terrified, as if experiencing that agony of fear with which the presence
of a supernatural being is supposed to agitate the brute creation. The
Master mounted, and rode slowly forward, soothing his steed from time
to time, while the animal seemed internally to shrink and shudder, as
if expecting some new object of fear at the opening of every glade.
The rider, after a moment’s consideration, resolved to investigate the
matter further. “Can my eyes have deceived me,” he said, “and deceived
me for such a space of time? Or are this woman’s infirmities but
feigned, in order to excite compassion? And even then, her motion
resembled not that of a living and existing person. Must I adopt the
popular creed, and think that the unhappy being has formed a league with
the powers of darkness? I am determined to be resolved; I will not brook
imposition even from my own eyes.”

In this uncertainty he rode up to the little wicket of Alice’s garden.
Her seat beneath the birch-tree was vacant, though the day was pleasant
and the sun was high. He approached the hut, and heard from within the
sobs and wailing of a female. No answer was returned when he knocked,
so that, after a moment’s pause, he lifted the latch and entered. It
was indeed a house of solitude and sorrow. Stretched upon her miserable
pallet lay the corpse of the last retainer of the house of Ravenswood
who still abode on their paternal domains! Life had but shortly
departed; and the little girl by whom she had been attended in her last
moments was wringing her hands and sobbing, betwixt childish fear and
sorrow, over the body of her mistress.

The Master of Ravenswood had some difficulty to compose the terrors
of the poor child, whom his unexpected appearance had at first rather
appalled than comforted; and when he succeeded, the first expression
which the girl used intimated that “he had come too late.” Upon
inquiring the meaning of this expression, he learned that the deceased,
upon the first attack of the mortal agony, had sent a peasant to the
castle to beseech an interview of the Master of Ravenswood, and had
expressed the utmost impatience for his return. But the messengers of
the poor are tardy and negligent: the fellow had not reached the castle,
as was afterwards learned, until Ravenswood had left it, and had then
found too much amusement among the retinue of the strangers to return in
any haste to the cottage of Alice. Meantime her anxiety of mind seemed
to increase with the agony of her body; and, to use the phrase of
Babie, her only attendant, “she prayed powerfully that she might see
her master’s son once more, and renew her warning.” She died just as the
clock in the distant village tolled one; and Ravenswood remembered, with
internal shuddering, that he had heard the chime sound through the wood
just before he had seen what he was now much disposed to consider as the
spectre of the deceased.

It was necessary, as well from his respect to the departed as in common
humanity to her terrified attendant, that he should take some measures
to relieve the girl from her distressing situation. The deceased,
he understood, had expressed a desire to be buried in a solitary
churchyard, near the little inn of the Tod’s Hole, called the Hermitage,
or more commonly Armitage, in which lay interred some of the Ravenswood
family, and many of their followers. Ravenswood conceived it his duty
to gratify this predilection, commonly found to exist among the Scottish
peasantry, and despatched Babie to the neighbouring village to procure
the assistance of some females, assuring her that, in the mean while, he
would himself remain with the dead body, which, as in Thessaly of old,
it is accounted highly unfit to leave without a watch.

Thus, in the course of a quarter of an hour or little more, he found
himself sitting a solitary guard over the inanimate corpse of her whose
dismissed spirit, unless his eyes had strangely deceived him, had so
recently manifested itself before him. Notwithstanding his natural
courage, the Master was considerably affected by a concurrence of
circumstances so extraordinary. “She died expressing her eager desire
to see me. Can it be, then,” was his natural course of reflection--“can
strong and earnest wishes, formed during the last agony of nature,
survive its catastrophe, surmount the awful bounds of the spiritual
world, and place before us its inhabitants in the hues and colouring of
life? And why was that manifested to the eye which could not unfold its
tale to the ear? and wherefore should a breach be made in the laws
of nature, yet its purpose remain unknown? Vain questions, which only
death, when it shall make me like the pale and withered form before me,
can ever resolve.”

He laid a cloth, as he spoke, over the lifeless face, upon whose
features he felt unwilling any longer to dwell. He then took his place
in an old carved oaken chair, ornamented with his own armorial bearings,
which Alice had contrived to appropriate to her own use in the pillage
which took place among creditors, officers, domestics, and messengers of
the law when his father left Ravenswood Castle for the last time. Thus
seated, he banished, as much as he could, the superstitious feelings
which the late incident naturally inspired. His own were sad enough,
without the exaggeration of supernatural terror, since he found himself
transferred from the situation of a successful lover of Lucy Ashton, and
an honoured and respected friend of her father, into the melancholy
and solitary guardian of the abandoned and forsaken corpse of a common
pauper.

He was relieved, however, from his sad office sooner that he could
reasonably have expected, considering the distance betwixt the hut of
the deceased and the village, and the age and infirmities of three old
women who came from thence, in military phrase, to relieve guard upon
the body of the defunct. On any other occasion the speed of these
reverend sibyls would have been much more moderate, for the first was
eighty years of age and upwards, the second was paralytic, and the third
lame of a leg from some accident. But the burial duties rendered to the
deceased are, to the Scottish peasant of either sex, a labour of love.
I know not whether it is from the temper of the people, grave and
enthusiastic as it certainly is, or from the recollection of the ancient
Catholic opinions, when the funeral rites were always considered as a
period of festival to the living; but feasting, good cheer, and even
inebriety, were, and are, the frequent accompaniments of a Scottish
old-fashioned burial. What the funeral feast, or “dirgie,” as it is
called, was to the men, the gloomy preparations of the dead body for the
coffin were to the women. To straight the contorted limbs upon a board
used for that melancholy purpose, to array the corpse in clean linen,
and over that in its woollen shroad, were operations committed always to
the old matrons of the village, and in which they found a singular and
gloomy delight.

The old women paid the Master their salutations with a ghastly smile,
which reminded him of the meeting betwixt Macbeth and the witches on
the blasted heath of Forres. He gave them some money, and recommended to
them the charge of the dead body of their contemporary, an office which
they willingly undertook; intimating to him at the same time that
he must leave the hut, in order that they might begin their mournful
duties. Ravenswood readily agreed to depart, only tarrying to recommend
to them due attention to the body, and to receive information where
he was to find the sexton, or beadle, who had in charge the deserted
churchyard of the Armitage, in order to prepare matters for the
reception of Old Alice in the place of repose which she had selected for
herself.

“Ye’ll no be pinched to find out Johnie Mortsheugh,” said the elder
sibyl, and still her withered cheek bore a grisly smile; “he dwells near
the Tod’s Hole, an house of entertainment where there has been mony a
blythe birling, for death and drink-draining are near neighbours to ane
anither.”

“Ay! and that’s e’en true, cummer,” said the lame hag, propping herself
with a crutch which supported the shortness of her left leg, “for I mind
when the father of this Master of Ravenswood that is now standing before
us sticked young Blackhall with his whinger, for a wrang word said ower
their wine, or brandy, or what not: he gaed in as light as a lark, and
he came out wi’ his feet foremost. I was at the winding of the corpse;
and when the bluid was washed off, he was a bonny bouk of man’s body.”
 It may be easily believed that this ill-timed anecdote hastened the
Master’s purpose of quitting a company so evil-omened and so odious.
Yet, while walking to the tree to which his horse was tied, and busying
himself with adjusting the girths of the saddle, he could not avoid
hearing, through the hedge of the little garden, a conversation
respecting himself, betwixt the lame woman and the octogenarian sibyl.
The pair had hobbled into the garden to gather rosemary, southernwood,
rue, and other plants proper to be strewed upon the body, and burned by
way of fumigation in the chimney of the cottage. The paralytic wretch,
almost exhausted by the journey, was left guard upon the corpse, lest
witches or fiends might play their sport with it.

The following law, croaking dialogue was necessarily overheard by the
Master of Ravenswood:

“That’s a fresh and full-grown hemlock, Annie Winnie; mony a cummer lang
syne wad hae sought nae better horse to flee over hill and how, through
mist and moonlight, and light down in the King of France’s cellar.”

“Ay, cummer! but the very deil has turned as hard-hearted now as the
Lord Keeper and the grit folk, that hae breasts like whinstane. They
prick us and they pine us, and they pit us on the pinnywinkles for
witches; and, if I say my prayers backwards ten times ower, Satan will
never gie me amends o’ them.”

“Did ye ever see the foul thief?” asked her neighbour.

“Na!” replied the other spokeswoman; “but I trow I hae dreamed of him
mony a time, and I think the day will come they will burn me for’t. But
ne’er mind, cummer! we hae this dollar of the Master’s, and we’ll send
doun for bread and for yill, and tobacco, and a drap brandy to burn, and
a wee pickle saft sugar; and be there deil, or nae deil, lass, we’ll hae
a merry night o’t.”

Here her leathern chops uttered a sort of cackling, ghastly laugh,
resembling, to a certain degree, the cry of the screech-owl.

“He’s a frank man, and a free-handed man, the Master,” said Annie
Winnie, “and a comely personage--broad in the shouthers, and narrow
around the lunyies. He wad mak a bonny corpse; I wad like to hae the
streiking and winding o’ him.”

“It is written on his brow, Annie Winnie,” returned the octogenarian,
her companion, “that hand of woman, or of man either, will never
straught him: dead-deal will never be laid on his back, make you your
market of that, for I hae it frae a sure hand.”

“Will it be his lot to die on the battle-ground then, Ailsie Gourlay?
Will he die by the sword or the ball, as his forbears had dune before
him, mony ane o’ them?” “Ask nae mair questions about it--he’ll no be
graced sae far,” replied the sage.

“I ken ye are wiser than ither folk, Aislie Gourlay. But wha tell’d ye
this?” “Fashna your thumb about that, Annie Winnie,” answered the sibyl,
“I hae it frae a hand sure eneugh.”

“But ye said ye never saw the foul thief,” reiterated her inquisitive
companion.

“I hae it frae as sure a hand,” said Ailsie, “and frae them that spaed
his fortune before the sark gaed ower his head.”

“Hark! I hear his horse’s feet riding aff,” said the other; “they dinna
sound as if good luck was wi’ them.”

“Mak haste, sirs,” cried the paralytic hag from the cottage, “and let
us do what is needfu’, and say what is fitting; for, if the dead corpse
binna straughted, it will girn and thraw, and that will fear the best o’
us.”

Ravenswood was now out of hearing. He despised most of the ordinary
prejudices about witchcraft, omens, and vaticination, to which his age
and country still gave such implicit credit that to express a doubt of
them was accounted a crime equal to the unbelief of Jews or Saracens; he
knew also that the prevailing belief, concerning witches, operating
upon the hypochondriac habits of those whom age, infirmity, and poverty
rendered liable to suspicion, and enforced by the fear of death and the
pangs of the most cruel tortures, often extorted those confessions which
encumber and disgrace the criminal records of Scotland during the 17th
century. But the vision of that morning, whether real or imaginary,
had impressed his mind with a superstitious feeling which he in vain
endeavoured to shake off. The nature of the business which awaited him
at the little inn, called Tod’s Hole, where he soon after arrived, was
not of a kind to restore his spirits.

It was necessary he should see Mortsheugh, the sexton of the old
burial-ground at Armitage, to arrange matters for the funeral of Alice;
and, as the man dwelt near the place of her late residence, the Master,
after a slight refreshment, walked towards the place where the body of
Alice was to be deposited. It was situated in the nook formed by the
eddying sweep of a stream, which issued from the adjoining hills. A rude
cavern in an adjacent rock, which, in the interior, was cut into the
shape of a cross, formed the hermitage, where some Saxon saint had in
ancient times done penance, and given name to the place. The rich
Abbey of Coldinghame had, in latter days, established a chapel in
the neighbourhood, of which no vestige was now visible, though the
churchyard which surrounded it was still, as upon the present occasion,
used for the interment of particular persons. One or two shattered
yew-trees still grew within the precincts of that which had once been
holy ground. Warriors and barons had been buried there of old, but
their names were forgotten, and their monuments demolished. The only
sepulchral memorials which remained were the upright headstones which
mark the graves of persons of inferior rank. The abode of the sexton was
a solitary cottage adjacent to the ruined wall of the cemetery, but so
low that, with its thatch, which nearly reached the ground, covered with
a thick crop of grass, fog, and house-leeks, it resembled an overgrown
grave. On inquiry, however, Ravenswood found that the man of the last
mattock was absent at a bridal, being fiddler as well as grave-digger to
the vicinity. He therefore retired to the little inn, leaving a message
that early next morning he would again call for the person whose double
occupation connected him at once with the house of mourning and the
house of feasting.

An outrider of the Marquis arrived at Tod’s Hole shortly after, with a
message, intimating that his master would join Ravenswood at that place
on the following morning; and the Master, who would otherwise have
proceeded to his old retreat at Wolf’s Crag, remained there accordingly
to give meeting to his noble kinsman.

     Hamlet, Act V. Scene 1.

THE sleep of Ravenswood was broken by ghastly and agitating visions, and
his waking intervals disturbed by melancholy reflections on the past and
painful anticipations of the future. He was perhaps the only traveller
who ever slept in that miserable kennel without complaining of his
lodgings, or feeling inconvenience from their deficiencies. It is when
“the mind is free the body’s delicate.” Morning, however, found the
Master an early riser, in hopes that the fresh air of the dawn might
afford the refreshment which night had refused him. He took his way
towards the solitary burial-ground, which lay about half a mile from the
inn.

The thin blue smoke, which already began to curl upward, and to
distinguish the cottage of the living from the habitation of the dead,
apprised him that its inmate had returned and was stirring. Accordingly,
on entering the little churchyard, he saw the old man labouring in a
half-made grave. “My destiny,” thought Ravenswood, “seems to lead me to
scenes of fate and of death; but these are childish thoughts, and they
shall not master me. I will not again suffer my imagination to beguile
my senses.” The old man rested on his spade as the Master approached
him, as if to receive his commands; and as he did not immediately speak,
the sexton opened the discourse in his own way.

“Ye will be a wedding customer, sir, I’se warrant?”

“What makes you think so, friend?” replied the Master.

“I live by twa trades, sir,” replied the blythe old man--“fiddle, sir,
and spade; filling the world, and emptying of it; and I suld ken baith
cast of customers by head-mark in thirty years’ practice.”

“You are mistaken, however, this morning,” replied Ravenswood.

“Am I?” said the old man, looking keenly at him, “troth and it may be;
since, for as brent as your brow is, there is something sitting upon it
this day that is as near akin to death as to wedlock. Weel--weel; the
pick and shovel are as ready to your order as bow and fiddle.”

“I wish you,” said Ravenswood, “to look after the decent interment
of an old woman, Alice Gray, who lived at the Graigfoot in Ravenswood
Park.”

“Alice Gray!--blind Alice!” said the sexton; “and is she gane at last?
that’s another jow of the bell to bid me be ready. I mind when Habbie
Gray brought her down to this land; a likely lass she was then,
and looked ower her southland nose at us a’. I trow her pride got a
downcome. And is she e’en gane?”

“She died yesterday,” said Ravenswood; “and desired to be buried here
beside her husband; you know where he lies, no doubt?”

“Ken where he lies!” answered the sexton, with national indirection of
response. “I ken whar a’body lies, that lies here. But ye were speaking
o’ her grave? Lord help us, it’s no an ordinar grave that will haud her
in, if a’s true that folk said of Alice in her auld days; and if I gae
to six feet deep--and a warlock’s grave shouldna be an inch mair ebb,
or her ain witch cummers would soon whirl her out of her shroud for a’
their auld acquaintance--and be’t six feet, or be’t three, wha’s to pay
the making o’t, I pray ye?”

“I will pay that, my friend, and all other reasonable charges.”

“Reasonable charges!” said the sexton; “ou, there’s grundmail--and
bell-siller, though the bell’s broken, nae doubt--and the kist--and my
day’s wark--and my bit fee--and some brandy and yill to the dirgie, I am
no thinking that you can inter her, to ca’ decently, under saxteen pund
Scots.”

“There is the money, my friend,” said Ravenswood, “and something over.
Be sure you know the grave.”

“Ye’ll be ane o’ her English relations, I’se warrant,” said the hoary
man of skulls; “I hae heard she married far below her station. It was
very right to let her bite on the bridle when she was living, and it’s
very right to gie her a decent burial now she’s dead, for that’s a
matter o’ credit to yoursell rather than to her. Folk may let their
kindred shift for themsells when they are alive, and can bear the burden
of their ain misdoings; but it’s an unnatural thing to let them be
buried like dogs, when a’ the discredit gangs to the kindred. What kens
the dead corpse about it?”

“You would not have people neglect their relations on a bridal occasion
neither?” said Ravenswood, who was amused with the professional
limitation of the grave-digger’s philanthropy.

The old man cast up his sharp grey eyes with a shrewd smile, as if he
understood the jest, but instantly continued, with his former gravity:
“Bridals--wha wad neglect bridals that had ony regard for plenishing
the earth? To be sure, they suld be celebrated with all manner of good
cheer, and meeting of friends, and musical instruments--harp,
sackbut, and psaltery; or gude fiddle and pipes, when these auld-warld
instruments of melody are hard to be compassed.”

“The presence of the fiddle, I dare say,” replied Ravenswood, “would
atone for the absence of all the others.”

The sexton again looked sharply up at him, as he answered. “Nae
doubt--nae doubt, if it were weel played; but yonder,” he said, as if
to change the discourse, “is Halbert Gray’s lang hame, that ye were
speering after, just the third bourock beyond the muckle through-stane
that stands on sax legs yonder, abune some ane of the Ravenswoods; for
there is mony of their kin and followers here, deil lift them! though it
isna just their main burial-place.”

“They are no favourites, then, of yours, these Ravenswoods?” said the
Master, no much pleased with the passing benediction which was thus
bestowed on his family and name.

“I kenna wha should favour them,” said the grave-digger; “when they
had lands and power, they were ill guides of them baith, and now their
head’s down, there’s few care how lang they may be of lifting it again.”

“Indeed!” said Ravenswood; “I never heard that this unhappy family
deserved ill-will at the hands of their country. I grant their poverty,
if that renders them contemptible.”

“It will gang a far way till’t” said the sexton of Hermitage, “ye may
tak my word for that; at least, I ken naething else that suld mak myself
contemptible, and folk are far frae respecting me as they wad do if I
lived in a twa-lofted sclated house. But as for the Ravenswoods, I hae
seen three generations of them, and deil ane to mend other.”

“I thought they had enjoyed a fair character in the country,” said their
descendant.

“Character! Ou, ye see, sir,” said the sexton, “as for the auld gudesire
body of a lord, I lived on his land when I was a swanking young chield,
and could hae blawn the trumpet wi’ ony body, for I had wind eneugh
then; and touching this trumpeter Marine that I have heard play afore
the lords of the circuit, I wad hae made nae mair o’ him than of a bairn
and a bawbee whistle. I defy him to hae played ‘Boot and saddle,’
or ‘Horse and away,’ or ‘Gallants, come trot,’ with me; he hadna the
tones.”

“But what is all this to old Lord Ravenswood, my friend?” said the
Master, who, with an anxiety not unnatural in his circumstances, was
desirous of prosecuting the musician’s first topic--“what had his memory
to do with the degeneracy of the trumpet music?”

“Just this, sir,” answered the sexton, “that I lost my wind in his
service. Ye see I was trumpeter at the castle, and had allowance for
blawing at break of day, and at dinner time, and other whiles when
there was company about, and it pleased my lord; and when he raised his
militia to caper awa’ to Bothwell Brig against the wrang-headed westland
Whigs, I behoved, reason or name, to munt a horse and caper awa’ wi’
them.”

“And very reasonable,” said Ravenswood; “you were his servant and
vassal.”

“Servitor, say ye?” replied the sexton, “and so I was; but it was to
blaw folk to their warm dinner, or at the warst to a decent kirkyard,
and no to skirl them awa’ to a bluidy braeside, where there was deil a
bedral but the hooded craw. But bide ye, ye shall hear what cam o’t, and
how far I am bund to be bedesman to the Ravenswoods. Till’t, ye see, we
gaed on a braw simmer morning, twenty-fourth of June, saxteen hundred
and se’enty-nine, of a’ the days of the month and year--drums beat, guns
rattled, horses kicked and trampled. Hackstoun of Rathillet keepit the
brig wi’ mustket and carabine and pike, sword and scythe for what I ken,
and we horsemen were ordered down to cross at the ford,--I hate fords
at a’ times, let abee when there’s thousands of armed men on the other
side. There was auld Ravenswood brandishing his Andrew Ferrara at the
head, and crying to us to come and buckle to, as if we had been gaun to
a fair; there was Caleb Balderstone, that is living yet, flourishing in
the rear, and swearing Gog and Magog, he would put steel through the guts
of ony man that turned bridle; there was young Allan Ravenswood, that
was then Master, wi’ a bended pistol in his hand--it was a mercy it gaed
na aff!--crying to me, that had scarce as much wind left as serve the
necessary purpose of my ain lungs, ‘Sound, you poltroon!--sound, you
damned cowardly villain, or I will blow your brains out!’ and, to be
sure, I blew sic points of war that the scraugh of a clockin-hen was
music to them.”

“Well, sir, cut all this short,” said Ravenswood.

“Short! I had like to hae been cut short mysell, in the flower of my
youth, as Scripture says; and that’s the very thing that I compleen o’.
Weel! in to the water we behoved a’ to splash, heels ower head, sit or
fa’--ae horse driving on anither, as is the way of brute beasts, and
riders that hae as little sense; the very bushes on the ither side were
a-bleeze wi’ the flashes of the Whig guns; and my horse had just taen the
grund, when a blackavised westland carle--I wad mind the face o’ him a
hundred years yet--an ee like a wild falcon’s, and a beard as broad
as my shovel--clapped the end o’ his lang black gun within a quarter’s
length of my lug! By the grace o’ Mercy, the horse swarved round, and I
fell aff at the tae side as the ball whistled by at the tither, and the
fell auld lord took the Whig such a swauk wi’ his broadsword that he
made twa pieces o’ his head, and down fell the lurdance wi’ a’ his bouk
abune me.”

“You were rather obliged to the old lord, I think,” said Ravenswood.

“Was I? my sartie! first for bringing me into jeopardy, would I nould I,
and then for whomling a chield on the tap o’ me that dang the very wind
out of my body? I hae been short-breathed ever since, and canna gang
twenty yards without peghing like a miller’s aiver.”

“You lost, then, your place as trumpeter?” said Ravenswood.

“Lost it! to be sure I lost it,” replied the sexton, “for I couldna hae
played pew upon a dry hemlock; but I might hae dune weel eneugh, for
I keepit the wage and the free house, and little to do but play on the
fiddle to them, but for Allan, last Lord Ravenswood, that was far waur
than ever his father was.”

“What,” said the Master, “did my father--I mean, did his father’s
son--this last Lord Ravenswood, deprive you of what the bounty of his
father allowed you?”

“Ay, troth did he,” answered the old man; “for he loot his affairs gang
to the dogs, and let in this Sir William Ashton on us, that will gie
naething for naething, and just removed me and a’ the puir creatures
that had bite and soup at the castle, and a hole to put our heads in,
when things were in the auld way.”

“If Lord Ravenswood protected his people, my friend, while he had the
means of doing so, I think they might spare his memory,” replied the
Master.

“Ye are welcome to your ain opinion, sir,” said the sexton; “but ye
winna persuade me that he did his duty, either to himsell or to huz puir
dependent creatures, in guiding us the gate he has done; he might hae
gien us life-rent tacks of our bits o’ houses and yards; and me, that’s
an auld man, living in yon miserable cabin, that’s fitter for the dead
than the quick, and killed wi’ rheumatise, and John Smith in my dainty
bit mailing, and his window glazen, and a’ because Ravenswood guided his
gear like a fule!”

“It is but too true,” said Ravenswood, conscience-struck; “the penalties
of extravagance extend far beyond the prodigal’s own sufferings.”
 “However,” said the sexton, “this young man Edgar is like to avenge my
wrangs on the haill of his kindred.” “Indeed?” said Ravenswood; “why
should you suppose so?”

“They say he is about to marry the daughter of Leddy Ashton; and let her
leddyship get his head ance under her oxter, and see you if she winna
gie his neck a thraw. Sorra a bit, if I were him! Let her alane for
hauding a’thing in het water that draws near her. Sae the warst wish I
shall wish the lad is, that he may take his ain creditable gate o’t, and
ally himsell wi’ his father’s enemies, that have taken his broad lands
and my bonny kail-yard from the lawful owners thereof.”

Cervantes acutely remarks, that flattery is pleasing even from the mouth
of a madman; and censure, as well as praise, often affects us, while we
despise the opinions and motives on which it is founded and expressed.
Ravenswood, abruptly reiterating his command that Alice’s funeral should
be attended to, flung away from the sexton, under the painful impression
that the great as well as the small vulgar would think of his engagement
with Lucy like this ignorant and selfish peasant.

“And I have stooped to subject myself to these calumnies, and am
rejected notwithstanding! Lucy, your faith must be true and perfect as
the diamond to compensate for the dishonour which men’s opinions, and
the conduct of your mother, attach to the heir of Ravenswood!”

As he raised his eyes, he beheld the Marquis of A----, who, having
arrived at the Tod’s Hole, had walked forth to look for his kinsman.

After mutual greetings, he made some apology to the Master for not
coming forward on the preceding evening. “It was his wish,” he said,
“to have done so, but he had come to the knowledge of some matters which
induced him to delay his purpose. I find,” he proceeded, “there has been
a love affair here, kinsman; and though I might blame you for not
having communicated with me, as being in some degree the chief of your
family----”

“With your lordship’s permission,” said Ravenswood, “I am deeply
grateful for the interest you are pleased to take in me, but _I_ am the
chief and head of my family.”

“I know it--I know it,” said the Marquis; “in a strict heraldic and
genealogical sense, you certainly are so; what I mean is, that being in
some measure under my guardianship----”

“I must take the liberty to say, my lord----” answered Ravenswood, and
the tone in which he interrupted the Marquis boded no long duration to
the friendship of the noble relatives, when he himself was interrupted
by the little sexton, who cam puffing after them, to ask if their
honours would choose music at the change-house to make up for short
cheer.

“We want no music,” said the Master, abruptly.

“Your honour disna ken what ye’re refusing, then,” said the fiddler,
with the impertinent freedom of his profession. “I can play, ‘Wilt thou
do’t again,’ and ‘The Auld Man’s Mear’s Dead,’ sax times better than
ever Patie Birnie. I’ll get my fiddle in the turning of a coffin-screw.”

“Take yourself away, sir,” said the Marquis.

“And if your honour be a north-country gentleman,” said the persevering
minstrel, “whilk I wad judge from your tongue, I can play ‘Liggeram
Cosh,’ and ‘Mullin Dhu,’ and ‘The Cummers of Athole.’”

“Take yourself away, friend; you interrupt our conversation.”

“Or if, under your honour’s favour, ye should happen to be a
thought honest, I can play (this in a low and confidential tone)
‘Killiecrankie,’ and ‘The King shall hae his ain,’ and ‘The Auld Stuarts
back again’; and the wife at the change-house is a decent, discreet
body, neither kens nor cares what toasts are drucken, and what tunes
are played, in her house: she’s deaf to a’thing but the clink o’ the
siller.”

The Marquis, who was sometimes suspected of Jacobitism, could not help
laughing as he threw the fellow a dollar, and bid him go play to the
servants if he had a mind, and leave them at peace.

“Aweel, gentlemen,” said he, “I am wishing your honours gude day. I’ll
be a’ the better of the dollar, and ye’ll be the waur of wanting music,
I’se tell ye. But I’se gang hame, and finish the grave in the tuning o’
a fiddle-string, lay by my spade, and then get my tother bread-winner,
and awa’ to your folk, and see if they hae better lugs than their
masters.”




CHAPTER XXV.

     True love, an thou be true,
     Thou has ane kittle part to play;
     For fortune, fashion, fancy, and thou,
     Maun strive for many a day.

     I’ve kend by mony a friend’s tale,
     Far better by this heart of mine,
     What time and change of fancy avail
     A true-love knot to untwine.

     HENDERSOUN.

“I WISHED to tell you, my good kinsman,” said the Marquis, “now that we
are quit of that impertinent fiddler, that I had tried to discuss this
love affair of yours with Sir William Ashton’s daughter. I never saw
the young lady but for a few minutes to-day; so, being a stranger to her
personal merits, I pay a compliment to you, and offer her no offence, in
saying you might do better.”

“My lord, I am much indebted for the interest you have taken in my
affairs,” said Ravenswood. “I did not intend to have troubled you in any
matter concerning Miss Ashton. As my engagement with that young lady has
reached your lordship, I can only say, that you must necessarily suppose
that I was aware of the objections to my marrying into her father’s
family, and of course must have been completely satisfied with the
reasons by which these objections are overbalanced, since I have
proceeded so far in the matter.”

“Nay, Master, if you had heard me out,” said his noble relation, “you
might have spared that observation; for, without questioning that you
had reasons which seemed to you to counterbalance every other obstacle,
I set myself, by every means that it became me to use towards the
Ashtons, to persuade them to meet your views.”

“I am obliged to your lordship for your unsolicited intercession,” said
Ravenswood; “especially as I am sure your lordship would never carry it
beyond the bounds which it became me to use.”

“Of that,” said the Marquis, “you may be confident; I myself felt the
delicacy of the matter too much to place a gentleman nearly connected
with my house in a degrading or dubious situation with these Ashtons.
But I pointed out all the advantages of their marrying their daughter
into a house so honourable, and so nearly related with the first of
Scotland; I explained the exact degree of relationship in which the
Ravenswoods stand to ourselves; and I even hinted how political matters
were like to turn, and what cards would be trumps next Parliament. I
said I regarded you as a son--or a nephew, or so--rather than as a more
distant relation; and that I made your affair entirely my own.”

“And what was the issue of your lordship’s explanation?” said
Ravenswood, in some doubt whether he should resent or express gratitude
for his interference.

“Why, the Lord Keeper would have listened to reason,” said the Marquis;
“he is rather unwilling to leave his place, which, in the present view
of a change, must be vacated; and, to say truth, he seemed to have
a liking for you, and to be sensible of the general advantages to be
attained by such a match. But his lady, who is tongue of the trump,
Master----”

“What of Lady Ashton, my lord?” said Ravenswood; “let me know the issue
of this extraordinary conference: I can bear it.”

“I am glad of that, kinsman,” said the Marquis, “for I am ashamed to
tell you half what she said. It is enough--her mind is made up, and the
mistress of a first-rate boarding-school could not have rejected
with more haughty indifference the suit of a half-pay Irish officer,
beseeching permission to wait upon the heiress of a West India planter,
than Lady Ashton spurned every proposal of mediation which it could at
all become me to offer in behalf of you, my good kinsman. I cannot guess
what she means. A more honourable connexion she could not form, that’s
certain. As for money and land, that used to be her husband’s business
rather than hers; I really think she hates you for having the rank
which her husband has not, and perhaps for not having the lands that her
goodman has. But I should only vex you to say more about it--here we are
at the change-house.”

The Master of Ravenswood paused as he entered the cottage, which reeked
through all its crevices, and they were not few, from the exertions of
the Marquis’s travelling-cooks to supply good cheer, and spread, as it
were, a table in the wilderness.

“My Lord Marquis,” said Ravenswood, “I already mentioned that accident
has put your lordship in possession of a secret which, with my consent,
should have remained one even to you, my kinsman, for some time. Since
the secret was to part from my own custody, and that of the only person
besides who was interested in it, I am not sorry it should have reached
your lordship’s ears, as being fully aware that you are my noble kinsman
and friend.”

“You may believe it is safely lodged with me, Master of Ravenswood,”
 said the Marquis; “but I should like well to hear you say that you
renounced the idea of an alliance which you can hardly pursue without a
certain degree of degradation.”

“Of that, my lord, I shall judge,” answered Ravenswood, “and I hope with
delicacy as sensitive as any of my friends. But I have no engagement
with Sir William and Lady Ashton. It is with Miss Ashton alone that I
have entered upon the subject, and my conduct in the matter shall be
entirely ruled by hers. If she continues to prefer me in my poverty to
the wealthier suitors whom her friends recommend, I may well make some
sacrifice to her sincere affection: I may well surrender to her the
less tangible and less palpable advantages of birth, and the deep-rooted
prejudices of family hatred. If Miss Lucy Ashton should change her mind
on a subject of such delicacy, I trust my friends will be silent on my
disappointment, and I shall know how to make my enemies so.”

“Spoke like a gallant young nobleman,” said the Marquis; “for my part, I
have that regard for you, that I should be sorry the thing went on. This
Sir William Ashton was a pretty enough pettifogging kind of a lawyer
twenty years ago, and betwixt battling at the bar and leading in
committees of Parliament he has got well on; the Darien matter lent him
a lift, for he had good intelligence and sound views, and sold out in
time; but the best work is had out of him. No government will take him
at his own, or rather his wife’s extravagant, valuation; and betwixt his
indecision and her insolence, from all I can guess, he will outsit his
market, and be had cheap when no one will bid for him. I say nothing
of Miss Ashton; but I assure you, a connexion with her father will be
neither useful nor ornamental, beyond that part of your father’s spoils
which he may be prevailed upon to disgorge by way of tocher-good; and
take my word for it, you will get more if you have spirit to bell the
cat with him in the House of Peers. And I will be the man, cousin,”
 continued his lordship, “will course the fox for you, and make him rue
the day that ever he refused a composition too honourable for him, and
proposed by me on the behalf of a kinsman.”

There was something in all this that, as it were, overshot the mark.
Ravenswood could not disguise from himself that his noble kinsman
had more reasons for taking offence at the reception of his suit than
regarded his interest and honour, yet he could neither complain nor be
surprised that it should be so. He contented himself, therefore, with
repeating, that his attachment was to Miss Ashton personally; that he
desired neither wealth nor aggrandisement from her father’s means and
influence; and that nothing should prevent his keeping his engagement,
excepting her own express desire that it should be relinquished; and he
requested as a favour that the matter might be no more mentioned betwixt
them at present, assuring the Marquis of A----that he should be his
confidant or its interruption.

The Marquis soon had more agreeable, as well as more interesting,
subjects on which to converse. A foot-post, who had followed him from
Edinburgh to Ravenswood Castle, and had traced his steps to the
Tod’s Hole, brought him a packet laden with good news. The political
calculations of the Marquis had proved just, both in London and at
Edinburgh, and he saw almost within his grasp the pre-eminence for which
he had panted. The refreshments which the servants had prepared were now
put on the table, and an epicure would perhaps have enjoyed them with
additional zest from the contrast which such fare afforded to the
miserable cabin in which it was served up.

The turn of conversation corresponded with and added to the social
feelings of the company. The Marquis expanded with pleasure on the power
which probably incidents were likely to assign to him, and on the
use which eh hoped to make of it in serving his kinsman Ravenswood.
Ravenswood could but repeat the gratitude which he really felt, even
when he considered the topic as too long dwelt upon. The wine was
excellent, notwithstanding its having been brought in a runlet from
Edinburgh; and the habits of the Marquis, when engaged with such good
cheer, were somewhat sedentary. And so it fell out that they delayed
their journey two hours later than was their original purpose.

“But what of that, my good young friend?” said the Marquis. “Your Castle
of Wolf’s Crag is at but five or six miles’ distance, and will afford
the same hospitality to your kinsman of A----that it gave to this same
Sir William Ashton.”

“Sir William took the castle by storm,” said Ravenswood, “and, like many
a victor, had little reason to congratulate himself on his conquest.”
 “Well--well!” said Lord A----, whose dignity was something relaxed by
the wine he had drunk, “I see I must bribe you to harbour me. Come,
pledge me in a bumper health to the last young lady that slept at Wolf’s
Crag, and liked her quarters. My bones are not so tender as hers, and I
am resolved to occupy her apartment to-night, that I may judge how hard
the couch is that love can soften.”

“Your lordship may choose what penance you please,” said Ravenswood;
“but I assure you, I should expect my old servant to hang himself, or
throw himself from the battlements, should your lordship visit him so
unexpectedly. I do assure you, we are totally and literally unprovided.”

But his declaration only brought from his noble patron an assurance of
his own total indifference as to every species of accommodation, and his
determination to see the Tower of Wolf’s Crag. His ancestor, he
said, had been feasted there, when he went forward with the then Lord
Ravenswood to the fatal battle of Flodden, in which they both fell. Thus
hard pressed, the Master offered to ride forward to get matters put in
such preparation as time and circumstances admitted; but the Marquis
protested his kinsman must afford him his company, and would only
consent that an avant-courier should carry to the desinted seneschal,
Caleb Balderstone, the unexpected news of this invasion.

The Master of Ravenswood soon after accompanied the Marquis in his
carriage, as the latter had proposed; and when they became better
acquainted in the progress of the journey, his noble relation explained
the very liberal views which he entertained for his relation’s
preferment, in case of the success of his own political schemes. They
related to a secret and highly important commission beyond sea, which
could only be entrusted to a person of rank, talent, and perfect
confidence, and which, as it required great trust and reliance on the
envoy employed, could but not prove both honourable and advantageous to
him. We need not enter into the nature and purpose of this commission,
farther than to acquaint our readers that the charge was in prospect
highly acceptable to the Master of Ravenswood, who hailed with pleasure
the hope of emerging from his present state of indigence and inaction
into independence and honourable exertion.

While he listened thus eagerly to the details with which the Marquis
now thought it necessary to entrust him, the messenger who had been
despatched to the Tower of Wolf’s Crag returned with Caleb Balderstone’s
humble duty, and an assurance that “a’ should be in seemly order, sic as
the hurry of time permitted, to receive their lordships as it behoved.”

Ravenswood was too well accustomed to his seneschal’s mode of acting and
speaking to hope much from this confident assurance. He knew that Caleb
acted upon the principle of the Spanish generals, in the campaign
of ----, who, much to the perplexity of the Prince of Orange, their
commander-in-chief, used to report their troops as full in number,
and possessed of all necessary points of equipment, not considering it
consistent with their dignity, or the honour of Spain, to confess
any deficiency either in men or munition, until the want of both was
unavoidably discovered in the day of battle. Accordingly, Ravenswood
thought it necessary to give the Marquis some hint that the fair
assurance which they had just received from Caleb did not by any means
ensure them against a very indifferent reception.

“You do yourself injustice, Master,” said the Marquis, “or you wish
to surprise me agreeably. From this window I see a great light in the
direction where, if I remember aright, Wolf’s Crag lies; and, to judge
from the splendour which the old Tower sheds around it, the preparations
for our reception must be of no ordinary description. I remember your
father putting the same deception on me, when we went to the Tower for
a few days’ hawking, about twenty years since, and yet we spent our time
as jollily at Wolf’s Crag as we could have done at my own hunting seat
at B----.”

“Your lordship, I fear, will experience that the faculty of the
present proprietor to entertain his friends is greatly abridged,” said
Ravenswood; “the will, I need hardly say, remains the same. But I am as
much at a loss as your lordship to account for so strong and brilliant a
light as is now above Wolf’s Crag; the windows of the Tower are few and
narrow, and those of the lower story are hidden from us by the walls of
the court. I cannot conceive that any illumination of an ordinary nature
could afford such a blaze of light.”

The mystery was soon explained; for the cavalcade almost instantly
halted, and the voice of Caleb Balderstone was heard at the coach
window, exclaiming, in accents broken by grief and fear, “Och,
gentlemen! Och, my gude lords! Och, haud to the right! Wolf’s Crag is
burning, bower and ha’--a’ the rich plenishing outside and inside--a’
the fine graith, pictures, tapestries, needle-wark, hangings, and other
decorements--a’ in a bleeze, as if they were nae mair than sae mony
peats, or as muckle pease-strae! Haud to the right, gentlemen, I implore
ye; there is some sma’ provision making at Luckie Sma’trash’s; but oh,
wae for this night, and wae for me that lives to see it!”

Ravenswood was first stunned by this new and unexpected calamity; but
after a moment’s recollection he sprang from the carriage, and hastily
bidding his noble kinsman good-night, was about to ascend the hill
towards the castle, the broad and full conflagration of which now flung
forth a high column of red light, that flickered far to seaward upon the
dashing waves of the ocean.

“Take a horse, Master,” exclaimed the Marquis, greatly affected by this
additional misfortune, so unexpectedly heaped upon his young protege;
“and give me my ambling palfrey; and haste forward, you knaves, to see
what can be done to save the furniture, or to extinguish the fire--ride,
you knaves, for your lives!”

The attendants bustled together, and began to strike their horses with
the spur, and call upon Caleb to show them the road. But the voice
of that careful seneschal was heard above the tumult, “Oh, stop sirs,
stop--turn bridle, for the luve of Mercy; add not loss of lives to the
loss of warld’s gean! Thirty barrels of powther, landed out of a Dunkirk
dogger in the auld lord’s time--a’ in the vau’ts of the auld tower,--the
fire canna be far off it, I trow. Lord’s sake, to the right, lads--to
the right; let’s pit the hill atween us and peril,--a wap wi’ a
corner-stane o’ Wolf’s Crag wad defy the doctor!”

It will readily be supposed that this annunciation hurried the Marquis
and his attendants into the route which Caleb prescribed, dragging
Ravenswood along with them, although there was much in the matter which
he could not possibly comprehend. “Gunpowder!” he exclaimed, laying hold
of Caleb, who in vain endeavoured to escape from him; “what gunpowder?
How any quantity of powder could be in Wolf’s Crag without my knowledge,
I cannot possibly comprehend.”

“But I can,” interrupted the Marquis, whispering him, “I can comprehend
it thoroughly; for God’s sake, ask him no more questions at present.”

“There it is, now,” said Caleb, extricating himself from his master, and
adjusting his dress, “your honour will believe his lordship’s honourable
testimony. His lordship minds weel how, in the year that him they ca’d
King Willie died----”

“Hush! hush, my good friend!” said the Marquis; “I shall satisfy your
master upon that subject.”

“And the people at Wolf’s Hope,” said Ravenswood, “did none of them come
to your assistance before the flame got so high?”

“Ay did they, mony ane of them, the rapscallions!” said Caleb; “but
truly I was in nae hurry to let them into the Tower, where there were so
much plate and valuables.”

“Confound you for an impudent liar!” said Ravenswood, in uncontrollable
ire, “there was not a single ounce of----”

“Forbye,” said the butler, most irreverently raising his voice to a
pitch which drowned his master’s, “the fire made fast on us, owing to
the store of tapestry and carved timmer in the banqueting-ha’, and the
loons ran like scaulded rats sae sune as they heard of the gunpouther.”

“I do entreat,” said the Marquis to Ravenswood, “you will ask him no
more questions.”

“Only one, my lord. What has become of poor Mysie?”

“Mysie!” said Caleb, “I had nae time to look about ony Mysie; she’s
in the Tower, I’se warrant, biding her awful doom.” “By heaven,” said
Ravenswood, “I do not understand all this! The life of a faithful old
creature is at stake; my lord, I will be withheld no longer; I will at
least ride up, and see whether the danger is as imminent as this old
fool pretends.”

“Weel, then, as I live by bread,” said Caleb, “Mysie is weel and safe.
I saw her out of the castle before I left it mysell. Was I ganging to
forget an auld fellow-servant?”

“What made you tell me the contrary this moment?” said his master.

“Did I tell you the contrary?” said Caleb; “then I maun hae been
dreaming surely, or this awsome night has turned my judgment; but safe
she is, and ne’er a living soul in the castle, a’ the better for them:
they wau have gotten an unco heezy.”

The Master of Ravenswood, upon this assurance being solemnly reiterated,
and notwithstanding his extreme wish to witness the last explosion,
which was to ruin to the ground the mansion of his fathers, suffered
himself to be dragged onward towards the village of Wolf’s Hope, where
not only the change-house, but that of our well-known friend the cooper,
were all prepared for reception of himself and his noble guest, with a
liberality of provision which requires some explanation.

We omitted to mention in its place, that Lockhard having fished out the
truth concerning the mode by which Caleb had obtained the supplies for
his banquet, the Lord Keeper, amused with the incident, and desirous at
the time to gratify Ravenswood, had recommended the cooper of Wolf’s
Hope to the official situation under government the prospect of which
had reconciled him to the loss of his wild-fowl. Mr. Girder’s preferment
had occasioned a pleasing surprise to old Caleb; for when, some days
after his master’s departure, he found himself absolutely compelled, by
some necessary business, to visit the fishing hamlet, and was gliding
like a ghost past the door of the cooper, for fear of being summoned to
give some account of the progress of the solicitation in his favour, or,
more probably that the inmates might upbraid him with the false hope
he had held out upon the subject, he heard himself, not without some
apprehension, summoned at once in treble, tenor, and bass--a trio
performed by the voices of Mrs. Girder, old Dame Loup-the-Dyke, and the
goodman of the dwelling--“Mr. Caleb!--Mr. Caleb Balderstone! I hope
ye arena ganging dry-lipped by our door, and we sae muckle indebted to
you?”

This might be said ironically as well as in earnest. Caleb augured the
worst, turned a deaf ear to the trio aforesaid, and was moving doggedly
on, his ancient castor pulled over his brows, and his eyes bent on the
ground, as if to count the flinty pebbles with which the rude pathway
was causewayed. But on a sudden he found himself surrounded in his
progress, like a stately merchantman in the Gut of Gibraltar (I hope
the ladies will excuse the tarpaulin phrase) by three Algerine galleys.
“Gude guide us, Mr. Balderstone!” said Mrs. Girder. “Wha wad hae thought
it of an auld and kenn’d friend!” said the mother.

“And no sae muckle as stay to receive our thanks,” said the cooper
himself, “and frae the like o’ me that seldom offers them! I am sure I
hope there’s nae ill seed sawn between us, Mr. Balderstone. Ony man that
has said to ye I am no gratefu’ for the situation of Queen’s cooper, let
me hae a whample at him wi’ mine eatche, that’s a’.”

“My good friends--my dear friends,” said Caleb, still doubting how the
certainty of the matter might stand, “what needs a’ this ceremony? Ane
tries to serve their friends, and sometimes they may happen to prosper,
and sometimes to misgie. Naething I care to be fashed wi’ less than
thanks; I never could bide them.”

“Faith, Mr. Balderstone, ye suld hae been fashed wi’ few o’ mine,” said
the downright man of staves and hoops, “if I had only your gude-will to
thank ye for: I suld e’en hae set the guse, and the wild deukes, adn the
runlet of sack to balance that account. Gude-will, man, is a geizen’d
tub, that hauds in nae liquor; but gude deed’s like the cask, tight,
round, and sound, that will haud liquor for the king.”

“Have ye no heard of our letter,” said the mother-in-law, “making our
John [Gibbie] the Queen’s cooper for certain? and scarce a chield that
had ever hammered gird upon tub but was applying for it?”

“Have I heard!!!” said Caleb, who now found how the wind set, with an
accent of exceeding contempt, at the doubt expressed--“have I heard,
quo’she!!!” and as he spoke he changed his shambling, skulking, dodging
pace into a manly and authoritative step, readjusted his cocked hat,
and suffered his brow to emerge from under it in all the pride of
aristocracy, like the sun from behind a cloud.

“To be sure, he canna but hae heard,” said the good woman.

“Ay, to be sure it’s impossible but I should,” said Caleb; “and sae I’ll
be the first to kiss ye, joe, and wish you, cooper, much joy of your
preferment, naething doubting but ye ken wha are your friends, and HAVE
helped ye, and CAN help ye. I thought it right to look a wee strange
upon it at first,” added Caleb, “just to see if ye were made of the
right mettle; but ye ring true, lad--ye ring true!”

So saying, with a most lordly air he kissed the women, and abandoned
his hand, with an air of serene patronage, to the hearty shake of
Mr. Girder’s horn-hard palm. Upon this complete, and to Caleb most
satisfactory, information he did not, it may readily be believed,
hesitate to accept an invitation to a solemn feast, to which were
invited, not only all the NOTABLES of the village, but even his ancient
antagonist, Mr. Dingwall, himself. At this festivity he was, of course,
the most welcome and most honoured guest; and so well did he ply the
company with stories of what he could do with his master, his master
with the Lord Keeper, the Lord Keeper with the council, and the council
with the king [queen], that before the company dismissed (which was,
indeed, rather at an early hour than a late one), every man of note in
the village was ascending to the top-gallant of some ideal preferment by
the ladder of ropes which Caleb had presented to their imagination. Nay,
the cunning butler regained in that moment not only all the influence he
possessed formerly over the villagers, when the baronial family which
he served were at the proudest, but acquired even an accession of
importance. The writer--the very attorney himself, such is the thirst of
preferment--felt the force of the attraction, and taking an opportunity
to draw Caleb into a corner, spoke, with affectionate regret, of the
declining health of the sheriff-clerk of the county.

“An excellent man--a most valuable man, Mr. Caleb; but fat sall I say!
we are peer feckless bodies, here the day and awa’ by cock-screech the
morn; and if he failyies, there maun be somebody in his place; and gif
that ye could airt it my way, I sall be thankful, man--a gluve stuffed
wi gowd nobles; an’ hark ye, man something canny till yoursell, and the
Wolf’s Hope carles to settle kindly wi’ the Master of Ravenswood--that
is, Lord Ravenswood--God bless his lordship!”

A smile, and a hearty squeeze by the hand, was the suitable answer to
this overture; and Caleb made his escape from the jovial party, in order
to avoid committing himself by any special promises.

“The Lord be gude to me,” said Caleb, when he found himself in the open
air, and at liberty to give vent to the self-exultation with which
he was, as it were, distended; “did ever ony man see sic a set of
green-gaislings? The very pickmaws and solan-geese out-bye yonder at
the Bass hae ten times their sense! God, an I had been the Lord High
Commissioner to the Estates o’ Parliament, they couldna hae beflumm’d
me mair; and, to speak Heaven’s truth, I could hardly hae beflumm’d them
better neither! But the writer--ha! ha! ha!--ah, ha! ha! ha! mercy on
me, that I suld live in my auld days to gie the ganag-bye to the very
writer! Sheriff-clerk!!! But I hae an auld account to settle wi’ the
carle; and to make amends for bye-ganes, the office shall just cost him
as much time-serving and tide-serving as if he were to get it in gude
earnest, of whilk there is sma’ appearance, unless the Master learns
mair the ways of this warld, whilk it is muckle to be doubted that he
never will do.”




CHAPTER XXVI.

     Why flames yon far summit--why shoot to the blast
     Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?
     ‘Tis the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven
     From thine eyrie, that beacons the darkness of Heaven.

     CAMPBELL.

THE circumstances announced in the conclusion of the last chapter will
account for the ready and cheerful reception of the Marquis of A---- and
the Master of Ravenswood in the village of Wolf’s Hope. In fact, Caleb
had no sooner announced the conflagration of the tower than the whole
hamlet were upon foot to hasten to extinguish the flames. And although
that zealous adherent diverted their zeal by intimating the formidable
contents of the subterranean apartments, yet the check only turned their
assiduity into another direction. Never had there been such slaughtering
of capons, and fat geese, and barndoor fowls; never such boiling of
“reested” hams; never such making of car-cakes and sweet scones, Selkirk
bannocks, cookies, and petticoat-tails--delicacies little known to the
present generation. Never had there been such a tapping of barrels, and
such uncorking of greybeards, in the village of Wolf’s Hope. All the
inferior houses were thrown open for the reception of the Marquis’s
dependants, who came, it was thought, as precursors of the shower of
preferment which hereafter was to leave the rest of Scotland dry,
in order to distil its rich dews on the village of Wolf’s Hope under
Lammermoor. The minister put in his claim to have the guests of
distinction lodged at the manse, having his eye, it was thought, upon
a neighbouring preferment, where the incumbent was sickly; but Mr.
Balderstone destined that honour to the cooper, his wife, and wife’s
mother, who danced for joy at the preferences thus assigned them.

Many a beck and many a bow welcomed these noble guests to as good
entertainment as persons of such rank could set before such visitors;
and the old dame, who had formerly lived in Ravenswood Castle, and
knew, as she said, the ways of the nobility, was in no whit wanting in
arranging matters, as well as circumstances permitted, according to the
etiquette of the times. The cooper’s house was so roomy that each guest
had his separate retiring-room, to which they were ushered with all due
ceremony, while the plentiful supper was in the act of being placed upon
the table.

Ravenswood no sooner found himself alone than, impelled by a thousand
feelings, he left the apartment, the house, and the village, and hastily
retraced his steps to the brow of the hill, which rose betwixt the
village and screened it from the tower, in order to view the final fall
of the house of his fathers. Some idle boys from the hamlet had taken
the same direction out of curiosity, having first witnessed the arrival
of the coach and six and its attendants. As they ran one by one past the
Master, calling to each other to “Come and see the auld tower blaw up in
the lift like the peelings of an ingan,” he could not but feel himself
moved with indignation. “And these are the sons of my father’s vassals,”
 he said--“of men bound, both by law and gratitude, to follow our steps
through battle, and fire, and flood; and now the destruction of their
liege lord’s house is but a holiday’s sight to them.”

These exasperating reflections were partly expresssed in the acrimony
with which he exclaimed, on feeling himself pulled by the cloak: “What
do you want, you dog?”

“I am a dog, and an auld dog too,” answered Caleb, for it was he who had
taken the freedom, “and I am like to get a dog’s wages; but it does not
signification a pinch of sneesing, for I am ower auld a dog to learn new
tricks, or to follow a new master.”

As he spoke, Ravenswood attained the ridge of the hill from which Wolf’s
Crag was visible; the flames had entirely sunk down, and, to his great
surprise, there was only a dusky reddening upon the clouds immediately
over the castle, which seemed the reflection of the embers of the sunken
fire.

“The place cannot have blown up,” said the Master; “we must have heard
the report: if a quarter of the gunpowder was there you tell me of, it
would have been heard twenty miles off.”

“It’ve very like it wad,” said Balderstone, composedly.

“Then the fire cannot have reached the vaults?”

“It’s like no,” answered Caleb, with the same impenetrable gravity.

“Hark ye, Caleb,” said his master, “this grows a little too much for
my patience. I must go and examine how matters stand at Wolf’s Crag
myself.”

“Your honour is ganging to gang nae sic gate,” said Caleb, firmly.

“And why not?” said Ravenswood, sharply; “who or what shall prevent me?”

“Even I mysell,” said Caleb, with the same determination.

“You, Balderstone!” replied the Master; “you are forgetting yourself, I
think.”

“But I think no,” said Balderstone; “for I can just tell ye a’ about the
castle on this knowe-head as weel as if ye were at it. Only dinna pit
yoursell into a kippage, and expose yoursell before the weans, or before
the Marquis, when ye gang down-bye.”

“Speak out, you old fool,” replied his master, “and let me know the best
and the worst at once.”

“Ou, the best and the warst is, just that the tower is standing hail and
feir, as safe and as empty as when ye left it.”

“Indeed! and the fire?” said Ravenswood. “Not a gleed of fire, then,
except the bit kindling peat, and maybe a spunk in Mysie’s cutty-pipe,”
 replied Caleb.

“But the flame?” demanded Ravenswood--“the broad blaze which might have
been seen ten miles off--what occasioned that?”

“Hout awa’! it’s an auld saying and a true--

     Little’s the light Will be seen far in a mirk night.

A wheen fern and horse little that I fired in the courtyard, after
sending back the loon of a footman; and, to speak Heaven’s truth, the
next time that ye send or bring ony body here, let them ge gentles
allenarly, without ony fremd servants, like that chield Lockhard, to
be gledging and gleeing about, and looking upon the wrang side of ane’s
housekeeping, to the discredit of the family, and forcing ane to damn
their souls wi’ telling ae lee after another faster than I can count
them: I wad rather set fire to the tower in gude earnest, and burn it
ower my ain head into the bargain, or I see the family dishonoured in
the sort.”

“Upon my word, I am infinitely obliged by the proposal, Caleb,” said his
master, scarce able to restrain his laughter, though rather angry at
the same time. “But the gunpowder--is there such a thing in the tower?
The Marquis seemed to know of it.” “The pouther, ha! ha! ha!--the
Marquis, ha! ha! ha!” replied Caleb,--“if your honour were to brain me,
I behooved to laugh,--the Marquis--the pouther! Was it there? Ay, it was
there. Did he ken o’t? My certie! the Marquis kenn’d o’t, and it was the
best o’ the game; for, when I couldna pacify your honour wi’ a’ that I
could say, I aye threw out a word mair about the gunpouther, and garr’d
the Marquis tak the job in his ain hand.”

“But you have not answered my question,” said the Master, impatiently;
“how came the powder there, and where is it now?”

“Ou, it came there, an ye maun needs ken,” said Caleb, looking
mysteriously, and whispering, “when there was like to be a wee bit
rising here; and the Marquis, and a’ the great lords of the north, were
a’ in it, and mony a gudely gun and broadsword were ferried ower frae
Dunkirk forbye the pouther. Awfu’ work we had getting them into the
tower under cloud o’ night, for ye maun think it wasna everybody could
be trusted wi’ sic kittle jobs. But if ye will gae hame to your supper,
I will tell you a’ about it as ye gang down.”

“And these wretched boys,” said Ravenswood, “is it your pleasure they
are to sit there all night, to wait for the blowing up of a tower that
is not even on fire?”

“Surely not, if it is your honour’s pleasure that they suld gang hame;
although,” added Caleb, “it wadna do them a grain’s damage: they wad
screigh less the next day, and sleep the sounder at e’en. But just as
your honour likes.”

Stepping accordingly towards the urchins who manned the knolls near
which they stood, Caleb informed them, in an authoritative tone, that
their honours Lord Ravenswood and the Marquis of A---- had given orders
that the tower was not to be blow up till next day at noon. The boys
dispersed upon this comfortable assurance. One or two, however, followed
Caleb for more information, particularly the urchin whom he had cheated
while officiating as turnspit, who screamed, “Mr. Balderstone!--Mr.
Balderstone! then the castle’s gane out like an auld wife’s spunk?”

“To be sure it is, callant,” said the butler; “do ye think the castle
of as great a lord as Lord Ravenswood wad continue in a bleeze, and him
standing looking on wi’ his ain very een? It’s aye right,” continued
Caleb, shaking off his ragged page, and closing in to his Master, “to
train up weans, as the wise man says, in the way they should go, and,
aboon a’, to teach them respect to their superiors.”

“But all this while, Caleb, you have never told me what became of the
arms and powder,” said Ravenswood.

“Why, as for the arms,” said Caleb, “it was just like the bairn’s
rhyme--

     Some gaed east and some gaed west,
     And some gaed to the craw’s nest.

And for the pouther, I e’en changed it, as occasion served, with the
skippers o’ Dutch luggers and French vessels, for gin and brandy, and is
served the house mony a year--a gude swap too, between what cheereth the
soul of man and that which hingeth it clean out of his body; forbye,
I keepit a wheen pounds of it for yoursell when ye wanted to take the
pleasure o’ shooting: whiles, in these latter days, I wad hardly hae
kenn’d else whar to get pouther for your pleasure. And now that your
anger is ower, sir, wasna that weel managed o’ me, and arena ye far
better sorted doun yonder than ye could hae been in your ain auld ruins
up-bye yonder, as the case stands wi’ us now? the mair’s the pity!”

“I believe you may be right, Caleb; but, before burning down my castle,
either in jest or in earnest,” said Ravenswood, “I think I had a right
to be in the secret.”

“Fie for shame, your honour!” replied Caleb; “it fits an auld carle like
me weel eneugh to tell lees for the credit of the family, but it wadna
beseem the like o’ your honour’s sell; besides, young folk are no
judicious: they cannot make the maist of a bit figment. Now this
fire--for a fire it sall be, if I suld burn the auld stable to make it
mair feasible--this fire, besides that it will be an excuse for asking
ony thing we want through the country, or doun at the haven--this
fire will settle mony things on an honourable footing for the family’s
credit, that cost me telling twenty daily lees to a wheen idle chaps
and queans, and, what’s waur, without gaining credence.” “That was hard
indeed, Caleb; but I do not see how this fire should help your veracity
or your credit.”

“There it is now?” said Caleb; “wasna I saying that young folk had a
green judgment? How suld it help me, quotha? It will be a creditable
apology for the honour of the family for this score of years to come, if
it is weel guided. ‘Where’s the family pictures?’ says ae meddling body.
‘The great fire at Wolf’s Crag,’ answers I. ‘Where’s the family plate?’
says another. ‘The great fire,’ says I; ‘wha was to think of plate,
when life and limb were in danger?’ ‘Where’s the wardrobe and the
linens?--where’s the tapestries and the decorements?--beds of state,
twilts, pands and testors, napery and broidered wark?’ ‘The fire--the
fire--the fire.’ Guide the fire weel, and it will serve ye for a’ that
ye suld have and have not; and, in some sort, a gude excuse is better
than the things themselves; for they maun crack and wear out, and be
consumed by time, whereas a gude offcome, prudently and creditably
handled, may serve a nobleman and his family, Lord kens how lang!”

Ravenswood was too well acquainted with his butler’s pertinacity and
self-opinion to dispute the point with him any farther. Leaving Caleb,
therefore, to the enjoyment of his own successful ingenuity, he returned
to the hamlet, where he found the Marquis and the good women of the
mansion under some anxiety--the former on account of his absence, the
others for the discredit their cookery might sustain by the delay of the
supper. All were now at ease, and heard with pleasure that the fire at
the castle had burned out of itself without reaching the vaults, which
was the only information that Ravenswood thought it proper to give in
public concerning the event of his butler’s strategem.

They sat down to an excellent supper. No invitation could prevail on
Mr. and Mrs. Girder, even in their own house, to sit down at table with
guests of such high quality. They remained standing in the apartment,
and acted the part of respectful and careful attendants on the company.
Such were the manners of the time. The elder dame, confident through
her age and connexion with the Ravenswood family, was less scrupulously
ceremonious. She played a mixed part betwixt that of the hostess of an
inn and the mistress of a private house, who receives guests above her
own degree. She recommended, and even pressed, what she thought best,
and was herself easily entreated to take a moderate share of the good
cheer, in order to encourage her guests by her own example. Often she
interrupted herself, to express her regret that “my lord did not eat;
that the Master was pyking a bare bane; that, to be sure, there was
naething there fit to set before their honours; that Lord Allan, rest
his saul, used to like a pouthered guse, and said it was Latin for a
tass o’ brandy; that the brandy came frae France direct; for, for a’ the
English laws and gaugers, the Wolf’s Hope brigs hadna forgotten the gate
to Dunkirk.”

Here the cooper admonished his mother-in-law with his elbow, which
procured him the following special notice in the progress of her speech:

“Ye needna be dunshin that gate, John [Gibbie],” continued the old lady;
“naebody says that YE ken whar the brandy comes frae; and it wadna be
fitting ye should, and you the Queen’s cooper; and what signifies’t,”
 continued she, addressing Lord Ravenswood, “to king, queen, or kaiser
whar an auld wife like me buys her pickle sneeshin, or her drap
brandy-wine, to haud her heart up?”

Having thus extricated herself from her supposed false step, Dame
Loup-the-Dyke proceeded, during the rest of the evening, to supply, with
great animation, and very little assistance from her guests, the funds
necessary for the support of the conversation, until, declining any
further circulation of their glass, her guests requested her permission
to retire to their apartments.

The Marquis occupied the chamber of dais, which, in every house above
the rank of a mere cottage, was kept sacred for such high occasions as
the present. The modern finishing with plaster was then unknown, and
tapestry was confined to the houses of the nobility and superior gentry.
The cooper, therefore, who was a man of some vanity, as well as some
wealth, had imitated the fashion observed by the inferior landholders
and clergy, who usually ornamented their state apartments with hangings
of a sort of stamped leather, manufactured in the Netherlands, garnished
with trees and animals executed in copper foil, and with many a pithy
sentence of morality, which, although couched in Low Dutch, were perhaps
as much attended to in practice as if written in broad Scotch. The
whole had somewhat of a gloomy aspect; but the fire, composed of
old pitch-barrel staves, blazed merrily up the chimney; the bed was
decorated with linen of most fresh and dazzling whiteness, which had
never before been used, and might, perhaps, have never been used at
all, but for this high occasion. On the toilette beside, stood an
old-fashioned mirror, in a fillagree frame, part of the dispersed finery
of the neighbouring castle. It was flanked by a long-necked bottle of
Florence wine, by which stood a glass nearly as tall, resembling
in shape that which Teniers usually places in the hands of his own
portrait, when he paints himself as mingling in the revels of a country
village. To counterbalance those foreign sentinels, there mounted guard
on the other side of the mirror two stout warders of Scottish lineage;
a jug, namely, of double ale, which held a Scotch pint, and a quaigh,
or bicker, of ivory and ebony, hooped with silver, the work of
John Girder’s own hands, and the pride of his heart. Besides these
preparations against thirst, there was a goodly diet-loaf, or sweet
cake; so that, with such auxiliaries, the apartment seemed victualled
against a siege of two or three days.

It only remains to say, that the Marquis’s valet was in attendance,
displaying his master’s brocaded nightgown, and richly embroidered
velvet cap, lined and faced with Brussels lace, upon a huge leathern
easy-chair, wheeled round so as to have the full advantage of the
comfortable fire which we have already mentioned. We therefore commit
that eminent person to his night’s repose, trusting he profited by the
ample preparations made for his accommodation--preparations which we
have mentioned in detail, as illustrative of ancient Scottish manners.

It is not necessary we should be equally minute in describing the
sleeping apartment of the Master of Ravenswood, which was that usually
occupied by the goodman and goodwife themselves. It was comfortably
hung with a sort of warm-coloured worsted, manufactured in Scotland,
approaching in trexture to what is now called shalloon. A staring
picture of John [Gibbie] Girder himself ornamented this dormiory,
painted by a starving Frenchman, who had, God knows how or why, strolled
over from Flushing or Dunkirk to Wolf’s Hope in a smuggling dogger. The
features were, indeed, those of the stubborn, opinionative, yet sensible
artisan, but Monsieur had contrived to throw a French grace into the
look and manner, so utterly inconsistent with the dogged gravity of the
original, that it was impossible to look at it without laughing. John
and his family, however, piqued themselves not a little upon this
picture, and were proportionably censured by the neighbourhood, who
pronounced that the cooper, in sitting for the same, and yet more in
presuming to hang it up in his bedchamber, had exceeded his privilege as
the richest man of the village; at once stept beyond the bounds of his
own rank, and encroached upon those of the superior orders; and,
in fine, had been guilty of a very overweening act of vanity and
presumption. Respect for the memory of my deceased friend, Mr. Richard
Tinto, has obliged me to treat this matter at some length; but I spare
the reader his prolix though curious observations, as well upon the
character of the French school as upon the state of painting in Scotland
at the beginning of the 18th century.

The other preparations of the Master’s sleeping apartment were similar
to those in the chamber of dais.

At the usual early hour of that period, the Marquis of A---- and his
kinsman prepared to resume their journey. This could not be done
without an ample breakfast, in which cold meat and hot meat, and oatmeal
flummery, wine and spirits, and milk varied by every possible mode of
preparation, evinced the same desire to do honour to their guests which
had been shown by the hospitable owners of the mansion upon the evening
before. All the bustle of preparation for departure now resounded
through Wolf’s Hope. There was paying of bills and shaking of hands,
and saddling of horses, and harnessing of carriages, and distributing
of drink-money. The Marquis left a broad piece for the gratification
of John Girder’s household, which he, the said John, was for some time
disposed to convert to his own use; Dingwall, the writer, assuring
him he was justified in so doing, seeing he was the disburser of
those expenses which were the occasion of the gratification. But,
notwithstanding this legal authority, John could not find in his heart
to dim the splendour of his late hospitality by picketing anything in
the nature of a gratuity. He only assured his menials he would consider
them as a damned ungrateful pack if they bought a gill of brandy
elsewhere than out of his own stores; and as the drink-money was likely
to go to its legitimate use, he comforted himself that, in this manner,
the Marquis’s donative would, without any impeachment of credit and
character, come ultimately into his own exclusive possession.

While arrangements were making for departure, Ravenswood made blythe the
heart of his ancient butler by informing him, cautiously however (for
he knew Caleb’s warmth of imagination), of the probable change which was
about to take place in his fortunes. He deposited with Balderstone, at
the same time, the greater part of his slender funds, with an assurance,
which he was obliged to reiterate more than once, that he himself had
sufficient supplies in certain prospect. He therefore enjoined Caleb, as
he valued his favour, to desist from all farther maneouvres against the
inhabitants of Wolf’s Hope, their cellars, poultry-yards, and substance
whatsoever. In this prohibition, the old domestic acquiesced more
readily than his master expected.

“It was doubtless,” he said, “a shame, a discredit, and a sin to harry
the puir creatures, when the family were in circumstances to live
honourably on their ain means; and there might be wisdom,” he added, “in
giving them a while’s breathing-time at any rate, that they might be the
more readily brought forward upon his honour’s future occasions.”

This matter being settled, and having taken an affectionate farewell of
his old domestic, the Master rejoined his noble relative, who was now
ready to enter his carriage. The two landladies, old and young, having
received in all kindly greeting a kiss from each of their noble guests,
stood simpering at the door of their house, as the coach and six,
followed by its train of clattering horsemen, thundered out of the
village. John Girder also stood upon his threshold, now looking at his
honoured right hand, which had been so lately shaken by a marquis and
a lord, and now giving a glance into the interior of his mansion, which
manifested all the disarray of the late revel, as if balancing
the distinction which he had attained with the expenses of the
entertainment.

At length he opened his oracular jaws. “Let every man and woman here set
about their ain business, as if there was nae sic thing as marquis or
master, duke or drake, laird or lord, in this world. Let the house be
redd up, the broken meat set bye, and if there is ony thing totally
uneatable, let it be gien to the puir folk; and, gude mother and wife, I
hae just ae thing to entreat ye, that ye will never speak to me a single
word, good or bad, anent a’ this nonsense wark, but keep a’ your cracks
about it to yoursells and your kimmers, for my head is weel-nigh dung
donnart wi’ it already.”

As John’s authority was tolerably absolute, all departed to their usual
occupations, leaving him to build castles in the air, if he had a mind,
upon the court favour which he had acquired by the expenditure of his
worldly substance.




CHAPTER XXVII.

     Why, now I have Dame Fortune by the Forelock,
     And if she escapes my grasp, the fault is mine;
     He that hath buffeted with stern adversity
     Best knows the shape his course to favouring breezes.

     Old Play.

OUR travellers reach Edinburgh without any farther adventure, and the
Master of Ravenswood, as had been previously settled, took up his abode
with his noble friend.

In the mean time, the political crisis which had been expected took
place, and the Tory party obtained in the Scottish, as in the English,
councils of Queen Anne a short-lived ascendency, of which it is not our
business to trace either the cause or consequences. Suffice it to say,
that it affected the different political parties according to the nature
of their principles. In England, many of the High Church party, with
Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, at their head, affected to separate
their principles from those of the Jacobites, and, on that account,
obtained the denomination of Whimsicals. The Scottish High Church party,
on the contrary, or, as they termed themselves, the Cavaliers, were more
consistent, if not so prudent, in their politics, and viewed all the
changes now made as preparatory to calling to the throne, upon the
queen’s demise, her brother the Chevalier de St. George. Those who had
suffered in his service now entertained the most unreasonable hopes,
not only of indemnification, but of vengeance upon their political
adversaries; while families attached to the Whig interest saw nothing
before them but a renewal of the hardships they had undergone during the
reigns of Charles the Second and his brother, and a retaliation of the
confiscation which had been inflicted upon the Jacobites during that of
King William.

But the most alarmed at the change of system was that prudential set of
persons, some of whom are found in all governments, but who abound in a
provincial administration like that of Scotland during the period,
and who are what Cromwell called waiters upon Providence, or, in other
words, uniform adherents to the party who are uppermost. Many of these
hastened to read their recantation to the Marquis of A----; and, as
it was easily seen that he took a deep interest in the affairs of
his kinsman, the Master of Ravenswood, they were the first to suggest
measures for retrieving at least a part of his property, and for
restoring him in blood against his father’s attainder.

Old Lord Turntippet professed to be one of the most anxious for the
success of these measures; for “it grieved him to the very saul,” he
said, “to see so brave a young gentleman, of sic auld and undoubted
nobility, and, what was mair than a’ that, a bluid relation of the
Marquis of A----, the man whom,” he swore, “he honoured most upon
the face of the earth, brougth to so severe a pass. For his ain
puir peculiar,” as he said, “and to contribute something to the
rehabilitation of sae auld ane house,” the said Turntippet sent in three
family pictures lacking the frames, and six high-backed chairs, with
worked Turkey cushions, having the crest of Ravenswood broidered
thereon, without charging a penny either of the principal or interest
they had cost him, when he bought them, sixteen years before, at a roup
of the furniture of Lord Ravenswood’s lodgings in the Canongate.

Much more to Lord Turntippet’s dismay than to his surprise, although
he affected to feel more of the latter than the former, the Marquis
received his gift very drily, and observed, that his lordship’s
restitution, if he expected it to be received by the Master of
Ravenswood and his friends, must comprehend a pretty large farm, which,
having been mortgaged to Turntippet for a very inadequate sum, he had
contrived, during the confusion of the family affairs, and by means
well understood by the lawyers of that period, to acquire to himself in
absolute property.

The old time-serving lord winced excessively under the requisition,
protesting to God, that he saw no occasion the lad could have for the
instant possession of the land, seeing he would doubtless now recover
the bulk of his estate from Sir William Ashton, to which he was ready to
contribute by every means in his power, as was just and reasonable; and
finally declaring, that he was willing to settle the land on the young
gentleman after his own natural demise.

But all these excuses availed nothing, and he was compelled to disgorge
the property, on receiving back the sum for which it had been mortgaged.
Having no other means of making peace with the higher powers, he
returned home sorrowful and malcontent, complaining to his confidants,
“That every mutation or change in the state had hitherto been productive
of some sma’ advantage to him in his ain quiet affairs; but that the
present had--pize upon it!--cost him one of the best penfeathers o’ his
wing.”

Similar measures were threatened against others who had profited by
the wreck of the fortune of Ravenswood; and Sir William Ashton, in
particular, was menaced with an appeal to the House of Peers, a court
of equity, against the judicial sentences, proceeding upon a strict and
severe construction of the letter of the law, under which he held the
castle and barony of Ravenswood. With him, however, the Master, as well
for Lucy’s sake as on account of the hospitality he had received from
him, felt himself under the necessity of proceeding with great candor.
He wrote to the late Lord Keeper, for he no longer held that office,
stating frankly the engagement which existed between him and Miss
Ashton, requesting his permission for their union, and assuring him of
his willingness to put the settlement of all matters between them upon
such a footing as Sir William himself should think favourable.

The same messenger was charged with a letter to Lady Ashton, deprecating
any cause of displeasure which the Master might unintentionally have
given her, enlarging upon his attachment to Miss Ashton, and the length
to which it had proceeded, and conjuring the lady, as a Douglas in
nature as well as in name, generously to forget ancient prejudices and
misunderstandings, and to believe that the family had acquired a friend,
and she herself a respectful and attached humble servant, in him who
subscribed himself, “Edgar, Master of Ravenswood.” A third letter
Ravenswood addressed to Lucy, and the messenger was instructed to find
some secret and secure means of delivering it into her own hands. It
contained the strongest protestations of continued affection, and
dwelt upon the approaching change of the writer’s fortunes, as chiefly
valuable by tending to remove the impediments to their union. He related
the steps he had taken to overcome the prejudices of her parents,
and especially of her mother, and expressed his hope they might prove
effectual. If not, he still trusted that his absence from Scotland upon
an important and honourable mission might give time for prejudices to
die away; while he hoped and trusted Miss Ashton’s constancy, on which
he had the most implicit reliance, would baffle any effort that might
be used to divert her attachment. Much more there was, which, however
interesting to the lovers themselves, would afford the reader neither
interest nor information. To each of these three letters the Master of
Ravenswood received an answer, but by different means of conveyance, and
certainly couched in very different styles.

Lady Ashton answered his letter by his own messenger, who was not
allowed to remain at Ravenswood a moment longer than she was engaged
in penning these lines.

“For the hand of Mr. Ravenswood of Wolf’s Crag--These:

“SIR, UNKNOWN:

“I have received a letter, signed ‘Edgar, Master of Ravenswood,’
concerning the writer whereof I am uncertain, seeing that the honours of
such a family were forfeited for high treason in the person of Allan,
late Lord Ravenswood. Sir, if you shall happen to be the person so
subscribing yourself, you will please to know, that I claim the full
interest of a parent in Miss Lucy Ashton, which I have disposed of
irrevocably in behalf of a worthy person. And, sir, were this otherwise,
I would not listen to a proposal from you, or any of your house, seeing
their hand has been uniformly held up against the freedom of the subject
and the immunities of God’s kirk. Sir, it is not a flightering blink of
prosperity which can change my constant opinion in this regard, seeing
it has been my lot before now, like holy David, to see the wicked great
in power and flourishing like a green bay-tree; nevertheless I passed,
and they were not, and the place thereof knew them no more. Wishing you
to lay these things to your heart for your own sake, so far as they may
concern you, I pray you to take no farther notice of her who desires to
remain your unknown servant,

“MARGARET DOUGLAS,

“otherwise ASHTON.”


About two days after he had received this very unsatisfactory epistle,
the Master of Ravenswood, while walking up the High Street of Edinburgh,
was jostled by a person, in whom, as the man pulled off his hat to make
an apology, he recognized Lockhard, the confidential domestic of
Sir William Ashton. The man bowed, slipt a letter into his hand, and
disappeared. The packet contained four close-written folios, from which,
however, as is sometimes incident to the compositions of great lawyers,
little could be extracted, excepting that the writer felt himself in a
very puzzling predicament.

Sir William spoke at length of his high value and regard for his dear
young friend, the Master of Ravenswood, and of his very extreme high
value and regard for the Marquis of A----, his very dear old friend;
he trusted that any measures that they might adopt, in which he was
concerned, would be carred on with due regard to the sanctity of
decreets and judgments obtained in foro contentioso; protesting, before
men and angels, that if the law of Scotland, as declared in her supreme
courts, were to undergo a reversal in the English House of Lords, the
evils which would thence arise to the public would inflict a greater
wound upon his heart than any loss he might himself sustain by such
irregular proceedings. He flourished much on generosity and forgiveness
of mutual injuries, and hinted at the mutability of human affairs,
always favourite topics with the weaker party in politics. He
pathetically lamented, and gently censured, the haste which had been
used in depriving him of his situation of Lord Keeper, which his
experience had enabled him to fill with some advantage to the public,
without so much as giving him an opportunity of explaining how far his
own views of general politics might essentially differ from those now in
power. He was convinced the Marquis of A---- had as sincere intentions
towards the public as himself or any man; and if, upon a conference,
they could have agreed upon the measures by which it was to be pursued,
his experience and his interest should have gone to support the present
administration. Upon the engagement betwixt Ravenswood and his daughter,
he spoke in a dry and confused manner. He regretted so premature a
step as the engagement of the young people should have been taken, and
conjured the Master to remember he had never given any encouragement
thereunto; and observed that, as a transaction inter minores, and
without concurrence of his daughter’s natural curators, the engagement
was inept, and void in law. This precipitate measure, he added, had
produced a very bad effect upon Lady Ashton’s mind, which it was
impossible at present to remove. Her son, Colonel Douglas Ashton, had
embraced her prejudices in the fullest extent, and it was impossible for
Sir William to adopt a course disagreeable to them without a fatal and
irreconcilable breach in his family; which was not at present to be
thought of. Time, the great physician, he hoped, would mend all.

In a postscript, Sir William said something more explicitly, which
seemed to intimate that, rather than the law of Scotland should sustain
a severe wound through his sides, by a reversal of the judgment of her
supreme courts, in the case of the barony of Ravenswood, through the
intervention of what, with all submission, he must term a foreign court
of appeal, he himself would extrajudically consent to considerable
sacrifices.

From Lucy Ashton, by some unknown conveyance, the Master received the
following lines: “I received yours, but it was at the utmost risk; do
not attempt to write again till better times. I am sore beset, but I
will be true to my word, while the exercise of my reason is vouchsafed
to me. That you are happy and prosperous is some consolation, and my
situation requires it all.” The note was signed “L.A.”

This letter filled Ravenswood with the most lively alarm. He made many
attempts, notwithstanding her prohibition, to convey letters to Miss
Ashton, and even to obtain an interview; but his plans were frustrated,
and he had only the mortification to learn that anxious and effectual
precautions had been taken to prevent the possibility of their
correspondence. The Master was the more distressed by these
circumstances, as it became impossible to delay his departure from
Scotland, upon the important mission which had been confided to him.
Before his departure, he put Sir William Ashton’s letter into the hands
of the Marquis of A----, who observed with a smile, that Sir William’s
day of grace was past, and that he had now to learn which side of the
hedge the sun had got to. It was with the greatest difficulty that
Ravenswood extorted from the Marquis a promise that he would compromise
the proceedings in Parliament, providing Sir William should be disposed
to acquiesce in a union between him and Lucy Ashton.

“I would hardly,” said the Marquis, “consent to your throwing away your
birthright in this manner, were I not perfectly confident that Lady
Ashton, or Lady Douglas, or whatever she calls herself, will, as
Scotchmen say, keep her threep; and that her husband dares not
contradict her.”

“But yet,” said the Master, “I trust your lordship will consider my
engagement as sacred.”

“Believe my word of honour,” said the Marquis, “I would be a friend even
to your follies; and having thus told you MY opinion, I will endeavour,
as occasion offers, to serve you according to your own.”

The master of Ravenswood could but thank his generous kinsman and
patron, and leave him full power to act in all his affairs. He departed
from Scotland upon his mission, which, it was supposed, might detain him
upon the continent for some months.




CHAPTER XXVIII.

     Was ever woman in this humor wooed?
     Was ever woman in this humour won?
     I’ll have her.

     Richard III.

TWELVE months had passed away since the Master of Ravenswood’s departure
for the continent, and, although his return to Scotland had been
expected in a much shorter space, yet the affairs of his mission,
or, according to a prevailing report, others of a nature personal to
himself, still detained him abroad. In the mean time, the altered state
of affairs in Sir William Ashton’s family may be gathered from the
following conversation which took place betwixt Bucklaw and his
confidential bottle companion and dependant, the noted Captain
Craigengelt. They were seated on either side of the huge
sepulchral-looking freestone chimney in the low hall at Girnington.
A wood fire blazed merrily in the grate; a round oaken table, placed
between them, supported a stoup of excellent claret, two rummer glasses,
and other good cheer; and yet, with all these appliances and means
to boot, the countenance of the patron was dubious, doubtful, and
unsatisfied, while the invention of his dependant was taxed to the
utmost to parry what he most dreaded, a fit, as he called it, of
the sullens, on the part of his protector. After a long pause, only
interrupted by the devil’s tattoo, which Bucklaw kept beating against
the hearth with the toe of his boot, Craigengelt at last ventured to
break silence. “May I be double distanced,” said he, “if ever I saw a
man in my life have less the air of a bridegroom! Cut me out of feather,
if you have not more the look of a man condemned to be hanged!”

“My kind thanks for the compliment,” replied Bucklaw; “but I suppose you
think upon the predicament in which you yourself are most likely to be
placed; and pray, Captain Craigengelt, if it please your worship, why
should I look merry, when I’m sad, and devilish sad too?”

“And that’s what vexes me,” said Craigengelt. “Here is this match, the
best in the whole country, and which were so anxious about, is on the
point of being concluded, and you are as sulky as a bear that has lost
its whelps.”

“I do not know,” answered the Laird, doggedly, “whether I should
conclude or not, if it was not that I am too far forwards to leap back.”

“Leap back!” exclaimed Craigengelt, with a well-assumed air of
astonishment, “that would be playing the back-game with a witness! Leap
back! Why, is not the girl’s fortune----”

“The young lady’s, if you please,” said Hayston, interrupting him.

“Well--well, no disrespect meant. Will Miss Ashton’s tocher not weigh
against any in Lothian?”

“Granted,” answered Bucklaw; “but I care not a penny for her tocher; I
have enough of my own.”

“And the mother, that loves you like her own child?”

“Better than some of her children, I believe,” said Bucklaw, “or there
would be little love wared on the matter.”

“And Colonel Sholto Douglas Ashton, who desires the marriage above all
earthly things?”

“Because,” said Bucklaw, “he expects to carry the county of ---- through
my interest.”

“And the father, who is as keen to see the match concluded as ever I
have been to win a main?”

“Ay,” said Bucklaw, in the same disparaging manner, “it lies with Sir
William’s policy to secure the next best match, since he cannot barter
his child to save the great Ravenswood estate, which the English House
of Lords are about to wrench out of his clutches.”

“What say you to the young lady herself?” said Craigengelt; “the finest
young woman in all Scotland, one that you used to be so fond of when she
was cross, and now she consents to have you, and gives up her engagement
with Ravenswood, you are for jibbing. I must say, the devil’s in ye,
when ye neither know what you would have nor what you would want.”

“I’ll tell you my meaning in a word,” answered Bucklaw, getting up and
walking through the room; “I want to know what the devil is the cause of
Miss Ashton’s changing her mind so suddenly?”

“And what need you care,” said Craigengelt, “since the change is in your
favour?”

“I’ll tell you what it is,” returned his patron, “I never knew much of
that sort of fine ladies, and I believe they may be as capricious as the
devil; but there is something in Miss Ashton’s change a devilish deal
too sudden and too serious for a mere flisk of her own. I’ll be bound,
Lady Ashton understands every machine for breaking in the human
mind, and there are as many as there are cannon-bit, martingales, and
cavessons for young colts.”

“And if that were not the case,” said Craigengelt, “how the devil should
we ever get them into training at all?”

“And that’s true too,” said Bucklaw, suspending his march through the
dining-room, and leaning upon the back of a chair. “And besides,
here’s Ravenswood in the way still, do you think he’ll give up Lucy’s
engagement?”

“To be sure he will,” answered Craigengelt; “what good can it do him to
refuse, since he wishes to marry another woman and she another man?”

“And you believe seriously,” said Bucklaw, “that he is going to marry
the foreign lady we heard of?”

“You heard yourself,” answered Craigengelt, “what Captain Westenho said
about it, and the great preparation made for their blythesome bridal.”

“Captain Westenho,” replied Bucklaw, “has rather too much of your own
cast about, Craigie, to make what Sir William would call a ‘famous
witness.’ He drinks deep, plays deep, swears deep, and I suspect can lie
and cheat a little into the bargain; useful qualities, Craigie, if
kept in their proper sphere, but which have a little too much of the
freebooter to make a figure in a court of evidence.”

“Well, then,” said Craigengelt, “will you believe Colonel Douglas
Ashton, who heard the Marquis of A---- say in a public circle, but not
aware that he was within ear-shot, that his kinsman had made a
better arrangement for himself than to give his father’s land for the
pale-cheeked daughter of a broken-down fanatic, and that Bucklaw was
welcome to the wearing of Ravenswood’s shaughled shoes.”

“Did he say so, by heavens!” cried Bucklaw, breaking out into one of
those incontrollable fits of passion to which he was constitutionally
subject; “if I had heard him, I would have torn the tongue out of his
throat before all his peats and minions, and Highland bullies into the
bargain. Why did not Ashton run him through the body?”

“Capot me if I know,” said the Captain. “He deserved it sure enough; but
he is an old man, and a minister of state, and there would be more risk
than credit in meddling with him. You had more need to think of making
up to Miss Lucy Ashton the disgrace that’s like to fall upon her than of
interfering with a man too old to fight, and on too high a tool for your
hand to reach him.”

“It SHALL reach him, though, one day,” said Bucklaw, “and his kinsman
Ravenswood to boot. In the mean time, I’ll take care Miss Ashton
receives no discredit for the slight they have put upon her. It’s an
awkward job, however, and I wish it were ended; I scarce know how to
talk to her,--but fill a bumper, Craigie, and we’ll drink her health.
It grows late, and a night-cowl of good claret is worth all the
considering-caps in Europe.”




CHAPTER XXIX.

     It was the copy of our conference.
     In bed she slept not, for my urging it;
     At board she fed not, for my urging it;
     Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
     In company I often glanced at it.

     Comedy of Errors.

THE next morning saw Bucklaw and his faithful Achates, Craigengelt, at
Ravenswood Castle. They were most courteously received by the knight
and his lady, as well, as by their son and heir, Colonel Ashton. After
a good deal of stammering and blushing--for Bucklaw, notwithstanding his
audacity in other matters, had all the sheepish bashfulness common to
those who have lived little in respectable society--he contrived at
length to explain his wish to be admitted to a conference with Miss
Ashton upon the subject of their approaching union. Sir William and
his son looked at Lady Ashton, who replied with the greatest composure,
“That Lucy would wait upon Mr. Hayston directly. I hope,” she added with
a smile, “that as Lucy is very young, and has been lately trepanned into
an engagement of which she is now heartily ashamed, our dear Bucklaw
will excuse her wish that I should be present at their interview?”

“In truth, my dear lady,” said Bucklaw, “it is the very thing that
I would have desired on my own account; for I have been so little
accustomed to what is called gallantry, that I shall certainly fall into
some cursed mistake unless I have the advantage of your ladyship as an
interpreter.”

It was thus that Bucklaw, in the perturbation of his embarrassment upon
this critical occasion, forgot the just apprehensions he had entertained
of Lady Ashton’s overbearing ascendency over her daughter’s mind, and
lost an opportunity of ascertaining, by his own investigation, the real
state of Lucy’s feelings.

The other gentlemen left the room, and in a short time Lady Ashton,
followed by her daughter, entered the apartment. She appeared, as he had
seen her on former occasions, rather composed than agitated; but a nicer
judge than he could scarce have determined whether her calmness was that
of despair or of indifference. Bucklaw was too much agitated by his own
feelings minutely to scrutinise those of the lady. He stammered out an
unconnected address, confounding together the two or three topics to
which it related, and stopt short before he brought it to any regular
conclusion. Miss Ashton listened, or looked as if she listened, but
returned not a single word in answer, continuing to fix her eyes on
a small piece of embroidery on which, as if by instinct or habit, her
fingers were busily employed. Lady Ashton sat at some distance, almost
screened from notice by the deep embrasure of the window in which she
had placed her chair. From this she whispered, in a tone of voice
which, though soft and sweet, had something in it of admonition, if not
command: “Lucy, my dear, remember--have you heard what Bucklaw has been
saying?”

The idea of her mother’s presence seemed to have slipped from the
unhappy girl’s recollection. She started, dropped her needle, and
repeated hastily, and almost in the same breath, the contradictory
answers: “Yes, madam--no, my lady--I beg pardon, I did not hear.”

“You need not blush, my love, and still less need you look so pale and
frightened,” said Lady Ashton, coming forward; “we know that maiden’s
ears must be slow in receiving a gentleman’s language; but you must
remember Mr. Hayston speaks on a subject on which you have long since
agreed to give him a favourable hearing. You know how much your father
and I have our hearts set upon an event so extremely desirable.”

In Lady Ashton’s voice, a tone of impressive, and even stern, innuendo
was sedulously and skilfully concealed under an appearance of the most
affectionate maternal tenderness. The manner was for Bucklaw, who was
easily enough imposed upon; the matter of the exhortation was for the
terrified Lucy, who well knew how to interpret her mother’s hints,
however skilfully their real purport might be veiled from general
observation.

Miss Ashton sat upright in her chair, cast round her a glance in which
fear was mingled with a still wilder expression, but remained perfectly
silent. Bucklaw, who had in the mean time paced the room to and fro,
until he had recovered his composure, now stopped within two or three
yards of her chair, and broke out as follows: “I believe I have been a
d--d fool, Miss Ashton; I have tried to speak to you as people tell me
young ladies like to be talked to, and I don’t think you comprehend
what I have been saying; and no wonder, for d--n me if I understand it
myself! But, however, once for all, and in broad Scotch, your father and
mother like what is proposed, and if you can take a plain young fellow
for your husband, who will never cross you in anything you have a mind
to, I will place you at the head of the best establishment in the three
Lothians; you shall have Lady Girnington’s lodging in the Canongate of
Edinburgh, go where you please, do what you please, and see what you
please--and that’s fair. Only I must have a corner at the board-end for
a worthless old playfellow of mine, whose company I would rather want
than have, if it were not that the d--d fellow has persuaded me that I
can’t do without him; and so I hope you won’t except against Craigie,
although it might be easy to find much better company.”

“Now, out upon you, Bucklaw,” said Lady Ashton, again interposing;
“how can you think Lucy can have any objection to that blunt, honest,
good-natured creature, Captain Craigengelt?”

“Why, madam,” replied Bucklaw, “as to Craigie’s sincerity, honesty, and
good-nature, they are, I believe, pretty much upon a par; but that’s
neither here nor there--the fellow knows my ways, and has got useful to
me, and I cannot well do without him, as I said before. But all this is
nothing to the purpose; for since I have mustered up courage to make a
plain proposal, I would fain hear Miss Ashton, from her own lips, give
me a plain answer.”

“My dear Bucklaw,” said Lady Ashton, “let me spare Lucy’s bashfulness.
I tell you, in her presence, that she has already consented to be guided
by her father and me in this matter. Lucy, my love,” she added, with
that singular combination of suavity of tone and pointed energy which we
have already noticed--“Lucy, my dearest love! speak for yourself, is it
not as I say?”

Her victim answered in a tremulous and hollow voice: “I HAVE promised to
obey you--but upon one condition.”

“She means,” said Lady Ashton, turning to Bucklaw, “she expects an
answer to the demand which she has made upon the man at Vienna, or
Ratisbon, or Paris--or where is he?--for restitution of the engagement
in which he had the art to involve her. You will not, I am sure, my dear
friend, think it is wrong that she should feel much delicacy upon this
head; indeed, it concerns us all.”

“Perfectly right--quite fair,” said Bucklaw, half humming, half speaking
the end of the old song--

     “It is best to be off wi’ the old love
     Before you be on wi’ the new.

But I thought,” said he, pausing, “you might have had an answer six
times told from Ravenswood. D--n me, if I have not a mind to go fetch
one myself, if Miss Ashton will honour me with the commission.”

“By no means,” said Lady Ashton; “we have had the utmost difficulty of
preventing Douglas, for whom it would be more proper, from taking so
rash a step; and do you think we could permit you, my good friend,
almost equally dear to us, to go to a desperate man upon an errand so
desperate? In fact, all the friends of the family are of opinion, and my
dear Lucy herself ought so to think, that, as this unworthy person has
returned no answer to her letter, silence must on this, as in other
cases, be held to give consent, and a contract must be supposed to be
given up, when the party waives insisting upon it. Sir William, who
should know best, is clear upon this subject; and therefore, my dear
Lucy----”

“Madam,” said Lucy, with unwonted energy, “urge me no farther; if this
unhappy engagement be restored, I have already said you shall dispose
of me as you will; till then I should commit a heavy sin in the sight
of God and man in doing what you require.” “But, my love, if this man
remains obstinately silent----”

“He will NOT be silent,” answered Lucy; “it is six weeks since I sent
him a double of my former letter by a sure hand.”

“You have not--you could not--you durst not,” said Lady Ashton, with
violence inconsistent with the tone she had intended to assume; but
instantly correcting herself, “My dearest Lucy,” said she, in her
sweetest tone of expostulation, “how could you think of such a thing?”

“No matter,” said Bucklaw; “I respect Miss Ashton for her sentiments,
and I only wish I had been her messenger myself.”

“And pray how long, Miss Ashton,” said her mother, ironically, “are
we to wait the return of your Pacolet--your fairy messenger--since our
humble couriers of flesh and blood could not be trusted in this matter?”

“I have numbered weeks, days, hours, and minutes,” said Miss Ashton;
“within another week I shall have an answer, unless he is dead. Till
that time, sir,” she said, addressing Bucklaw, “let me be thus far
beholden to you, that you will beg my mother to forbear me upon this
subject.”

“I will make it my particular entreaty to Lady Ashton,” said Bucklaw.
“By my honour, madam, I respect your feelings; and, although the
prosecution of this affair be rendered dearer to me than ever, yet, as
I am a gentleman, I would renounce it, were it so urged as to give you a
moment’s pain.”

“Mr. Hayston, I think, cannot comprehend that,” said Lady Ashton,
looking pale with anger, “when the daughter’s happiness lies in the
bosom of the mother. Let me ask you, Miss Ashton, in what terms your
last letter was couched?”

“Exactly in the same, madam,” answered Lucy, “which you dictated on a
former occasion.”

“When eight days have elapsed, then,” said her mother, resuming her tone
of tenderness, “we shall hope, my dearest love, that you will end this
suspense.”

“Miss Ashton must not be hurried, madam,” said Bucklaw, whose bluntness
of feeling did not by any means arise from want of good-nature;
“messengers may be stopped or delayed. I have known a day’s journey
broke by the casting of a foreshoe. Stay, let me see my calendar: the
twentieth day from this is St. Jude’s, and the day before I must be at
Caverton Edge, to see the match between the Laird of Kittlegirth’s black
mare and Johnston the meal-monger’s four-year-old-colt; but I can ride
all night, or Craigie can bring me word how the match goes; and I hope,
in the mean time, as I shall not myself distress Miss Ashton with any
further importunity, that your ladyship yourself, and Sir William, and
Colonel Douglas will have the goodness to allow her uninterrupted time
for making up her mind.”

“Sir,” said Miss Ashton, “you are generous.”

“As for that, madam,” answered Bucklaw, “I only pretend to be a plain,
good-humoured young fellow, as I said before, who will willingly make you
happy if you will permit him, and show him how to do so.” Having said
this, he saluted her with more emotion than was consistent with
his usual train of feeling, and took his leave; Lady Ashton, as she
accompanied him out of the apartment, assuring him that her daughter did
full justice to the sincerity of his attachment, and requesting him to
see Sir William before his departure, “since,” as she said, with a keen
glance reverting towards Lucy, “against St. Jude’s day, we must all be
ready to SIGN AND SEAL.”

“To sign and seal!” echoed Lucy, in a muttering tone, as the door of the
apartment closed--“to sign and seal--to do and die!” and, clasping her
extenuated hands together, she sunk back on the easy-chair she occupied,
in a state resembling stupor.

From this she was shortly after awakened by the boisterous entry of her
brother Henry, who clamorously reminded her of a promise to give him
two yards of carnation ribbon to make knots to his new garters. With the
most patient composure Lucy arose, and opening a little ivory cabinet,
sought out the ribbon the lad waned, measured it accurately, cut it off
into proper lengths, and knotted it into the fashion his boyish whim
required.

“Dinna shut the cabinet yet,” said Henry, “for I must have some of your
silver wire to fasten the bells to my hawk’s jesses,--and yet the new
falcon’s not worth them neither; for do you know, after all the plague
we had to get her from an eyrie, all the way at Posso, in Mannor Water,
she’s going to prove, after all, nothing better than a rifler: she just
wets her singles in the blood of the partridge, and then breaks away,
and lets her fly; and what good can the poor bird do after that, you
know, except pine and die in the first heather-cow or whin-bush she can
crawl into?”

“Right, Henry--right--very right,” said Luch, mournfully, holding the
boy fast by the hand, after she had given him the wire he wanted; “but
there are more riflers in the world than your falcon, and more wounded
birds that seek but to die in quiet, that can find neither brake nor
whin-bush to hide their head in.”

“Ah! that’s some speech out of your romances,” said the boy; “and Sholto
says they have turned your head. But I hear Norman whistling to the
hawk; I must go fasten on the jesses.”

And he scampered away with the thoughtless gaiety of boyhood, leaving
his sister to the bitterness of her own reflections.

“It is decreed,” she said, “that every living creature, even those who
owe me most kindness, are to shun me, and leave me to those by whom I am
beset. It is just it should be thus. Alone and uncounselled, I involved
myself in these perils; alone and uncounselled, I must extricate myself
or die.”




CHAPTER XXX.

     What doth ensue
     But moody and dull melancholy,
     Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
     And at her heel, a huge infectious troop
     Of pale distemperatures, and foes to life?

     Comedy of Errors.

AS some vindication of the ease with which Bucklaw (who otherwise, as
he termed himself, was really a very good-humoured fellow) resigned his
judgment to the management of Lady Ashton, while paying his addresses
to her daughter, the reader must call to mind the strict domestic
discipline which, at this period, was exercised over the females of a
Scottish family.

The manners of the country in this, as in many other respects, coincided
with those of France before the Revolution. Young women of the higher
rank seldom mingled in society until after marriage, and, both in law
and fact, were held to be under the strict tutelage of their parents,
who were too apt to enforce the views for their settlement in life
without paying any regard to the inclination of the parties chiefly
interested. On such occasions, the suitor expected little more from his
bride than a silent acquiescence in the will of her parents; and as few
opportunities of acquaintance, far less of intimacy, occurred, he made
his choice by the outside, as the lovers in the Merchant of Venice
select the casket, contented to trust to chance the issue of the lottery
in which he had hazarded a venture.

It was not therefore surprising, such being the general manners of the
age, that Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw, whom dissipated habits had detached
in some degree from the best society, should not attend particularly to
those feelings in his elected bride to which many men of more sentiment,
experience, and reflection would, in all probability, have been equally
indifferent. He knew what all accounted the principal point, that her
parents and friends, namely, were decidedly in his favour, and that
there existed most powerful reasons for their predilection.

In truth, the conduct of the Marquis of A----, since Ravenswood’s
departure, had been such as almost to bar the possibility of his
kinsman’s union with Lucy Ashton. The Marquis was Ravenswood’s sincere
but misjudging friend; or rather, like many friends and patrons,
he consulted what he considered to be his relation’s true interest,
although he knew that in doing so he ran counter to his inclinations.

The Marquis drove on, therefore, with the plentitude of ministerial
authority, an appeal to the British House of Peers against those
judgments of the courts of law by which Sir William became possessed of
Ravenswood’s hereditary property. As this measure, enforced with all the
authority of power, was new in Scottish judicial proceedings, though now
so frequently resorted to, it was exclaimed against by the lawyers
on the opposite side of politics, as an interference with the civil
judicature of the country, equally new, arbitrary, and tyrannical. And
if it thus affected even strangers connected with them only by political
party, it may be guessed what the Ashton family themselves said
and thought under so gross a dispensation. Sir William, still more
worldly-minded than he was timid, was reduced to despair by the loss
by which he was threatened. His son’s haughtier spirit was exalted into
rage at the idea of being deprived of his expected patrimony. But to
Lady Ashton’s yet more vindictive temper the conduct of Ravenswood, or
rather of his patron, appeared to be an offence challenging the deepest
and most immortal revenge. Even the quiet and confiding temper of Lucy
herself, swayed by the opinions expressed by all around her, could not
but consider the conduct of Ravenswood as precipitate, and even unkind.
“It was my father,” she repeated with a sigh, “who welcomed him to this
place, and encouraged, or at least allowed, the intimacy between us.
Should he not have remembered this, and requited it with at least some
moderate degree of procrastination in the assertion of his own alleged
rights? I would have forfeited for him double the value of these lands,
which he pursues with an ardour that shows he has forgotten how much I
am implicated in the matter.”

Lucy, however, could only murmur these things to herself, unwilling to
increase the prejudices against her lover entertained by all around
her, who exclaimed against the steps pursued on his account as illegal,
vexatious, and tyrannical, resembling the worst measures in the worst
times of the worst Stuarts, and a degradation of Scotland, the decisions
of whose learned judges were thus subjected to the review of a court
composed indeed of men of the highest rank, and who were not trained to
the study of any municipal law, and might be supposed specially to hold
in contempt that of Scotland. As a natural consequence of the alleged
injustice meditated towards her father, every means was restored to, and
every argument urged to induce Miss Ashton to break off her engagement
with Ravenswood, as being scandalous, shameful, and sinful, formed with
the mortal enemy of her family, and calculated to add bitterness to the
distress of her parents.

Lucy’s spirit, however, was high, and, although unaided and alone,
she could have borne much: she could have endured the repinings of her
father; his murmurs against what he called the tyrannical usage of the
ruling party; his ceaseless charges of ingratitude against Ravenswood;
his endless lectures on the various means by which contracts may be
voided and annulled; his quotations from the civil, municipal, and the
canon law; and his prelections upon the patria potestas.

She might have borne also in patience, or repelled with scorn, the
bitter taunts and occasional violence of her brother, Colonel Douglas
Ashton, and the impertinent and intrusive interference of other friends
and relations. But it was beyond her power effectually to withstand or
elude the constant and unceasing persecution of Lady Ashton, who, laying
every other wish aside, had bent the whol efforts of her powerful
mind to break her daughter’s contract with Ravenswood, and to place
a perpetual bar between the lovers, by effecting Lucy’s union with
Bucklaw. Far more deeply skilled than her husband in the recesses of the
human heart, she was aware that in this way she might strike a blow of
deep and decisive vengeance upon one whom she esteemed as her mortal
enemy; nor did she hesitate at raising her arm, although she knew that
the wound must be dealt through the bosom of her daughter. With this
stern and fixed purpose, she sounded every deep and shallow of her
daughter’s soul, assumed alternately every disguise of manner which
could serve her object, and prepared at leisure every species of dire
machinery by which the human mind can be wrenched from its settled
determination. Some of these were of an obvious description, and require
only to be cursorily mentioned; others were characteristic of the time,
the country, and the persons engaged in this singular drama.

It was of the last consequence that all intercourse betwixt the lovers
should be stopped, and, by dint of gold and authority, Lady Ashton
contrived to possess herself of such a complete command of all who were
placed around her daughter, that, if fact, no leaguered fortress was
ever more completely blockaded; while, at the same time, to all outward
appearance Miss Ashton lay under no restriction. The verge of her
parents’ domains became, in respect to her, like the viewless and
enchanted line drawn around a fairy castle, where nothing unpermitted
can either enter from without or escape from within. Thus every letter,
in which Ravenswood conveyed to Lucy Ashton the indispensable reasons
which detained him abroad, and more than one note which poor Lucy had
addressed to him through what she thought a secure channel, fell into
the hands of her mother. It could not be but that the tenor of these
intercepted letters, especially those of Ravenswood, should contain
something to irritate the passions and fortify the obstinacy of her into
whose hands they fell; but Lady Ashton’s passions were too deep-rooted
to require this fresh food. She burnt the papers as regularly as she
perused them; and as they consumed into vapour and tinder, regarded them
with a smile upon her compressed lips, and an exultation in her steady
eye, which showed her confidence that the hopes of the writers should
soon be rendered equally unsubstantial.

It usually happens that fortune aids the machinations of those who are
prompt to avail themselves of every chance that offers. A report was
wafted from the continent, founded, like others of the same sort, upon
many plausible circumstances, but without any real basis, stating the
Master of Ravenswood to be on the eve of marriage with a foreign lady
of fortune and distinction. This was greedily caught up by both the
political parties, who were at once struggling for power and for popular
favour, and who seized, as usual, upon the most private circumstances
in the lives of each other’s partisans to convert them into subjects of
political discussion.

The Marquis of A---- gave his opinion aloud and publicly, not indeed in
the coarse terms ascribed to him by Captain Craigengelt, but in a manner
sufficiently offensive to the Ashtons. “He thought the report,” he said,
“highly probably, and heartily wished it might be true. Such a match
was fitter and far more creditable for a spirited young fellow than a
marriage with the daughter of an old Whig lawyer, whose chicanery had so
nearly ruined his father.”

The other party, of course, laying out of view the opposition which the
Master of Ravenswood received from Miss Ashton’s family, cried shame
upon his fickleness and perfidy, as if he had seduced the young lady
into an engagement, and wilfully and causelessly abandoned her for
another.

Sufficient care was taken that this report should find its way to
Ravenswood Castle through every various channel, Lady Ashton being
well aware that the very reiteration of the same rumour, from so many
quarters, could not but give it a semblance of truth. By some it was
told as a piece of ordinary news, by some communicated as serious
intelligence; now it was whispered to Lucy Ashton’s ear in the tone of
malignant pleasantry, and now transmitted to her as a matter of grave
and serious warning.

Even the boy Henry was made the instrument of adding to his sister’s
torments. One morning he rushed into the room with a willow branch in
his hand, which he told her had arrived that instant from Germany for
her special wearing. Lucy, as we have seen, was remarkably fond of
her younger brother, and at that moment his wanton and thoughtless
unkindness seemed more keenly injurious than even the studied insults of
her elder brother. Her grief, however, had no shade of resentment; she
folded her arms about the boy’s neck, and saying faintly, “Poor Henry!
you speak but what they tell you” she burst into a flood of unrestrained
tears. The boy was moved, notwithstanding the thoughtlessness of his age
and character. “The devil take me,” said he, “Lucy, if I fetch you any
more of these tormenting messages again; for I like you better,” said
he, kissing away the tears, “than the whole pack of them; and you shall
have my grey pony to ride on, and you shall canter him if you like--ay,
and ride beyond the village, too, if you have a mind.”

“Who told you,” said Lucy, “that I am not permitted to ride where I
please?”

“That’s a secret,” said the boy; “but you will find you can never ride
beyond the village but your horse will cast a shoe, or fall lame, or the
cattle bell will ring, or something will happen to bring you back. But
if I tell you more of these things, Douglas will nto get me the pair of
colours they have promised me, and so good-morrow to you.”

This dialogue plunged Lucy in still deeper dejection, as it tended to
show her plainly what she had for some time suspected, that she was
little better than a prisoner at large in her father’s house. We have
described her in the outset of our story as of a romantic disposition,
delighting in tales of love and wonder, and readily identifying herself
with the situation of those legendary heroines with whose adventures,
for want of better reading, her memory had become stocked. The fairy
wand, with which in her solitude she had delighted to raise visions of
enchantment, became now the rod of a magician, the bond slave of evil
_genii_, serving only to invoke spectres at which the exorcist trembled.
She felt herself the object of suspicion, of scorn, of dislike at least,
if not of hatred, to her own family; and it seemed to her that she was
abandoned by the very person on whose account she was exposed to
the enmity of all around her. Indeed, the evidence of Ravenswood’s
infidelity began to assume every day a more determined character.
A soldier of fortune, of the name of Westenho, an old familiar of
Craigengelt’s, chanced to arrive from abroad about this time. The worthy
Captain, though without any precise communication with Lady Ashton,
always acted most regularly and sedulously in support of her plans,
and easily prevailed upon his friend, by dint of exaggeration of real
circumstances and coming of others, to give explicit testimony to the
truth of Ravenswood’s approaching marriage.

Thus beset on all hands, and in a manner reduced to despair, Lucy’s
temper gave way under the pressure of constant affliction and
persecution. She became gloomy and abstracted, and, contrary to her
natural and ordinary habit of mind, sometimes turned with spirit, and
even fierceness, on those by whom she was long and closely annoyed. Her
health also began to be shaken, and her hectic cheek and wandering
eye gave symptoms of what is called a fever upon the spirits. In most
mothers this would have moved compassion; but Lady Ashton, compact and
firm of purpose, saw these waverings of health and intellect with no
greater sympathy than that with which the hostile engineer regards the
towers of a beleaguered city as they reel under the discharge of his
artillery; or rather, she considered these starts and inequalities of
temper as symptoms of Lucy’s expiring resolution; as the angler, by the
throes and convulsive exertions of the fish which he has hooked,
becomes aware that he soon will be able to land him. To accelerate
the catastrophe in the present case, Lady Ashton had recourse to an
expedient very consistent with the temper and credulity of those times,
but which the reader will probably pronounce truly detestable and
diabolical.




CHAPTER XXXI.

     In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weeds,
     And wilful want, all careless of her deeds;
     So choosing solitary to abide,
     Far from all neighbours, that her devilish deeds
     And hellish arts from people she might hide,
     And hurt far off, unknown, whome’er she envied.

     Faerie Queene.

THE health of Lucy Ashton soon required the assistance of a person more
skilful in the office of a sick-nurse than the female domestics of the
family. Ailsie Gourlay, sometimes called the Wise Woman of Bowden, was
the person whom, for her own strong reasons, Lady Ashton selected as an
attendant upon her daughter.

This woman had acquired a considerable reputation among the ignorant by
the pretended cures which she performed, especially in “oncomes,” as
the Scotch call them, or mysterious diseases, which baffle the regular
physician. Her pharmacopoeia consisted partly of herbs selected in
planetary hours, partly of words, signs, and charms, which sometimes,
perhaps, produced a favourable influence upon the imagination of her
patients. Such was the avowed profession of Luckie Gourlay, which, as
may well be supposed, was looked upon with a suspicious eye, not only
by her neighbours, but even by the clergy of the district. In
private, however, she traded more deeply in the occult sciences; for,
notwithstanding the dreadful punishments inflicted upon the supposed
crime of witchcraft, there wanted not those who, steeled by want and
bitterness of spirit, were willing to adopt the hateful and dangerous
character, for the sake of the influence which its terrors enabled them
to exercise in the vicinity, and the wretched emolument which they could
extract by the practice of their supposed art.

Ailsie Gourlay was not indeed fool enough to acknowledge a compact with
the Evil One, which would have been a swift and ready road to the stake
and tar-barrel. Her fairy, she said, like Caliban’s, was a harmless
fairy. Nevertheless, she “spaed fortunes,” read dreams, composed
philtres, discovered stolen goods, and made and dissolved matches as
successfully as if, according to the belief of the whole neighbourhood,
she had been aided in those arts by Beelzebub himself. The worst of the
pretenders to these sciences was, that they were generally persons who,
feeling themselves odious to humanity, were careless of what they did
to deserve the public hatred. Real crimes were often committed under
pretence of magical imposture; and it somewhat relieves the disgust
with which we read, in the criminal records, the conviction of
these wretches, to be aware that many of them merited, as poisoners,
suborners, and diabolical agents in secret domestic crimes, the severe
fate to which they were condemned for the imaginary guilt of witchcraft.

Such was Aislie Gourlay, whom, in order to attain the absolute
subjugation of Lucy Ashton’s mind, her mother thought it fitting to
place near her person. A woman of less consequence than Lady Ashton
had not dared to take such a step; but her high rank and strength of
character set her above the censure of the world, and she was allowed to
have selected for her daughter’s attendant the best and most experienced
sick-nurse and “mediciner” in the neighbourhood, where an inferior
person would have fallen under the reproach of calling in the assistance
of a partner and ally of the great Enemy of mankind.

The beldam caught her cue readily and by innuendo, without giving
Lady Ashton the pain of distinct explanation. She was in many respects
qualified for the part she played, which indeed could not be efficiently
assumed without some knowledge of the human heart and passions. Dame
Gourlay perceived that Lucy shuddered at her external appearance, which
we have already described when we found her in the death-chamber of
blind Alice; and while internally she hated the poor girl for the
involuntary horror with which she saw she was regarded, she commenced
her operations by endeavouring to efface or overcome those prejudices
which, in her heart, she resented as mortal offences. This was easily
done, for the hag’s external ugliness was soon balanced by a show of
kindness and interest, to which Lucy had of late been little accustomed;
her attentive services and real skill gained her the ear, if not the
confidence, of her patient; and under pretence of diverting the solitude
of a sick-room, she soon led her attention captive by the legends in
which she was well skilled, and to which Lucy’s habit of reading and
reflection induced her to “lend an attentive ear.” Dame Gourlay’s tales
were at first of a mild and interesting character--

     Of fays that nightly dance upon the wold,
     And lovers doom’d to wander and to weep,
     And castles high, where wicked wizards keep
     Their captive thralls.

Gradually, however, they assumed a darker and more mysterious character,
and became such as, told by the midnight lamp, and enforced by the
tremulous tone, the quivering and livid lip, the uplifted skinny
forefinger, and the shaking head of the blue-eyed hag, might have
appalled a less credulous imagination in an age more hard of belief. The
old Sycorax saw her advantage, and gradually narrowed her magic circle
around the devoted victim on whose spirit she practised. Her legends
began to relate to the fortunes of the Ravenswood family, whose ancient
grandeur and portentous authority credulity had graced with so many
superstitious attributes. The story of the fatal fountain was narrated
at full length, and with formidable additions, by the ancient sibyl. The
prophecy, quoted by Caleb, concerning the dead bride who was to be won
by the last of the Ravenswoods, had its own mysterious commentary;
and the singular circumstance of the apparition seen by the Master of
Ravenswood in the forest, having partly transpired through his
hasty inquiries in the cottage of Old Alice, formed a theme for many
exaggerations.

Lucy might have despised these tales if they had been related concerning
another family, or if her own situation had been less despondent. But
circumstanced as she was, the idea that an evil fate hung over her
attachment became predominant over her other feelings; and the gloom
of superstition darkened a mind already sufficiently weakened by
sorrow, distress, uncertainty, and an oppressive sense of desertion and
desolation. Stories were told by her attendant so closely resembling her
own in their circumstances, that she was gradually led to converse upon
such tragic and mystical subjects with the beldam, and to repose a sort
of confidence in the sibyl, whom she still regarded with involuntary
shuddering. Dame Gourlay knew how to avail herself of this imperfect
confidence. She directed Lucy’s thoughts to the means of inquiring into
futurity--the surest mode perhaps, of shaking the understanding and
destroying the spirits. Omens were expounded, dreams were interpreted,
and other tricks of jugglery perhaps resorted to, by which the pretended
adepts of the period deceived and fascinated their deluded followers. I
find it mentioned in the articles of distay against Ailsie Gourlay--for
it is some comfort to know that the old hag was tried, condemned, and
burned on the top of North Berwick Law, by sentence of a commission
from the privy council--I find, I say, it was charged against her, among
other offences, that she had, by the aid and delusions of Satan, shown
to a young person of quality, in a mirror glass, a gentleman then
abroad, to whom the said young person was betrothed, and who appeared in
the vision to be in the act of bestowing his hand upon another lady. But
this and some other parts of the record appear to have been studiously
left imperfect in names and dates, probably out of regard to the honour
of the families concerned. If Dame Gourlay was able actually to play
off such a piece of jugglery, it is clear she must have had better
assistance to practise the deception than her own skill or funds could
supply. Meanwhile, this mysterious visionary traffic had its usual
effect in unsettling Miss Ashton’s mind. Her temper became unequal,
her health decayed daily, her manners grew moping, melancholy,
and uncertain. Her father, guessing partly at the cause of these
appearances, made a point of banishing Dame Gourlay from the castle;
but the arrow was shot, and was rankling barb-deep in the side of the
wounded deer.

It was shortly after the departure of this woman, that Lucy Ashton,
urged by her parents, announced to them, with a vivacity by which they
were startled, “That she was conscious heaven and earth and hell had set
themselves against her union with Ravenswood; still her contract,” she
said, “was a binding contract, and she neither would nor could resign
it without the consent of Ravenswood. Let me be assured,” she concluded,
“that he will free me from my engagement, and dispose of me as you
please, I care not how. When the diamonds are gone, what signifies the
casket?”

The tone of obstinacy with which this was said, her eyes flashing
with unnatural light, and her hands firmly clenched, precluded the
possibility of dispute; and the utmost length which Lady Ashton’s art
could attain, only got her the privilege of dictating the letter, by
which her daughter required to know of Ravenswood whether he intended to
abide by or to surrender what she termed “their unfortunate engagement.”
 Of this advantage Lady Ashton so far and so ingeniously availed herself
that, according to the wording of the letter, the reader would have
supposed Lucy was calling upon her lover to renounce a contract which
was contrary to the interests and inclinations of both. Not trusting
even to this point of deception, Lady Ashton finally determined to
suppress the letter altogether, in hopes that Lucy’s impatience would
induce her to condemn Ravenswood unheard and in absence. In this she was
disappointed. The time, indeed, had long elapsed when an answer should
have been received from the continent. The faint ray of hope which still
glimmered in Lucy’s mind was well nigh extinguished. But the idea never
forsook her that her letter might not have been duly forwarded. One of
her mother’s new machinations unexpectedly furnished her with the means
of ascertaining what she most desired to know.

The female agent of hell having been dismissed from the castle, Lady
Ashton, who wrought by all variety of means, resolved to employ, for
working the same end on Lucy’s mind, an agent of a very different
character. This was no other than the Reverent Mr. Bide-the-Bent, a
presbyterian clergyman, formerly mentioned, of the very strictest
order and the most rigid orthodoxy, whose aid she called in, upon the
principle of the tyrant in the in the tragedy:

     I’ll have a priest shall preach her from her faith,
     And make it sin not to renounce that vow
     Which I’d have broken.

But Lady Ashton was mistaken in the agent she had selected. His
prejudices, indeed, were easily enlisted on her side, and it was no
difficult matter to make him regard with horror the prospect of a union
betwixt the daughter of a God-fearing, professing, and Presbyterian
family of distinction and the heir of a bloodthirsty prelatist and
persecutor, the hands of whose fathers had been dyed to the wrists in
the blood of God’s saints. This resembled, in the divine’s opinion, the
union of a Moabitish stranger with a daughter of Zion. But with all
the more severe prejudices and principles of his sect, Bide-the-Bent
possessed a sound judgment, and had learnt sympathy even in that very
school of persecution where the heart is so frequently hardened. In a
private interview with Miss Ashton, he was deeply moved by her distress,
and could not but admit the justice of her request to be permitted a
direct communication with Ravenswood upon the subject of their solemn
contract. When she urged to him the great uncertainty under which she
laboured whether her letter had been ever forwarded, the old man paced
the room with long steps, shook his grey head, rested repeatedly for a
space on his ivory-headed staff, and, after much hesitation, confessed
that he thought her doubts so reasonable that he would himself aid in
the removal of them.

“I cannot but opine, Miss Lucy,” he said, “that your worshipful lady
mother hath in this matter an eagerness whilk, although it ariseth
doubtless from love to your best interests here and hereafter, for the
man is of persecuting blood, and himself a persecutor, a Cavalier
or Malignant, and a scoffer, who hath no inheritance in Jesse;
nevertheless, we are commanded to do justice unto all, and to fulfil
our bond and covenant, as well to the stranger as to him who is in
brotherhood with us. Wherefore myself, even I myself, will be aiding
unto the delivery of your letter to the man Edgar Ravenswood, trusting
that the issue thereof may be your deliverance from the nets in which he
hath sinfully engaged you. And that I may do in this neither more nor
less than hath been warranted by your honourable parents, I pray you
to transcribe, without increment or subtraction, the letter formerly
expeded under the dictation of your right honourable mother; and I shall
put it into such sure course of being delivered, that if, honourable
young madam, you shall receive no answer, it will be necessary that
you conclude that the man meaneth in silence to abandon that naughty
contract, which, peradventure, he may be unwilling directly to restore.”

Lucy eagerly embraced the expedient of the worthy divine. A new letter
was written in the precise terms of the former, and consigned by Mr.
Bide-the-Bent to the charge of Saunders Moonshine, a zealous elder of
the church when on shore, and when on board his brig as bold a smuggler
as ever ran out a sliding bowsprit to the winds that blow betwixt
Campvere and the east coast of Scotland. At the recommendation of his
pastor, Saunders readily undertook that the letter should be securely
conveyed to the Master of Ravenswood at the court where he now resided.

This retrospect became necessary to explain the conference betwixt Miss
Ashton, her mother, and Bucklaw which we have detailed in a preceding
chapter.

Lucy was now like the sailor who, while drifting through a tempestuous
ocean, clings for safety to a single plank, his powers of grasping it
becoming every moment more feeble, and the deep darkness of the night
only checkered by the flashes of lightning, hissing as they show the
white tops of the billows, in which he is soon to be engulfed.

Week crept away after week, and day after day. St. Jude’s day arrived,
the last and protracted term to which Lucy had limited herself, and
there was neither letter nor news of Ravenswood.




CHAPTER XXXII.

     How fair these names, how much unlike they look
     To all the blurr’d subscriptions in my book!
     The bridegroom’s letters stand in row above,
     Tapering, yet straight, like pine-trees in his grove;
     While free and fine the bride’s appear below,
     As light and slender as her jessamines grow.

     CRABBE.

ST. JUDE’s day came, the term assigned by Lucy herself as the furthest
date of expectation, and, as we have already said, there were neither
letters from nor news of Ravenswood. But there were news of Bucklaw, and
of his trusty associate Craigengelt, who arrived early in the morning
for the completion of the proposed espousals, and for signing the
necessary deeds.

These had been carefully prepared under the revisal of Sir William
Ashton himself, it having been resolved, on account of the state of Miss
Ashton’s health, as it was said, that none save the parties immediately
interested should be present when the parchments were subscribed. It
was further determined that the marriage should be solemnised upon the
fourth day after signing the articles, a measure adopted by Lady Ashton,
in order that Lucy might have as little time as possible to recede or
relapse into intractability. There was no appearance, however, of
her doing either. She heard the proposed arrangement with the calm
indifference of despair, or rather with an apathy arising from the
oppressed and stupified state of her feelings. To an eye so unobserving
as that of Bucklaw, her demeanour had little more of reluctance than
might suit the character of a bashful young lady, who, however, he could
not disguise from himself, was complying with the choice of her friends
rather than exercising any personal predilection in his favour.

When the morning compliment of the bridegroom had been paid, Miss Ashton
was left for some time to herself; her mother remarking, that the deeds
must be signed before the hour of noon, in order that the marriage might
be happy. Lucy suffered herself to be attired for the occasion as the
taste of her attendants suggested, and was of course splendidly arrayed.
Her dress was composed of white satin and Brussels lace, and her
hair arranged with a profusion of jewels, whose lustre made a strange
contrast to the deadly paleness of her complexion, and to the trouble
which dwelt in her unsettled eye.

Her toilette was hardly finished ere Henry appeared, to conduct the
passive bride to the state apartment, where all was prepared for signing
the contract. “Do you know, sister,” he said, “I am glad you are to
have Bucklaw after all, instead of Ravenswood, who looked like a Spanish
grandee come to cut our throats and trample our bodies under foot.
And I am glad the broad seas are between us this day, for I shall never
forget how frightened I was when I took him for the picture of old Sir
Malise walked out of the canvas. Tell me true, are you not glad to be
fairly shot of him?”

“Ask me no questions, dear Henry,” said his unfortunate sister; “there
is little more can happen to make me either glad or sorry in this
world.”

“And that’s what all young brides say,” said Henry; “and so do not be
cast down, Lucy, for you’ll tell another tale a twelvemonth hence; and I
am to be bride’s-man, and ride before you to the kirk; and all our kith,
kin, and allies, and all Bucklaw’s, are to be mounted and in order; and
I am to have a scarlet laced coat, and a feathered hat, and a sword-belt,
double bordered with gold, and point d’Espagne, and a dagger instead of
a sword; and I should like a sword much better, but my father won’t
hear of it. All my things, and a hundred besides, are to come out from
Edinburgh to-night with old Gilbert and the sumpter mules; and I will
bring them and show them to you the instant they come.”

The boy’s chatter was here interrupted by the arrival of Lady Ashton,
somewhat alarmed at her daughter’s stay. With one of her sweetest
smiles, she took Lucy’s arm under her own.

There were only present, Sir William Ashton and Colonel Douglas Ashton,
the last in full regimentals; Bucklaw, in bridegroom trim; Craigengelt,
freshly equipt from top to toe by the bounty of his patron, and
bedizened with as much lace as might have become the dress of the Copper
Captain; together with the Rev. Mr. Bide-the-Bent; the presence of
a minister being, in strict Presbyterian families, an indispensable
requisite upon all occasions of unusual solemnity.

Wines and refreshments were placed on a table, on which the writings
were displayed, ready for signature.

But before proceeding either to business or refreshment, Mr.
Bide-the-Bent, at a signal from Sir William Ashton, invited the company
to join him in a short extemporary prayer, in which he implored a
blessing upon the contract now to be solemnised between the honourable
parties then present. With the simplicity of his times and profession,
which permitted strong personal allusions, he petitioned that the
wounded mind of one of these noble parties might be healed, in reward
of her compliance with the advice of her right honourable parents; and
that, as she had proved herself a child after God’s commandment, by
honouring her father and mother, she and hers might enjoy the promised
blessing--length of days in the land here, and a happy portion hereafter
in a better country. He prayed farther, that the bridegroom might
be weaned from those follies which seduced youth from the path of
knowledge; that he might cease to take delight in vain and unprofitable
company, scoffers, rioters, and those who sit late at the wine (here
Bucklaw winked at Craigengelt), and cease from the society that causeth
to err. A suitable supplication in behalf of Sir William and Lady Ashton
and their family concluded this religious address, which thus embraced
every individual present excepting Craigengelt, whom the worthy divine
probably considered as past all hopes of grace.

The business of the day now went forward: Sir William Ashton signed
the contract with legal solemnity and precision; his son, with military
nonchalance; and Bucklaw, having subscribed as rapidly as Craigengelt
could manage to turn the leaves, concluded by wiping his pen on that
worthy’s new laced cravat. It was now Miss Ashton’s turn to sign the
writings, and she was guided by her watchful mother to the table for
that purpose. At her first attempt, she began to write with a dry pen,
and when the circumstance was pointed out, seemed unable, after several
attempts, to dip it in the massive silver ink-standish, which stood full
before her. Lady Ashton’s vigilance hastened to supply the deficiency. I
have myself seen the fatal deed, and in the distinct characters in which
the name of Lucy Ashton is traced on each page there is only a very
slight tremulous irregularity, indicative of her state of mind at the
time of the subscription. But the last signature is incomplete, defaced,
and blotted; for, while her hand was employed in tracing it, the hasty
tramp of a horse was heard at the gate, succeeded by a step in the
outer gallery, and a voice which, in a commanding tone, bore down the
opposition of the menials. The pen dropped from Lucy’s fingers, as she
exclaimed with a faint shriek: “He is come--he is come!”




CHAPTER XXXIII.

     This by his tongue should be a Montague!
     Fetch me my rapier, boy;
     Now, by the faith and honour of my kin,
     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

     Romeo and Juliet.

HARDLY had Miss Ashton dropped the pen, when the door of the apartment
flew open, and the Master of Ravenswood entered the apartment.

Lockhard and another domestic, who had in vain attempted to oppose his
passage through the gallery or antechamber, were seen standing on the
threshold transfixed with surprise, which was instantly communicated to
the whole party in the state-room. That of Colonel Douglas Ashton was
mingled with resentment; that of Bucklaw with haughty and affected
indifference; the rest, even Lady Ashton herself, showed signs of
fear; and Lucy seemed stiffened to stone by this unexpected apparition.
Apparition it might well be termed, for Ravenswood had more the
appearance of one returned from the dead than of a living visitor.

He planted himself full in the middle of the apartment, opposite to the
table at which Lucy was seated, on whom, as if she had been alone in the
chamber, he bent his eyes with a mingled expression of deep grief and
deliberate indignation. His dark-coloured riding cloak, displaced from
one shoulder, hung around one side of his person in the ample folds of
the Spanish mantle. The rest of his rich dress was travel-soiled, and
deranged by hard riding. He had a sword by his side, and pistols in his
belt. His slouched hat, which he had not removed at entrance, gave
an additional gloom to his dark features, which, wasted by sorrow and
marked by the ghastly look communicated by long illness, added to a
countenance naturally somewhat stern and wild a fierce and even savage
expression. The matted and dishevelled locks of hair which escaped from
under his hat, together with his fixed and unmoved posture, made his
head more resemble that of a marble bust than that of a living man. He
said not a single word, and there was a deep silence in the company for
more than two minutes.

It was broken by Lady Ashton, who in that space partly recovered her
natural audacity. She demanded to know the cause of this unauthorised
intrusion.

“That is a question, madam,” said her son, “which I have the best right
to ask; and I must request of the Master of Ravenswood to follow me
where he can answer it at leisure.”

Bucklaw interposed, saying, “No man on earth should usurp his previous
right in demanding an explanation from the Master. Craigengelt,” he
added, in an undertone, “d--n ye, why do you stand staring as if you saw
a ghost? fetch me my sword from the gallery.”

“I will relinquish to none,” said Colonel Ashton, “my right of calling
to account the man who has offered this unparalleled affront to my
family.” “Be patient, gentlemen,” said Ravenswood, turning sternly
towards them, and waving his hand as if to impose silence on their
altercation. “If you are as weary of your lives as I am, I will find
time and place to pledge mine against one or both; at present, I have no
leisure for the disputes of triflers.”

“Triflers!” echoed Colonel Ashton, half unsheathing his sword, while
Bucklaw laid his hand on the hilt of that which Craigengelt had just
reached him.

Sir William Ashton, alarmed for his son’s safety, rushed between the
young men and Ravenswood, exclaiming: “My son, I command you--Bucklaw, I
entreat you--keep the peace, in the name of the Queen and of the law!”

“In the name of the law of God,” said Bide-the-Bent, advancing also with
uplifted hands between Bucklaw, the Colonel, and the object of their
resentment--“in the name of Him who brought peace on earth and good-will
to mankind, I implore--I beseech--I command you to forbear violence
towards each other! God hateth the bloodthirsty man; he who striketh
with the sword shall perish with the sword.”

“Do you take me for a dog, sir” said Colonel Ashton, turning fiercely
upon him, “or something more brutally stupid, to endure this insult in
my father’s house? Let me go, Bucklaw! He shall account to me, or, by
Heavens, I will stab him where he stands!”

“You shall not touch him here,” said Bucklaw; “he once gave me my
life, and were he the devil come to fly away with the whole house and
generation, he shall have nothing but fair play.”

The passions of the two young men thus counteracting each other
gave Ravenswood leisure to exclaim, in a stern and steady voice:
“Silence!--let him who really seeks danger take the fitting time when
it is to be found; my mission here will be shortly accomplished. Is THAT
your handwriting, madam?” he added in a softer tone, extending towards
Miss Ashton her last letter.

A faltering “Yes” seemed rather to escape from her lips than to be
uttered as a voluntary answer.

“And is THIS also your handwriting?” extending towards her the mutual
engagement.

Lucy remained silent. Terror, and a yet stronger and more confused
feeling, so utterly disturbed her understanding that she probably
scarcely comprehended the question that was put to her.

“If you design,” said Sir William Ashton, “to found any legal claim on
that paper, sir, do not expect to receive any answer to an extrajudicial
question.”

“Sir William Ashton,” said Ravenswood, “I pray you, and all who hear
me, that you will not mistake my purpose. If this young lady, of her own
free will, desires the restoration of this contract, as her letter
would seem to imply, there is not a withered leaf which this autumn wind
strews on the heath that is more valueless in my eyes. But I must and
will hear the truth from her own mouth; without this satisfaction I will
not leave this spot. Murder me by numbers you possibly may; but I am
an armed man--I am a desperate man, and I will not die without ample
vengeance. This is my resolution, take it as you may. I WILL hear her
determination from her own mouth; from her own mouth, alone, and without
witnesses, will I hear it. Now, choose,” he said, drawing his sword with
the right hand, and, with the left, by the same motion taking a pistol
from his belt and cocking it, but turning the point of one weapon and
the muzzle of the other to the ground--“choose if you will have this
hall floated with blood, or if you will grant me the decisive interview
with my affianced bride which the laws of God and the country alike
entitle me to demand.”

All recoiled at the sound of his voice and the determined action by
which it was accompanied; for the ecstasy of real desperation seldom
fails to overpower the less energetic passions by which it may be
opposed. The clergyman was the first to speak. “In the name of God,” he
said, “receive an overture of peace from the meanest of His servants.
What this honourable person demands, albeit it is urged with over
violence, hath yet in it something of reason. Let him hear from Miss
Lucy’s own lips that she hath dutifully acceded to the will of her
parents, and repenteth her of her covenant with him; and when he is
assured of this he will depart in peace unto his own dwelling, and
cumber us no more. Alas! the workings of the ancient Adam are strong
even in the regenerate; surely we should have long-suffering with those
who, being yet in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity, are swept
forward by the uncontrollable current of worldly passion. Let then, the
Master of Ravenswood have the interview on which he insisteth; it can
but be as a passing pang to this honourable maiden, since her faith is
now irrevocably pledged to the choice of her parents. Let it, I say, be
this: it belongeth to my functions to entreat your honours’ compliance
with this headling overture.”

“Never!” answered Lady Ashton, whose rage had now overcome her first
surprise and terror--“never shall this man speak in private with my
daughter, the affianced bride of another! pass from this room who will,
I remain here. I fear neither his violence nor his weapons, though some,”
 she said, glancing a look towards Colonel Ashton, “who bear my name
appear more moved by them.”

“For God’s sake, madam,” answered the worthy divine, “add not fuel to
firebrands. The Master of Ravenswood cannot, I am sure, object to your
presence, the young lady’s state of health being considered, and your
maternal duty. I myself will also tarry; peradventure my grey hairs may
turn away wrath.”

“You are welcome to do so, sir,” said Ravenswood; “and Lady Ashton is
also welcome to remain, if she shall think proper; but let all others
depart.”

“Ravenswood,” said Colonel Ashton, crossing him as he went out, “you
shall account for this ere long.”

“When you please,” replied Ravenswood.

“But I,” said Bucklaw, with a half smile, “have a prior demand on your
leisure, a claim of some standing.”

“Arrange it as you will,” said Ravenswood; “leave me but this day in
peace, and I will have no dearer employment on earth to-morrow than to
give you all the satisfaction you can desire.”

The other gentlemen left the apartment; but Sir William Ashton lingered.

“Master of Ravenswood,” he said, in a conciliating tone, “I think I have
not deserved that you should make this scandal and outrage in my family.
If you will sheathe your sword, and retire with me into my study, I will
prove to you, by the most satisfactory arguments, the inutility of your
present irregular procedure----”

“To-morrow, sir--to-morrow--to-morrow, I will hear you at length,”
 reiterated Ravenswood, interrupting him; “this day hath its own sacred
and indispensable business.”

He pointed to the door, and Sir William left the apartment.

Ravenswood sheathed his sword, uncocked and returned his pistol to his
belt; walked deliberately to the door of the apartment, which he bolted;
returned, raised his hat from his forehead, and gazing upon Lucy with
eyes in which an expression of sorrow overcame their late fierceness,
spread his dishevelled locks back from his face, and said, “Do you know
me, Miss Ashton? I am still Edgar Ravenswood.” She was silent, and he
went on with increasing vehemence: “I am still that Edgar Ravenswood
who, for your affection, renounced the dear ties by which injured honour
bound him to seek vengeance. I am that Ravenswood who, for your sake,
forgave, nay, clasped hands in friendship with, the oppressor and
pillager of his house, the traducer and murderer of his father.”

“My daughter,” answered Lady Ashton, interrupting him, “has no occasion
to dispute the identity of your person; the venom of your present
language is sufficient to remind her that she speaks with the mortal
enemy of her father.”

“I pray you to be patient, madam,” answered Ravenswood; “my answer
must come from her own lips. Once more, Miss Lucy Ashton, I am that
Ravenswood to whom you granted the solemn engagement which you now
desire to retract and cancel.”

Lucy’s bloodless lips could only falter out the words, “It was my
mother.”

“She speaks truly,” said Lady Ashton, “it WAS I who, authorised alike
by the laws of God and man, advised her, and concurred with her, to
set aside an unhappy and precipitate engagement, and to annul it by the
authority of Scripture itself.”

“Scripture!” said Ravenswood, scornfully.

“Let him hear the text,” said Lady Ashton, appealing to the divine, “on
which you yourself, with cautious reluctance, declared the nullity of
the pretended engagement insisted upon by this violent man.”

The clergyman took his clasped Bible from his pocket, and read the
following words: “If a woman vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself
by a bond, being in her father’s house in her youth, and her father hear
her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father
shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every
vow wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.”

“And was it not even so with us?” interrrupted Ravenswood.

“Control thy impatience, young man,” answered the divine, “and hear what
follows in the sacred text: ‘But if her father disallow her in the day
that he heareth, not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath
bound her soul, shall stand; and the Lord shall forgive her, because her
father disallowed her.”

“And was not,” said Lady Ashton, fiercely and triumphantly breaking
in--“was not ours the case stated in the Holy Writ? Will this person
deny, that the instant her parents heard of the vow, or bond, by which
our daughter had bound her soul, we disallowed the same in the most
express terms, and informed him by writing of our determination?”

“And is this all?” said Ravenswood, looking at Lucy. “Are you willing
to barter sworn faith, the exercise of free will, and the feelings of
mutual affection to this wretched hypocritical sophistry?”

“Hear him!” said Lady Ashton, looking to the clergyman--“hear the
blasphemer!”

“May God forgive him,” said Bide-the-Bent, “and enlighten his
ignorance!”

“Hear what I have sacrificed for you,” said Ravenswood, still addressing
Lucy, “ere you sanction what has been done in your name. The honour of
an ancient family, the urgent advice of my best friends, have been in
vain used to sway my resolution; neither the arguments of reason nor
the portents of superstition have shaken my fidelity. The very dead have
arisen to warn me, and their warning has been despised. Are you prepared
to pierce my heart for its fidelity with the very weapon which my rash
confidence entrusted to your grasp?”

“Master of Ravenswood,” said Lady Ashton, “you have asked what questions
you thought fit. You see the total incapacity of my daughter to answer
you. But I will reply for her, and in a manner which you cannot dispute.
You desire to know whether Lucy Ashton, of her own free will, desires
to annul the engagement into which she has been trepanned. You have her
letter under her own hand, demanding the surrender of it; and, in yet
more full evidence of her purpose, here is the contract which she has
this morning subscribed, in presence of this reverence gentleman, with
Mr. Hayston of Bucklaw.”

Ravenswood gazed upon the deed as if petrified. “And it was without
fraud or compulsion,” said he, looking towards the clergyman, “that Miss
Ashton subscribed this parchment?”

“I couch it upon my sacred character.”

“This is indeed, madam, an undeniable piece of evidence,” said
Ravenswood, sternly; “and it will be equally unnecessary and
dishonourable to waste another word in useless remonstrance or reproach.
There, madam,” he said, laying down before Lucy the signed paper and the
broken piece of gold--“there are the evidences of your first engagement;
may you be more faithful to that which you have just formed. I will
trouble you to return the corresponding tokens of my ill-placed
confidence; I ought rather to say, of my egregious folly.”

Lucy returned the scornful glance of her lover with a gaze from which
perception seemed to have been banished; yet she seemed partly to have
understood his meaning, for she raised her hands as if to undo a blue
ribbon which she wore around her neck. She was unable to accomplish her
purpose, but Lady Ashton cut the ribbon asunder, and detached the broken
piece of gold, which Miss Ashton had till then worn concealed in her
bosom; the written counterpart of the lovers’ engagement she for
some time had had in her own possession. With a haughty courtesy, she
delivered both to Ravenswood, who was much softened when he took the
piece of gold.

“And she could wear it thus,” he said, speaking to himself--“could wear
it in her very bosom--could wear it next to her heart--even when---- But
complain avails not,” he said, dashing from his eye the tear which
had gathered in it, and resuming the stern composure of his manner. He
strode to the chimney, and threw into the fire the paper and piece of
gold, stamping upon the coals with the heel of his boot, as if to ensure
their destruction. “I will be no longer,” he then said, “an intruder
here. Your evil wishes, and your worse offices, Lady Ashton, I will
only return by hoping these will be your last machinations against your
daughter’s honour and happiness. And to you, madam,” he said, addressing
Lucy, “I have nothing farther to say, except to pray to God that you
may not become a world’s wonder for this act of wilful and deliberate
perjury.” Having uttered these words, he turned on his heel and left the
apartment.

Sir William Ashton, by entreaty and authority, had detained his son and
Bucklaw in a distant part of the castle, in order to prevent their
again meeting with Ravenswood; but as the Master descended the great
staircase, Lockhard delivered him a billet, signed “Sholto Douglas
Ashton,” requesting to know where the Master of Ravenswood would be
heard of four or five days from hence, as the writer had business of
weight to settle with him, so soon as an important family event had
taken place.

“Tell Colonel Ashton,” said Ravenswood, composedly, “I shall be found at
Wolf’s Crag when his leisure serves him.”

As he descended the outward stair which led from the terrace, he was
a second time interrupted by Craigengelt, who, on the part of his
principal, the Laird of Bucklaw, expressed a hope that Ravenswood would
not leave Scotland within ten days at least, as he had both former and
recent civilities for which to express his gratitude.

“Tell your master,” said Ravenswood, fiercely, “to choose his own time.
He will find me at Wolf’s Crag, if his purpose is not forestalled.”

“MY master!” replied Craigengelt, encouraged by seeing Colonel Ashton
and Bucklaw at the bottom of the terrace. “Give me leave to say I know
of no such person upon earth, nor will I permit such language to be used
to me!”

“Seek your master, then, in hell!” exclaimed Ravenswood, giving way to
the passion he had hitherto restrained, and throwing Craigengelt from
him with such violence that he rolled down the steps and lay senseless
at the foot of them. “I am a fool,” he instantly added, “to vent my
passion upon a caitiff so worthless.”

He then mounted his horse, which at his arrival he had secured to a
balustrade in front of the castle, rode very slowly past Bucklaw and
Colonel Ashton, raising his hat as he passed each, and looking in their
faces steadily while he offered this mute salutation, which was returned
by both with the same stern gravity. Ravenswood walked on with equal
deliberation until he reached the head of the avenue, as if to show
that he rather courted than avoided interruption. When he had passed the
upper gate, he turned his horse, and looked at the castle with a fixed
eye; then set spurs to his good steed, and departed with the speed of a
demon dismissed by the exorcist.




CHAPTER XXXIV.

     Who comes from the bridal chamber?
     It is Azrael, the angel of death.

     Thalaba.

AFTER the dreadful scene that had taken place at the castle, Lucy was
transported to her own chamber, where she remained for some time in a
state of absolute stupor. Yet afterwards, in the course of the
ensuing day, she seemed to have recovered, not merely her spirits
and resolution, but a sort of flighty levity, that was foreign to her
character and situation, and which was at times chequered by fits of
deep silence and melancholy and of capricious pettishness. Lady Ashton
became much alarmed and consulted the family physicians. But as her
pulse indicated no change, they could only say that the disease was on
the spirits, and recommended gentle exercise and amusement. Miss Ashton
never alluded to what had passed in the state-room. It seemed doubtful
even if she was conscious of it, for she was often observed to raise
her hands to her neck, as if in search of the ribbon that had been taken
from it, and mutter, in surprise and discontent, when she could not find
it, “It was the link that bound me to life.”

Notwithstanding all these remarkable symptoms, Lady Ashton was too
deeply pledged to delay her daughter’s marriage even in her present
state of health. It cost her much trouble to keep up the fair side of
appearances towards Bucklaw. She was well aware, that if he once saw any
reluctance on her daughter’s part, he would break off the treaty, to her
great personal shame and dishonour. She therefore resolved that, if Lucy
continued passive, the marriage should take place upon the day that had
been previously fixed, trusting that a change of place, of situation,
and of character would operate a more speedy and effectual cure upon
the unsettled spirits of her daughter than could be attained by the slow
measures which the medical men recommended. Sir William Ashton’s views
of family aggrandisement, and his desire to strengthen himself against
the measures of the Marquis of A----, readily induced him to acquiesce
in what he could not have perhaps resisted if willing to do so. As for
the young men, Bucklaw and Colonel Ashton, they protested that, after
what had happened, it would be most dishonourable to postpone for
a single hour the time appointed for the marriage, as it would be
generally ascribed to their being intimidated by the intrusive visit and
threats of Ravenswood.

Bucklaw would indeed have been incapable of such precipitation, had he
been aware of the state of Miss Ashton’s health, or rather of her mind.
But custom, upon these occasions, permitted only brief and sparing
intercourse between the bridegroom and the betrothed; a circumstance so
well improved by Lady Ashton, that Bucklaw neither saw nor suspected the
real state of the health and feelings of his unhappy bride.

On the eve of the bridal day, Lucy appeared to have one of her fits
of levity, and surveyed with a degree of girlish interest the various
preparations of dress, etc., etc., which the different members of the
family had prepared for the occasion.

The morning dawned bright and cheerily. The bridal guests assembled
in gallant troops from distant quarters. Not only the relations of Sir
William Ashton, and the still more dignified connexions of his lady,
together with the numerous kinsmen and allies of the bridegroom, were
present upon this joyful ceremony, gallantly mounted, arrayed, and
caparisoned, but almost every Presbyterian family of distinction within
fifty miles made a point of attendance upon an occasion which was
considered as giving a sort of triumph over the Marquis of A----, in the
person of his kinsman. Splendid refreshments awaited the guests on their
arrival, and after these were finished, the cry was “To horse.” The
bride was led forth betwixt her brother Henry and her mother. Her
gaiety of the preceding day had given rise [place] to a deep shade of
melancholy, which, however, did not misbecome an occasion so momentous.
There was a light in her eyes and a colour in her cheek which had not
been kindled for many a day, and which, joined to her great beauty, and
the splendour of her dress, occasioned her entrance to be greeted with
an universal murmur of applause, in which even the ladies could not
refrain from joining. While the cavalcade were getting to horse, Sir
William Ashton, a man of peace and of form, censured his son Henry for
having begirt himself with a military sword of preposterous length,
belonging to his brother, Colonel Ashton.

“If you must have a weapon,” he said, “upon such a peaceful occasion,
why did you not use the short poniard sent from Edinburgh on purpose?”

The boy vindicated himself by saying it was lost.

“You put it out of the way yourself, I suppose,” said his father, “out
of ambition to wear that preposterous thing, which might have served Sir
William Wallace. But never mind, get to horse now, and take care of your
sister.”

The boy did so, and was placed in the centre of the gallant train. At
the time, he was too full of his own appearance, his sword, his laced
cloak, his feathered hat, and his managed horse, to pay much regard to
anything else; but he afterwards remembered to the hour of his death,
that when the hand of his sister, by which she supported herself on
the pillion behind him, touched his own, it felt as wet and cold as
sepulchral marble.

Glancing wide over hill and dale, the fair bridal procession at last
reached the parish church, which they nearly filled; for, besides
domestics, above a hundred gentlemen and ladies were present upon the
occasion. The marriage ceremony was performed according to the rites
of the Presbyterian persuasion, to which Bucklaw of late had judged it
proper to conform.

On the outside of the church, a liberal dole was distributed to the poor
of the neighbouring parishes, under the direction of Johnie Mortheuch
[Mortsheugh], who had lately been promoted from his desolate quarters
at the Hermitage to fill the more eligible situation of sexton at
the parish church of Ravenswood. Dame Gourlay, with two of her
contemporaries, the same who assisted at Alice’s late-wake, seated apart
upon a flat monument, or “through-stane,” sate enviously comparing the
shares which had been allotted to them in dividing the dole.

“Johnie Mortheuch,” said Annie Winnie, “might hae minded auld lang syne,
and thought of his auld kimmers, for as braw as he is with his new black
coat. I hae gotten but five herring instead o’ sax, and this disna look
like a gude saxpennys, and I dare say this bit morsel o’ beef is an unce
lighter than ony that’s been dealt round; and it’s a bit o’ the tenony
hough, mair by token that yours, Maggie, is out o’ the back-sey.”

“Mine, quo’ she!” mumbled the paralytic hag--“mine is half banes,
I trow. If grit folk gie poor bodies ony thing for coming to their
weddings and burials, it suld be something that wad do them gude, I
think.”

“Their gifts,” said Ailsie Gourlay, “are dealt for nae love of us, nor
out of respect for whether we feed or starve. They wad gie us whinstanes
for loaves, if it would serve their ain vanity, and yet they expect us
to be as gratefu’, as they ca’ it, as if they served us for true love
and liking.”

“And that’s truly said,” answered her companion.

“But, Aislie Gourlay, ye’re the auldest o’ us three--did ye ever see a
mair grand bridal?”

“I winna say that I have,” answered the hag; “but I think soon to see as
braw a burial.”

“And that wad please me as weel,” said Annie Winnie; “for there’s
as large a dole, and folk are no obliged to girn and laugh, and mak
murgeons, and wish joy to these hellicat quality, that lord it ower us
like brute beasts. I like to pack the dead-dole in my lap and rin ower
my auld rhyme--

     My loaf in my lap, my penny in my purse,
     Thou art ne’er the better, and
     I’m ne’er the worse.”

“That’s right, Annie,” said the paralytic woman; “God send us a green
Yule and a fat kirkyard!”

“But I wad like to ken, Luckie Gourlay, for ye’re the auldest and wisest
amang us, whilk o’ these revellers’ turn it will be to be streikit
first?”

“D’ye see yon dandilly maiden,” said Dame Gourlay, “a’ glistenin’ wi’
gowd and jewels, that they are lifting up on the white horse behind that
hare-brained callant in scarlet, wi’ the lang sword at his side?”

“But that’s the bride!” said her companion, her cold heart touched with
some sort of compassion--“that’s the very bride hersell! Eh, whow! sae
young, sae braw, and sae bonny--and is her time sae short?”

“I tell ye,” said the sibyl, “her winding sheet is up as high as her
throat already, believe it wha list. Her sand has but few grains to rin
out; and nae wonder--they’ve been weel shaken. The leaves are withering
fast on the trees, but she’ll never see the Martinmas wind gar them
dance in swirls like the fairy rings.” “Ye waited on her for a
quarter,” said the paralytic woman, “and got twa red pieces, or I am far
beguiled?”

“Ay, ay,” answered Ailsie, with a bitter grin; “and Sir William Ashton
promised me a bonny red gown to the boot o’ that--a stake, and a chain,
and a tar-barrel, lass! what think ye o’ that for a propine?--for being
up early and doun late for fourscore nights and mair wi’ his dwining
daughter. But he may keep it for his ain leddy, cummers.”

“I hae heard a sough,” said Annie Winnie, “as if Leddy Ashton was nae
canny body.”

“D’ye see her yonder,” said Dame Gourlay, “as she prances on her grey
gelding out at the kirkyard? There’s mair o’ utter deevilry in that
woman, as brave and fair-fashioned as she rides yonder, than in a’ the
Scotch withces that ever flew by moonlight ower North Berwick Law.”

“What’s that ye say about witches, ye damned hags?” said Johnie
Mortheuch [Mortsheugh]; “are ye casting yer cantrips in the very
kirkyard, to mischieve the bride and bridegroom? Get awa’ hame, for if I
tak my souple t’ye, I’ll gar ye find the road faster than ye wad like.”

“Hegh, sirs!” answered Ailsie Gourlay; “how bra’ are we wi’ our new
black coat and our weel-pouthered head, as if we had never kenn’d hunger
nor thirst oursells! and we’ll be screwing up our bit fiddle, doubtless,
in the ha’ the night, amang a’ the other elbo’-jiggers for miles round.
Let’s see if the pins haud, Johnie--that’s a’, lad.”

“I take ye a’ to witness, gude people,” said Morheuch, “that she
threatens me wi’ mischief, and forespeaks me. If ony thing but gude
happens to me or my fiddle this night, I’ll make it the blackest night’s
job she ever stirred in. I’ll hae her before presbytery and synod: I’m
half a minister mysell, now that I’m a bedral in an inhabited parish.”

Although the mutual hatred betwixt these hags and the rest of mankind
had steeled their hearts against all impressions of festivity, this was
by no means the case with the multitude at large. The splendour of the
bridal retinue, the gay dresses, the spirited horses, the blythesome
appearance of the handsome women and gallant gentlemen assembled upon
the occasion, had the usual effect upon the minds of the populace.
The repeated shouts of “Ashton and Bucklaw for ever!” the discharge of
pistols, guns, and musketoons, to give what was called the bridal shot,
evinced the interest the people took in the occasion of the cavalcade,
as they accompanied it upon their return to the castle. If there was
here and there an elder peasant or his wife who sneered at the pomp
of the upstart family, and remembered the days of the long-descended
Ravenswoods, even they, attracted by the plentiful cheer which the
castle that day afforded to rich and poor, held their way thither,
and acknowledged, notwithstanding their prejudices, the influence of
l’Amphitrion ou l’on dine.

Thus accompanied with the attendance both of rich and poor, Lucy
returned to her father’s house. Bucklaw used his privilege of riding
next to the bride, but, new to such a situation, rather endeavoured to
attract attention by the display of his person and horsemanship, than
by any attempt to address her in private. They reached the castle in
safety, amid a thousand joyous acclamations.

It is well known that the weddings of ancient days were celebrated
with a festive publicity rejected by the delicacy of modern times. The
marriage guests, on the present occasion, were regaled with a banquet
of unbounded profusion, the relics of which, after the domestics had
feasted in their turn, were distributed among the shouting crowd, with
as many barrels of ale as made the hilarity without correspond to that
within the castle. The gentlemen, according to the fashion of the times,
indulged, for the most part, in deep draughts of the richest wines,
while the ladies, prepared for the ball which always closed a bridal
entertainment, impatiently expected their arrival in the state gallery.
At length the social party broke up at a late hour, and the gentlemen
crowded into the saloon, where, enlivened by wine and the joyful
occasion, they laid aside their swords and handed their impatient
partners to the floor. The music already rung from the gallery, along
the fretted roof of the ancient state apartment. According to strict
etiquette, the bride ought to have opened the ball; but Lady Ashton,
making an apology on account of her daughter’s health, offered her own
hand to Bucklaw as substitute for her daughter’s. But as Lady Ashton
raised her head gracefully, expecting the strain at which she was to
begin the dance, she was so much struck by an unexpected alteration
in the ornaments of the apartment that she was surprised into an
exclamation, “Who has dared to change the pictures?”

All looked up, and those who knew the usual state of the apartment
observed, with surprise, that the picture of Sir William Ashton’s father
was removed from its place, and in its stead that of old Sir Malise
Ravenswood seemed to frown wrath and vengeance upon the party assembled
below. The exchange must have been made while the apartments were empty,
but had not been observed until the torches and lights in the sconces
were kindled for the ball. The haughty and heated spirits of the
gentlemen led them to demand an immediate inquiry into the cause of what
they deemed an affront to their host and to themselves; but Lady Ashton,
recovering herself, passed it over as the freak of a crazy wench who was
maintained about the castle, and whose susceptible imagination had been
observed to be much affected by the stories which Dame Gourlay delighted
to tell concerning “the former family,” so Lady Ashton named the
Ravenswoods. The obnoxious picture was immediately removed, and the ball
was opened by Lady Ashton, with a grace and dignity which supplied the
charms of youth, and almost verified the extravagant encomiums of the
elder part of the company, who extolled her performance as far exceeding
the dancing of the rising generation.

When Lady Ashton sat down, she was not surprised to find that her
daughter had left the apartment, and she herself followed, eager to
obviate any impression which might have been made upon her nerves by an
incident so likely to affect them as the mysterious transposition of the
portraits. Apparently she found her apprehensions groundless, for she
returned in about an hour, and whispered the bridegroom, who extricated
himself from the dancers, and vanished from the apartment. The
instruments now played their loudest strains; the dancers pursued their
exercise with all the enthusiasm inspired by youth, mirth, and high
spirits, when a cry was heard so shrill and piercing as at once to
arrest the dance and the music. All stood motionless; but when the yell
was again repeated, Colonel Ashton snatched a torch from the sconce,
and demanding the key of the bridal-chamber from Henry, to whom, as
bride’s-man, it had been entrusted, rushed thither, followed by Sir
William Ashton and Lady Ashton, and one or two others, near relations
of the family. The bridal guests waited their return in stupified
amazement.

Arrived at the door of the apartment, Colonel Ashton knocked and called,
but received no answer except stifled groans. He hesitated no longer
to open the door of the apartment, in which he found opposition from
something which lay against it. When he had succeeded in opening it, the
body of the bridegroom was found lying on the threshold of the bridal
chamber, and all around was flooded with blood. A cry of surprise and
horror was raised by all present; and the company, excited by this
new alarm, began to rush tumultuously towards the sleeping apartment.
Colonel Ashton, first whispering to his mother, “Search for her; she
has murdered him!” drew his sword, planted himself in the passage, and
declared he would suffer no man to pass excepting the clergyman and
a medical person present. By their assistance, Bucklaw, who still
breathed, was raised from the ground, and transported to another
apartment, where his friends, full of suspicion and murmuring, assembled
round him to learn the opinion of the surgeon.

In the mean while, Lady Ashton, her husband, and their assistants in
vain sought Lucy in the bridal bed and in the chamber. There was no
private passage from the room, and they began to think that she must
have thrown herself from the window, when one of the company, holding
his torch lower than the rest, discovered something white in the corner
of the great old-fashioned chimney of the apartment. Here they found
the unfortunate girl seated, or rather couched like a hare upon its
form--her head-gear dishevelled, her night-clothes torn and dabbled with
blood, her eyes glazed, and her features convulsed into a wild paroxysm
of insanity. When she saw herself discovered, she gibbered, made mouths,
and pointed at them with her bloody fingers, with the frantic gestures
of an exulting demoniac.

Female assistance was now hastily summoned; the unhappy bride was
overpowered, not without the use of some force. As they carried her over
the threshold, she looked down, and uttered the only articulate words
that she had yet spoken, saying, with a sort of grinning exultation,
“So, you have ta’en up your bonny bridegroom?” She was, by the
shuddering assistants, conveyed to another and more retired apartment,
where she was secured as her situation required, and closely watched.
The unutterable agony of the parents, the horror and confusion of all
who were in the castle, the fury of contending passions between the
friends of the different parties--passions augmented by previous
intemperance--surpass description.

The surgeon was the first who obtained something like a patient hearing;
he pronounced that the wound of Bucklaw, though severe and dangerous,
was by no means fatal, but might readily be rendered so by disturbance
and hasty removal. This silenced the numerous party of Bucklaw’s
friends, who had previously insisted that he should, at all rates, be
transported from the castle to the nearest of their houses. They still
demanded, however, that, in consideration of what had happened, four of
their number should remain to watch over the sick-bed of their friend,
and that a suitable number of their domestics, well armed, should also
remain in the castle. This condition being acceded to on the part of
Colonel Ashton and his father, the rest of the bridegroom’s friends left
the castle, notwithstanding the hour and the darkness of the night. The
cares of the medical man were next employed in behalf of Miss Ashton,
whom he pronounced to be in a very dangerous state. Farther medical
assistance was immediately summoned. All night she remained delirious.
On the morning, she fell into a state of absolute insensibility. The
next evening, the physicians said, would be the crisis of her malady. It
proved so; for although she awoke from her trance with some appearance
of calmness, and suffered her night-clothes to be changed, or put in
order, yet so soon as she put her hand to her neck, as if to search for
the for the fatal flue ribbon, a tide of recollections seemed to rush
upon her, which her mind and body were alike incapable of bearing.
Convulsion followed convulsion, till they closed in death, without her
being able to utter a word explanatory of the fatal scene.

The provincial judge of the district arrived the day after the young
lady had expired, and executed, though with all possible delicacy to
the afflicted family, the painful duty of inquiring into this fatal
transaction. But there occurred nothing to explain the general
hypothesis that the bride, in a sudden fit of insanity, had stabbed the
bridegroom at the threshold of the apartment. The fatal weapon was found
in the chamber smeared with blood. It was the same poniard which Henry
should have worn on the wedding-day, and the unhappy sister had probably
contrived to secrete on the preceding evening, when it had been shown to
her among other articles of preparation for the wedding.

The friends of Bucklaw expected that on his recovery he would throw
some light upon this dark story, and eagerly pressed him with inquiries,
which for some time he evaded under pretext of weakness. When, however,
he had been transported to his own house, and was considered in a state
of convalescence, he assembled those persons, both male and female, who
had considered themselves as entitled to press him on this subject, and
returned them thanks for the interest they had exhibited in his behalf,
and their offers of adherence and support. “I wish you all,” he said,
“my friends, to understand, however, that I have neither story to tell
nor injuries to avenge. If a lady shall question me henceforward upon
the incident of that unhappy night, I shall remain silent, and in future
consider her as one who has shown herself desirous to break of her
friendship with me; in a word, I will never speak to her again. But if a
gentleman shall ask me the same question, I shall regard the incivility
as equivalent to an invitation to meet him in the Duke’s Walk, and I
expect that he will rule himself accordingly.”

A declaration so decisive admitted no commentary; and it was soon after
seen that Bucklaw had arisen from the bed of sickness a sadder and a
wiser man than he had hitherto shown himself. He dismissed Craigengelt
from his society, but not without such a provision as, if well employed,
might secure him against indigence and against temptation. Bucklaw
afterwards went abroad, and never returned to Scotland; nor was he known
ever to hint at the circumstances attending his fatal marriage. By many
readers this may be deemed overstrained, romantic, and composed by
the wild imagination of an author desirous of gratifying the popular
appetite for the horrible; but those who are read in the private family
history of Scotland during the period in which the scene is laid, will
readily discover, through the disguise of borrowed names and added
incidents, the leading particulars of AN OWER TRUE TALE.




CHAPTER XXXV.

     Whose mind’s so marbled, and his heart so hard,
     That would not, when this huge mishap was heard,
     To th’ utmost note of sorrow set their song,
     To see a gallant, with so great a grace,
     So suddenly unthought on, so o’erthrown,
     And so to perish, in so poor a place,
     By too rash riding in a ground unknown!

     POEM, IN NISBET’S Heraldry, vol. ii.

WE have anticipated the course of time to mention Bucklaw’s recovery and
fate, that we might not interrupt the detail of events which succeeded
the funeral of the unfortunate Lucy Ashton. This melancholy ceremony was
performed in the misty dawn of an autumnal morning, with such moderate
attendance and ceremony as could not possibly be dispensed with. A very
few of the nearest relations attended her body to the same churchyard to
which she had so lately been led as a bride, with as little free will,
perhaps, as could be now testified by her lifeless and passive remains.
An aisle adjacent to the church had been fitted up by Sir William Ashton
as a family cemetery; and here, in a coffin bearing neither name nor
date, were consigned to dust the remains of what was once lovely,
beautiful, and innocent, though exasperated to frenzy by a long tract of
unremitting persecution.

While the mourners were busy in the vault, the three village hags, who,
notwithstanding the unwonted earliness of the hour, had snuffed the
carrion like vultures, were seated on the “through-stane,” and engaged
in their wonted unhallowed conference.

“Did not I say,” said Dame Gourlay, “that the braw bridal would be
followed by as braw a funeral?”

“I think,” answered Dame Winnie, “there’s little bravery at it: neither
meat nor drink, and just a wheen silver tippences to the poor folk; it
was little worth while to come sae far a road for sae sma’ profit, and
us sae frail.”

“Out, wretch!” replied Dame Gourlay, “can a’ the dainties they could gie
us be half sae sweet as this hour’s vengeance? There they are that
were capering on their prancing nags four days since, and they are now
ganging as dreigh and sober as oursells the day. They were a’ glistening
wi’ gowd and silver; they’re now as black as the crook. And Miss Lucy
Ashton, that grudged when an honest woman came near her--a taid may sit
on her coffin that day, and she can never scunner when he croaks. And
Lady Ashton has hell-fire burning in her breast by this time; and Sir
William, wi’ his gibbets, and his faggots, and his chains, how likes he
the witcheries of his ain dwelling-house?”

“And is it true, then,” mumbled the paralytic wretch, “that the bride
was trailed out of her bed and up the chimly by evil spirits, and that
the bridegroom’s face was wrung round ahint him?”

“Ye needna care wha did it, or how it was done,” said Aislie Gourlay;
“but I’ll uphaud it for nae stickit job, and that the lairds and leddies
ken weel this day.”

“And was it true,” said Annie Winnie, “sin ye ken sae muckle about it,
that the picture of auld Sir Malise Ravenswood came down on the ha’
floor, and led out the brawl before them a’?”

“Na,” said Ailsie; “but into the ha’ came the picture--and I ken weel
how it came there--to gie them a warning that pride wad get a fa’. But
there’s as queer a ploy, cummers, as ony o’ thae, that’s gaun on even
now in the burial vault yonder: ye saw twall mourners, wi’ crape and
cloak, gang down the steps pair and pair!”

“What should ail us to see them?” said the one old woman.

“I counted them,” said the other, with the eagerness of a person to
whom the spectacle had afforded too much interest to be viewed with
indifference.

“But ye did not see,” said Ailsie, exulting in her superior observation,
“that there’s a thirteenth amang them that they ken naething about; and,
if auld freits say true, there’s ane o’ that company that’ll no be lang
for this warld. But come awa’ cummers; if we bide here, I’se warrant we
get the wyte o’ whatever ill comes of it, and that gude will come of it
nane o’ them need ever think to see.”

And thus, croaking like the ravens when they anticipate pestilence, the
ill-boding sibyls withdrew from the churchyard.

In fact, the mourners, when the service of interment was ended,
discovered that there was among them one more than the invited number,
and the remark was communicated in whispers to each other. The suspicion
fell upon a figure which, muffled in the same deep mourning with the
others, was reclined, almost in a state of insensibility, against one of
the pillars of the sepulchral vault. The relatives of the Ashton family
were expressing in whispers their surprise and displeasure at the
intrusion, when they were interrupted by Colonel Ashton, who, in his
father’s absence, acted as principal mourner. “I know,” he said in a
whisper, “who this person is, he has, or shall soon have, as deep cause
of mourning as ourselves; leave me to deal with him, and do not disturb
the ceremony by unnecessary exposure.” So saying, he separated himself
from the group of his relations, and taking the unknown mourner by the
cloak, he said to him, in a tone of suppressed emotion, “Follow me.”

The stranger, as if starting from a trance at the sound of his voice,
mechanically obeyed, and they ascended the broken ruinous stair which
led from the sepulchre into the churchyard. The other mourners followed,
but remained grouped together at the door of the vault, watching with
anxiety the motions of Colonel Ashton and the stranger, who now appeared
to be in close conference beneath the shade of a yew-tree, in the most
remote part of the burial-ground.

To this sequestered spot Colonel Ashton had guided the stranger, and
then turning round, addressed him in a stern and composed tone.--“I
cannot doubt that I speak to the Master of Ravenswood?” No answer was
returned. “I cannot doubt,” resumed the Colonel, trembling with rising
passion, “that I speak to the murderer of my sister!”

“You have named me but too truly,” said Ravenswood, in a hollow and
tremulous voice.

“If you repent what you have done,” said the Colonel, “may your
penitence avail you before God; with me it shall serve you nothing.
Here,” he said, giving a paper, “is the measure of my sword, and a
memorandum of the time and place of meeting. Sunrise to-morrow morning,
on the links to the east of Wolf’s Hope.”

The Master of Ravenswood held the paper in his hand, and seemed
irresolute. At length he spoke--“Do not,” he said, “urge to farther
desperation a wretch who is already desperate. Enjoy your life while you
can, and let me seek my death from another.”

“That you never, never shall!” said Douglas Ashton. “You shall die by my
hand, or you shall complete the ruin of my family by taking my life. If
you refuse my open challenge, there is no advantage I will not take of
you, no indignity with which I will not load you, until the very name of
Ravenswood shall be the sign of everything that is dishonourable, as it
is already of all that is villainous.”

“That it shall never be,” said Ravenswood, fiercely; “if I am the last
who must bear it, I owe it to those who once owned it that the name
shall be extinguished without infamy. I accept your challenge, time, and
place of meeting. We meet, I presume, alone?”

“Alone we meet,” said Colonel Ashton, “and alone will the survivor of us
return from that place of rendezvous.”

“Then God have mercy on the soul of him who falls!” said Ravenswood.

“So be it!” said Colonel Ashton; “so far can my charity reach even for
the man I hate most deadly, and with the deepest reason. Now, break off,
for we shall be interrupted. The links by the sea-shore to the east of
Wolf’s Hope; the hour, sunrise; our swords our only weapons.”

“Enough,” said the Master, “I will not fail you.”

They separated; Colonel Ashton joining the rest of the mourners, and the
Master of Ravenswood taking his horse, which was tied to a tree behind
the church. Colonel Ashton returned to the castle with the funeral
guests, but found a pretext for detaching himself from them in the
evening, when, changing his dress to a riding-habit, he rode to Wolf’s
Hope, that night, and took up his abode in the little inn, in order that
he might be ready for his rendezvous in the morning.

It is not known how the Master of Ravenswood disposed of the rest of
that unhappy day. Late at night, however, he arrived at Wolf’s Crag, and
aroused his old domestic, Caleb Balderstone, who had ceased to expect
his return. Confused and flying rumours of the late tragical death of
Miss Ashton, and of its mysterious cause, had already reached the old
man, who was filled with the utmost anxiety, on account of the probable
effect these events might produce upon the mind of his master.

The conduct of Ravenswood did not alleviate his apprehensions. To the
butler’s trembling entreaties that he would take some refreshment, he at
first returned no answer, and then suddenly and fiercely demanding wine,
he drank, contrary to his habits, a very large draught. Seeing that his
master would eat nothing, the old man affectionately entreated that
he would permit him to light him to his chamber. It was not until the
request was three or four times repeated that Ravenswood made a mute
sign of compliance. But when Balderstone conducted him to an apartment
which had been comfortably fitted up, and which, since his return, he
had usually occupied, Ravenswood stopped short on the threshold.

“Not here,” said he, sternly; “show me the room in which my father died;
the room in which SHE slept the night the were at the castle.”

“Who, sir?” said Caleb, too terrified to preserve his presence of mind.

“SHE, Lucy Ashton! Would you kill me, old man, by forcing me to repeat
her name?”

Caleb would have said something of the disrepair of the chamber, but was
silenced by the irritable impatience which was expressed in his master’s
countenance; he lighted the way trembling and in silence, placed the
lamp on the table of the deserted room, and was about to attempt some
arrangement of the bed, when his master bid him begone in a tone that
admitted of no delay. The old man retired, not to rest, but to prayer;
and from time to time crept to the door of the apartment, in order to
find out whether Ravenswood had gone to repose. His measured heavy step
upon the floor was only interrupted by deep groans; and the repeated
stamps of the heel of his heavy boot intimated too clearly that the
wretched inmate was abandoning himself at such moments to paroxysms of
uncontrolled agony. The old man thought that the morning, for which he
longed, would never have dawned; but time, whose course rolls on with
equal current, however it may seem more rapid or more slow to mortal
apprehension, brought the dawn at last, and spread a ruddy light on the
broad verge of the glistening ocean. It was early in November, and the
weather was serene for the season of the year. But an easterly wind had
prevailed during the night, and the advancing tide rolled nearer than
usual to the foot of the crags on which the castle was founded.

With the first peep of light, Caleb Balderstone again resorted to the
door of Ravenswood’s sleeping apartment, through a chink of which he
observed him engaged in measuring the length of two or three swords
which lay in a closet adjoining to the apartment. He muttered to
himself, as he selected one of these weapons: “It is shorter: let him
have this advantage, as he has every other.”

Caleb Balderstone knew too well, from what he witnessed, upon what
enterprise his master was bound, and how vain all interference on his
part must necessarily prove. He had but time to retreat from the
door, so nearly was he surprised by his master suddenly coming out and
descending to the stables. The faithful domestic followed; and from the
dishevelled appearance of his master’s dress, and his ghastly looks, was
confirmed in his conjecture that he had passed the night without sleep
or repose. He found him busily engaged in saddling his horse, a service
from which Caleb, though with faltering voice and trembling hands,
offered to relieve him. Ravenswood rejected his assistance by a mute
sign, and having led the animal into the court, was just about to mount
him, when the old domestic’s fear giving way to the strong attachment
which was the principal passion of his mind, he flung himself suddenly
at Ravenswood’s feet, and clasped his knees, while he exclaimed: “Oh,
sir! oh, master! kill me if you will, but do not go out on this dreadful
errand! Oh! my dear master, wait but this day; the Marquis of A----
comes to-morrow, and a’ will be remedied.”

“You have no longer a master, Caleb,” said Ravenswood, endeavouring to
extricate himself; “why, old man, would you cling to a falling tower?”

“But I HAVE a master,” cried Caleb, still holding him fast, “while the
heir of Ravenswood breathes. I am but a servant; but I was born your
father’s--your grandfather’s servant. I was born for the family--I have
lived for them--I would die for them! Stay but at home, and all will be
well!”

“Well, fool! well!” said Ravenswood. “Vain old man, nothing hereafter in
life will be well with me, and happiest is the hour that shall soonest
close it!”

So saying, he extricated himself from the old man’s hold, threw himself
on his horse, and rode out the gate; but instantly turning back, he
threw towards Caleb, who hastened to meet him, a heavy purse of gold.

“Caleb!” he said, with a ghastly smile, “I make you my executor”; and
again turning his bridle, he resumed his course down the hill.

The gold fell unheeded on the pavement, for the old man ran to observe
the course which was taken by his master, who turned to the left down a
small and broken path, which gained the sea-shore through a cleft in the
rock, and led to a sort of cove where, in former times, the boats of
the castle were wont to be moored. Observing him take this course, Caleb
hastened to the eastern battlement, which commanded the prospect of the
whole sands, very near as far as the village of Wolf’s Hope. He could
easily see his master riding in that direction, as fast as the horse
could carry him. The prophecy at once rushed on Balderstone’s mind, that
the Lord of Ravenswood should perish on the Kelpie’s flow, which
lay half-way betwixt the Tower and the links, or sand knolls, to the
northward of Wolf’s Hope. He saw him according reach the fatal spot; but
he never saw him pass further.


Colonel Ashton, frantic for revenge, was already in the field, pacing
the turf with eagerness, and looking with impatience towards the Tower
for the arrival of his antagonist. The sun had now risen, and showed its
broad disk above the eastern sea, so that he could easily discern the
horseman who rode towards him with speed which argued impatience equal
to his own. At once the figure became invisible, as if it had melted
into the air. He rubbed his eyes, as if he had witnessed an apparition,
and then hastened to the spot, near which he was met by Balderstone,
who came from the opposite direction. No trace whatever of horse or rider
could be discerned; it only appeared that the late winds and high tides
had greatly extended the usual bounds of the quicksand, and that
the unfortunate horseman, as appeared from the hoof-tracks, in his
precipitate haste, had not attended to keep on the firm sands on the
foot of the rock, but had taken the shortest and most dangerous course.
One only vestige of his fate appeared. A large sable feather had been
detached from his hat, and the rippling waves of the rising tide wafted
it to Caleb’s feet. The old man took it up, dried it, and placed it in
his bosom.

The inhabitants of Wolf’s Hope were now alarmed, and crowded to the
place, some on shore, and some in boats, but their search availed
nothing. The tenacious depths of the quicksand, as is usual in such
cases, retained its prey.


Our tale draws to a conclusion. The Marquis of A----, alarmed at the
frightful reports that were current, and anxious for his kinsman’s
safety, arrived on the subsequent day to mourn his loss; and, after
renewing in vain a search for the body, returned, to forget what had
happened amid the bustle of politics and state affairs.

Not so Caleb Balderstone. If wordly profit could have consoled the old
man, his age was better provided for than his earlier years had ever
been; but life had lost to him its salt and its savour. His whole course
of ideas, his feelings, whether of pride or of apprehension, of pleasure
or of pain, had all arisen from its close connexion with the family
which was now extinguished. He held up his head no longer, forsook all
his usual haunts and occupations, and seemed only to find pleasure in
moping about those apartments in the old castle which the Master of
Ravenswood had last inhabited. He ate without refreshment, and slumbered
without repose; and, with a fidelity sometimes displayed by the canine
race, but seldom by human beings, he pined and died within a year after
the catastrophe which we have narrated.


The family of Ashton did not long survive that of Ravenswood. Sir
William Ashton outlived his eldest son, the Colonel, who was slain in a
duel in Flanders; and Henry, by whom he was succeeded, died unmarried.
Lady Ashton lived to the verge of extreme old age, the only survivor
of the group of unhappy persons whose misfortunes were owing to her
implacability. That she might internally feel compunction, and reconcile
herself with Heaven, whom she had offended, we will not, and we dare
not, deny; but to those around her she did not evince the slightest
symptom either of repentance or remorse. In all external appearance she
bore the same bold, haughty, unbending character which she had displayed
before these unhappy events. A splendid marble monument records her
name, titles, and virtues, while her victims remain undistinguished by
tomb or epitath.


CHAPTER I


     Thus communed these; while to their lowly dome,
     The full-fed swine returnâ€™d with evening home;
     Compellâ€™d, reluctant, to the several sties,
     With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.
     Popeâ€™s Odyssey


In that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the
river Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering
the greater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between
Sheffield and the pleasant town of Doncaster. The remains of this
extensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of
Warncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the fabulous
Dragon of Wantley; here were fought many of the most desperate battles
during the Civil Wars of the Roses; and here also flourished in ancient
times those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been rendered so
popular in English song.

Such being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period
towards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his
long captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his
despairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjected to every species
of subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become exorbitant
during the reign of Stephen, and whom the prudence of Henry the Second
had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the crown, had now
resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent; despising the feeble
interference of the English Council of State, fortifying their castles,
increasing the number of their dependants, reducing all around them to a
state of vassalage, and striving by every means in their power, to place
themselves each at the head of such forces as might enable him to make a
figure in the national convulsions which appeared to be impending.

The situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were called,
who, by the law and spirit of the English constitution, were entitled
to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now unusually
precarious. If, as was most generally the case, they placed themselves
under the protection of any of the petty kings in their vicinity,
accepted of feudal offices in his household, or bound themselves by
mutual treaties of alliance and protection, to support him in his
enterprises, they might indeed purchase temporary repose; but it must
be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so dear to every
English bosom, and at the certain hazard of being involved as a party in
whatever rash expedition the ambition of their protector might lead him
to undertake. On the other hand, such and so multiplied were the means
of vexation and oppression possessed by the great Barons, that they
never wanted the pretext, and seldom the will, to harass and pursue,
even to the very edge of destruction, any of their less powerful
neighbours, who attempted to separate themselves from their authority,
and to trust for their protection, during the dangers of the times, to
their own inoffensive conduct, and to the laws of the land.

A circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the
nobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from
the consequences of the Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four
generations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the Normans
and Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests,
two hostile races, one of which still felt the elation of triumph, while
the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power had
been completely placed in the hands of the Norman nobility, by the event
of the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories assure
us, with no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and nobles
had been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were
the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers,
even as proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal
policy had long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the
strength of a part of the population which was justly considered as
nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor. All the
monarchs of the Norman race had shown the most marked predilection for
their Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and many others equally
unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxon constitution,
had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants, to add
weight, as it were, to the feudal chains with which they were loaded. At
court, and in the castles of the great nobles, where the pomp and state
of a court was emulated, Norman-French was the only language employed;
in courts of law, the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same
tongue. In short, French was the language of honour, of chivalry, and
even of justice, while the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon
was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds, who knew no other. Still,
however, the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil,
and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated,
occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded betwixt
the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render themselves
mutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity arose by
degrees the structure of our present English language, in which the
speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended
together; and which has since been so richly improved by importations
from the classical languages, and from those spoken by the southern
nations of Europe.

This state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the
information of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that,
although no great historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark
the existence of the Anglo-Saxons as a separate people subsequent to the
reign of William the Second; yet the great national distinctions betwixt
them and their conquerors, the recollection of what they had formerly
been, and to what they were now reduced, continued down to the reign
of Edward the Third, to keep open the wounds which the Conquest had
inflicted, and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the descendants
of the victor Normans and the vanquished Saxons.

The sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest,
which we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. Hundreds of
broad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed
perhaps the stately march of the Roman soldiery, flung their gnarled
arms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward; in some
places they were intermingled with beeches, hollies, and copsewood of
various descriptions, so closely as totally to intercept the level beams
of the sinking sun; in others they receded from each other, forming
those long sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the eye delights
to lose itself, while imagination considers them as the paths to yet
wilder scenes of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun shot a
broken and discoloured light, that partially hung upon the shattered
boughs and mossy trunks of the trees, and there they illuminated in
brilliant patches the portions of turf to which they made their way. A
considerable open space, in the midst of this glade, seemed formerly to
have been dedicated to the rites of Druidical superstition; for, on
the summit of a hillock, so regular as to seem artificial, there still
remained part of a circle of rough unhewn stones, of large dimensions.
Seven stood upright; the rest had been dislodged from their places,
probably by the zeal of some convert to Christianity, and lay, some
prostrate near their former site, and others on the side of the hill.
One large stone only had found its way to the bottom, and in stopping
the course of a small brook, which glided smoothly round the foot of
the eminence, gave, by its opposition, a feeble voice of murmur to the
placid and elsewhere silent streamlet.

The human figures which completed this landscape, were in number two,
partaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild and rustic
character, which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of
Yorkshire at that early period. The eldest of these men had a
stern, savage, and wild aspect. His garment was of the simplest form
imaginable, being a close jacket with sleeves, composed of the tanned
skin of some animal, on which the hair had been originally left, but
which had been worn off in so many places, that it would have been
difficult to distinguish from the patches that remained, to what
creature the fur had belonged. This primeval vestment reached from
the throat to the knees, and served at once all the usual purposes
of body-clothing; there was no wider opening at the collar, than
was necessary to admit the passage of the head, from which it may be
inferred, that it was put on by slipping it over the head and shoulders,
in the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk. Sandals, bound
with thongs made of boarsâ€™ hide, protected the feet, and a roll of thin
leather was twined artificially round the legs, and, ascending above the
calf, left the knees bare, like those of a Scottish Highlander. To make
the jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was gathered at the middle
by a broad leathern belt, secured by a brass buckle; to one side of
which was attached a sort of scrip, and to the other a ramâ€™s horn,
accoutred with a mouthpiece, for the purpose of blowing. In the same
belt was stuck one of those long, broad, sharp-pointed, and two-edged
knives, with a buckâ€™s-horn handle, which were fabricated in the
neighbourhood, and bore even at this early period the name of a
Sheffield whittle. The man had no covering upon his head, which was
only defended by his own thick hair, matted and twisted together, and
scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty dark-red colour,
forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his cheeks, which was
rather of a yellow or amber hue. One part of his dress only remains, but
it is too remarkable to be suppressed; it was a brass ring, resembling a
dogâ€™s collar, but without any opening, and soldered fast round his neck,
so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing, yet so tight as to
be incapable of being removed, excepting by the use of the file. On this
singular gorget was engraved, in Saxon characters, an inscription of the
following purport:--â€œGurth, the son of Beowulph, is the born thrall of
Cedric of Rotherwood.â€

Beside the swine-herd, for such was Gurthâ€™s occupation, was seated, upon
one of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person about ten years younger
in appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companionâ€™s in
form, was of better materials, and of a more fantastic appearance. His
jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had
been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours. To
the jacket he added a short cloak, which scarcely reached half way down
his thigh; it was of crimson cloth, though a good deal soiled, lined
with bright yellow; and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the
other, or at his pleasure draw it all around him, its width, contrasted
with its want of longitude, formed a fantastic piece of drapery. He had
thin silver bracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar of the
same metal bearing the inscription, â€œWamba, the son of Witless, is the
thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.â€ This personage had the same sort of
sandals with his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong,
his legs were cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the
other yellow. He was provided also with a cap, having around it more
than one bell, about the size of those attached to hawks, which jingled
as he turned his head to one side or other; and as he seldom remained a
minute in the same posture, the sound might be considered as incessant.
Around the edge of this cap was a stiff bandeau of leather, cut at the
top into open work, resembling a coronet, while a prolonged bag arose
from within it, and fell down on one shoulder like an old-fashioned
nightcap, or a jelly-bag, or the head-gear of a modern hussar. It was to
this part of the cap that the bells were attached; which circumstance,
as well as the shape of his head-dress, and his own half-crazed,
half-cunning expression of countenance, sufficiently pointed him out as
belonging to the race of domestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the
houses of the wealthy, to help away the tedium of those lingering
hours which they were obliged to spend within doors. He bore, like
his companion, a scrip, attached to his belt, but had neither horn nor
knife, being probably considered as belonging to a class whom it is
esteemed dangerous to intrust with edge-tools. In place of these, he
was equipped with a sword of lath, resembling that with which Harlequin
operates his wonders upon the modern stage.

The outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger
contrast than their look and demeanour. That of the serf, or bondsman,
was sad and sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance
of deep dejection, which might be almost construed into apathy, had
not the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that
there slumbered, under the appearance of sullen despondency, a sense of
oppression, and a disposition to resistance. The looks of Wamba, on
the other hand, indicated, as usual with his class, a sort of vacant
curiosity, and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose, together
with the utmost self-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and the
appearance which he made. The dialogue which they maintained between
them, was carried on in Anglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was
universally spoken by the inferior classes, excepting the Norman
soldiers, and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal
nobles. But to give their conversation in the original would convey but
little information to the modern reader, for whose benefit we beg to
offer the following translation:

â€œThe curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!â€ said the
swine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together
the scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes
equally melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from the
luxurious banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened,
or to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet, where several of them,
half plunged in mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether regardless
of the voice of their keeper. â€œThe curse of St Withold upon them and
upon me!â€ said Gurth; â€œif the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them
ere nightfall, I am no true man. Here, Fangs! Fangs!â€ he ejaculated at
the top of his voice to a ragged wolfish-looking dog, a sort of lurcher,
half mastiff, half greyhound, which ran limping about as if with the
purpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters;
but which, in fact, from misapprehension of the swine-herdâ€™s signals,
ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense, only drove them hither
and thither, and increased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy.
â€œA devil draw the teeth of him,â€ said Gurth, â€œand the mother of mischief
confound the Ranger of the forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs,
and makes them unfit for their trade! [8] Wamba, up and help me an thou
beâ€™st a man; take a turn round the back oâ€™ the hill to gain the wind
on them; and when thousâ€™t got the weather-gage, thou mayst drive them
before thee as gently as so many innocent lambs.â€

â€œTruly,â€ said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, â€œI have consulted
my legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion, that
to carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of
unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore,
Gurth, I advise thee to call off Fangs, and leave the herd to their
destiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers,
or of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to
be converted into Normans before morning, to thy no small ease and
comfort.â€

â€œThe swine turned Normans to my comfort!â€ quoth Gurth; â€œexpound that
to me, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read
riddles.â€

â€œWhy, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four
legs?â€ demanded Wamba.

â€œSwine, fool, swine,â€ said the herd, â€œevery fool knows that.â€

â€œAnd swine is good Saxon,â€ said the Jester; â€œbut how call you the sow
when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,
like a traitor?â€

â€œPork,â€ answered the swine-herd.

â€œI am very glad every fool knows that too,â€ said Wamba, â€œand pork, I
think, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives, and is in
the charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a
Norman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to
feast among the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth, ha?â€

â€œIt is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy
foolâ€™s pate.â€

â€œNay, I can tell you more,â€ said Wamba, in the same tone; â€œthere is old
Alderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while he is under the
charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a fiery
French gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are
destined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau
in the like manner; he is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a
Norman name when he becomes matter of enjoyment.â€

â€œBy St Dunstan,â€ answered Gurth, â€œthou speakest but sad truths; little
is left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have been
reserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to
endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The finest and the fattest
is for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and
bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant
lands with their bones, leaving few here who have either will or the
power to protect the unfortunate Saxon. Godâ€™s blessing on our master
Cedric, he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap; but
Reginald Front-de-Boeuf is coming down to this country in person, and we
shall soon see how little Cedricâ€™s trouble will avail him.--Here, here,â€
 he exclaimed again, raising his voice, â€œSo ho! so ho! well done, Fangs!
thou hast them all before thee now, and bringâ€™st them on bravely, lad.â€

â€œGurth,â€ said the Jester, â€œI know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou
wouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. One word to
Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast
spoken treason against the Norman,--and thou art but a cast-away
swineherd,--thou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all
evil speakers against dignities.â€

â€œDog, thou wouldst not betray me,â€ said Gurth, â€œafter having led me on
to speak so much at disadvantage?â€

â€œBetray thee!â€ answered the Jester; â€œno, that were the trick of a wise
man; a fool cannot half so well help himself--but soft, whom have we
here?â€ he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which
became then audible.

â€œNever mind whom,â€ answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before him,
and, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim
vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.

â€œNay, but I must see the riders,â€ answered Wamba; â€œperhaps they are come
from Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.â€

â€œA murrain take thee,â€ rejoined the swine-herd; â€œwilt thou talk of such
things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within
a few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain,
I never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the
oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their
great boughs as if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the rational if
thou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the storm begins to
rage, for the night will be fearful.â€

Wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his
companion, who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff
which lay upon the grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily
down the forest glade, driving before him, with the assistance of Fangs,
the whole herd of his inharmonious charge.




CHAPTER II

     A Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,
     An outrider that loved venerie;
     A manly man, to be an Abbot able,
     Full many a daintie horse had he in stable:
     And whan he rode, men might his bridle hear
     Gingeling in a whistling wind as clear,
     And eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,
     There as this lord was keeper of the cell.
     --Chaucer.

Notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion,
the noise of the horsemenâ€™s feet continuing to approach, Wamba could
not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every
pretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of
half-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden
who crossed their path. The horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on
the road.

Their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost
seemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others
their attendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and
character of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic
of high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of
materials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted.
His mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample,
and not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent
person. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his
habit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have
been called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye,
that sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary.
In other respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready
command over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into
solemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured
social indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of
popes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned
up with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden
clasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and
ornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while
she retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its
simplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them,
a certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the
vanities of the world.

This worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose furniture
was highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the fashion of the
day, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he had nothing of the
awkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy and habitual grace of
a well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that so humble a conveyance
as a mule, in however good case, and however well broken to a pleasant
and accommodating amble, was only used by the gallant monk for
travelling on the road. A lay brother, one of those who followed in the
train, had, for his use on other occasions, one of the most handsome
Spanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which merchants used at that
time to import, with great trouble and risk, for the use of persons of
wealth and distinction. The saddle and housings of this superb palfrey
were covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached nearly to the ground,
and on which were richly embroidered, mitres, crosses, and other
ecclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a sumpter mule, loaded
probably with his superiorâ€™s baggage; and two monks of his own order,
of inferior station, rode together in the rear, laughing and conversing
with each other, without taking much notice of the other members of the
cavalcade.

The companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin,
strong, tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and
constant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the
human form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which
had sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more.
His head was covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur--of that kind
which the French call â€œmortierâ€, from its resemblance to the shape of an
inverted mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and its
expression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of
fear, upon strangers. High features, naturally strong and powerfully
expressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant
exposure to the tropical sun, and might, in their ordinary state, be
said to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the
projection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which the
upper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest
emotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily
awakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history
of difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge
opposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road
by a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his brow
gave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinister expression
to one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the same
occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a slight and
partial degree distorted.

The upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in
shape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet,
showed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of
monks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white
cloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at
first view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely, of
linked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited and
interwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought in
the stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of his
thighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen, were
also covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by
splints, or thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each
other; and mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually
protected the legs, and completed the riderâ€™s defensive armour. In
his girdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only
offensive weapon about his person.

He rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the
road, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully
accoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his
head, having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of the
saddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene carving;
on the other the riderâ€™s plumed head-piece and hood of mail, with a long
two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A second squire
held aloft his masterâ€™s lance, from the extremity of which fluttered a
small banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the same form with that
embroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his small triangular
shield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast, and from thence
diminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet cloth, which
prevented the device from being seen.

These two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages,
white turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to
be natives of some distant Eastern country. [9]

The whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and
outlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern
attendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of the
same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former were
naked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk and
embroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and
importance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking
contrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed
with crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and
matched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of
them bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four
feet in length, having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among
the Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial
exercise called â€œEl Jerridâ€, still practised in the Eastern countries.

The steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their
riders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian
descent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and
easy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed,
heavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in
Normandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply
of plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern
coursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of
shadow.

The singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the
curiosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile
companion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx
Abbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of
the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures
still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.

Yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the
clergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a
fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial
temper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all
ordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and
principal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of
a distinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not
disposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed
admirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the
ennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an
ancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field with
more than due eagerness, and was allowed to possess the best-trained
hawks, and the fleetest greyhounds in the North Riding; circumstances
which strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry. With the old,
he had another part to play, which, when needful, he could sustain
with great decorum. His knowledge of books, however superficial, was
sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for his supposed
learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language, with the high
tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of the church
and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an opinion of his
sanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics of the conduct of
their betters, had commiseration with the follies of Prior Aymer. He
was generous; and charity, as it is well known, covereth a multitude
of sins, in another sense than that in which it is said to do so in
Scripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a large part was at
his disposal, while they gave him the means of supplying his own very
considerable expenses, afforded also those largesses which he bestowed
among the peasantry, and with which he frequently relieved the
distresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer rode hard in the chase, or
remained long at the banquet,--if Prior Aymer was seen, at the early
peep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey, as he glided home
from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of darkness, men
only shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled themselves to his
irregularities, by recollecting that the same were practised by many
of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone for
them. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his character, were well known to
our Saxon serfs, who made their rude obeisance, and received his
â€œbenedicite, mes filz,â€ in return.

But the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants,
arrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could
scarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulxâ€™ question, when he demanded if
they knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they
surprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy
stranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants.
It is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was
conferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious, though not
probably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.

â€œI asked you, my children,â€ said the Prior, raising his voice, and using
the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and Saxon
races conversed with each other, â€œif there be in this neighbourhood any
good man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to Mother Church,
will give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a nightâ€™s
hospitality and refreshment?â€

This he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong
contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.

â€œTwo of the humblest servants of Mother Church!â€ repeated Wamba to
himself,--but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation
audible; â€œI should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and
other principal domestics!â€

After this internal commentary on the Priorâ€™s speech, he raised his
eyes, and replied to the question which had been put.

â€œIf the reverend fathers,â€ he said, â€œloved good cheer and soft lodging,
few miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where
their quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception;
or if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn
down yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of
Copmanhurst, where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the
night of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers.â€

The Prior shook his head at both proposals.

â€œMine honest friend,â€ said he, â€œif the jangling of thy bells had not
dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know â€œClericus clericum non
decimatâ€; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each otherâ€™s
hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus
an opportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed
servants.â€

â€œIt is true,â€ replied Wamba, â€œthat I, being but an ass, am,
nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverenceâ€™s
mule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church
and her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.â€

â€œA truce to thine insolence, fellow,â€ said the armed rider, breaking in
on his prattle with a high and stern voice, â€œand tell us, if thou canst,
the road to--How callâ€™d you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?â€

â€œCedric,â€ answered the Prior; â€œCedric the Saxon.--Tell me, good fellow,
are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?â€

â€œThe road will be uneasy to find,â€ answered Gurth, who broke silence for
the first time, â€œand the family of Cedric retire early to rest.â€

â€œTush, tell not me, fellow,â€ said the military rider; â€œâ€˜tis easy for
them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who
will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.â€

â€œI know not,â€ said Gurth, sullenly, â€œif I should show the way to my
masterâ€™s house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most
are fain to ask as a favour.â€

â€œDo you dispute with me, slave!â€ said the soldier; and, setting spurs
to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at
the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose
of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.

Gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,
yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the
interference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion
and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.

â€œNay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in
Palestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we
islanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth whom
she loveth.--Tell me, good fellow,â€ said he to Wamba, and seconded his
speech by a small piece of silver coin, â€œthe way to Cedric the Saxonâ€™s;
you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the wanderer
even when his character is less sanctified than ours.â€

â€œIn truth, venerable father,â€ answered the Jester, â€œthe Saracen head of
your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home--I
am not sure I shall get there to-night myself.â€

â€œTush,â€ said the Abbot, â€œthou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend
brother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens
for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights
Templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a
soldier.â€

â€œIf he is but half a monk,â€ said the Jester, â€œhe should not be wholly
unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should
be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.â€

â€œI forgive thy wit,â€ replied the Abbot, â€œon condition thou wilt show me
the way to Cedricâ€™s mansion.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ answered Wamba, â€œyour reverences must hold on this path
till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubitâ€™s length
remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are
four which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will obtain
shelter before the storm comes on.â€

The Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to
their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the
bursting of a night-storm. As their horsesâ€™ hoofs died away, Gurth
said to his companion, â€œIf they follow thy wise direction, the reverend
fathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.â€

â€œNo,â€ said the Jester, grinning, â€œbut they may reach Sheffield if they
have good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a
woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he
should chase him.â€

â€œThou art right,â€ said Gurth; â€œit were ill that Aymer saw the Lady
Rowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most
likely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let us
hear and see, and say nothing.â€

We return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind
them, and who maintained the following conversation in the Norman-French
language, usually employed by the superior classes, with the exception
of the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon descent.

â€œWhat mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?â€ said the
Templar to the Benedictine, â€œand why did you prevent me from chastising
it?â€

â€œMarry, brother Brian,â€ replied the Prior, â€œtouching the one of them, it
were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to his
folly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable race,
some of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found among the
descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme pleasure it is
to testify, by all means in their power, their aversion to their
conquerors.â€

â€œI would soon have beat him into courtesy,â€ observed Brian; â€œI am
accustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as fierce
and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months in my
household, under the management of my master of the slaves, has made
them humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will. Marry,
sir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they use either
with free will when you give them the slightest opportunity.â€

â€œAy, but,â€ answered Prior Aymer, â€œevery land has its own manners and
fashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no
information respecting the road to Cedricâ€™s house, it would have been
sure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our
way thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,
fierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even
of his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip Malvoisin, who are
no babies to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of
his race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a
renowned champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called Cedric
the Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from whom
many others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should encounter a
share of the â€˜vae victis,â€™ or severities imposed upon the vanquished.â€

â€œPrior Aymer,â€ said the Templar, â€œyou are a man of gallantry, learned
in the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters
concerning the â€˜arretsâ€™ of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this
celebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance
which I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl
as you have described her father Cedric.â€

â€œCedric is not her father,â€ replied the Prior, â€œand is but of remote
relation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to,
and is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian, however,
he is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear to him as
if she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be judge; and if
the purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft expression of a
mild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the black-tressed girls of
Palestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahoundâ€™s paradise, I am an infidel,
and no true son of the church.â€

â€œShould your boasted beauty,â€ said the Templar, â€œbe weighed in the
balance and found wanting, you know our wager?â€

â€œMy gold collar,â€ answered the Prior, â€œagainst ten butts of Chian
wine;--they are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent
vaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.â€

â€œAnd I am myself to be judge,â€ said the Templar, â€œand am only to be
convicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful
since Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?--Prior, your collar
is in danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of
Ashby-de-la-Zouche.â€

â€œWin it fairly,â€ said the Prior, â€œand wear it as ye will; I will trust
your giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman.
Yet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more
courtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives
and Eastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if
offended,--and he is noway slack in taking offence,--is a man who,
without respect to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity
of either, would clear his house of us, and send us to lodge with the
larks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on
Rowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care; an he take the
least alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished
his only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of
affection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a
distance, but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as
we bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.â€

â€œWell, you have said enough,â€ answered the Templar; â€œI will for a night
put on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but
as for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires,
with Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt
not that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.â€

â€œWe must not let it come so far,â€ answered the Prior; â€œbut here is the
clownâ€™s sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see
which of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the
left.â€

â€œTo the right,â€ said Brian, â€œto the best of my remembrance.â€

â€œTo the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his
wooden sword.â€

â€œAy, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his
body with it,â€ said the Templar.

Each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in
all such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been
near enough to hear Wambaâ€™s directions. At length Brian remarked, what
had at first escaped him in the twilight; â€œHere is some one either
asleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross--Hugo, stir him with the
butt-end of thy lance.â€

This was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good
French, â€œWhosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my
thoughts.â€

â€œWe did but wish to ask you,â€ said the Prior, â€œthe road to Rotherwood,
the abode of Cedric the Saxon.â€

â€œI myself am bound thither,â€ replied the stranger; â€œand if I had a
horse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though
perfectly well known to me.â€

â€œThou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,â€ said the Prior, â€œif
thou wilt bring us to Cedricâ€™s in safety.â€

And he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give
that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve
for a guide.

Their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had
recommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led
deeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach
to which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed;
but the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground
and the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention,
brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet
seen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper
extremity, he said to the Prior, â€œYonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of
Cedric the Saxon.â€

This was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the
strongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course
of passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the
curiosity to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at his
ease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he demanded of
the guide who and what he was.

â€œA Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,â€ was the answer.

â€œYou had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the Holy
Sepulchre,â€ said the Templar.

â€œTrue, Reverend Sir Knight,â€ answered the Palmer, to whom the appearance
of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; â€œbut when those who are under
oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at such a distance
from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a peaceful peasant
like me should decline the task which they have abandoned?â€

The Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the
Prior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after
such long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of
the forest.

â€œI was born a native of these parts,â€ answered their guide, and as he
made the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;--a low irregular
building, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over
a considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the
inhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,
turretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility
resided, and which had become the universal style of architecture
throughout England.

Rotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in
that disturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being
plundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch,
was drawn round the whole building, and filled with water from a
neighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of pointed
beams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer and inner
bank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west through the
outer stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a similar
opening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been taken to
place those entrances under the protection of projecting angles, by
which they might be flanked in case of need by archers or slingers.

Before this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain,
which had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.




CHAPTER III

     Then (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears
     The German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,
     And yellow hairâ€™d, the blue-eyed Saxon came.
     Thomsonâ€™s Liberty

In a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its
extreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks
rough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish,
stood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The roof,
composed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the apartment from
the sky excepting the planking and thatch; there was a huge fireplace at
either end of the hall, but as the chimneys were constructed in a very
clumsy manner, at least as much of the smoke found its way into the
apartment as escaped by the proper vent. The constant vapour which this
occasioned, had polished the rafters and beams of the low-browed hall,
by encrusting them with a black varnish of soot. On the sides of the
apartment hung implements of war and of the chase, and there were at
each corner folding doors, which gave access to other parts of the
extensive building.

The other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity
of the Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining.
The floor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard
substance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For
about one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised
by a step, and this space, which was called the dais, was occupied only
by the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction.
For this purpose, a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed
transversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the
longer and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior persons fed,
down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form of the
letter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which, arranged on the
same principles, may be still seen in the antique Colleges of Oxford or
Cambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved oak were placed upon the
dais, and over these seats and the more elevated table was fastened a
canopy of cloth, which served in some degree to protect the dignitaries
who occupied that distinguished station from the weather, and
especially from the rain, which in some places found its way through the
ill-constructed roof.

The walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended,
were covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a
carpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or
embroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the
lower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering;
the rough plastered walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor was
uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive benches
supplied the place of chairs.

In the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated
than the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided
over the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon
title of honour, which signifies â€œthe Dividers of Bread.â€

To each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and
inlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One
of these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though
but in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt, at
the delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might have
become an alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.

It appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he
was of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the
middle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made,
like one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his
face was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine
teeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of
good-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride and
jealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been spent in asserting
rights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the prompt, fiery,
and resolute disposition of the man, had been kept constantly upon the
alert by the circumstances of his situation. His long yellow hair was
equally divided on the top of his head and upon his brow, and combed
down on each side to the length of his shoulders; it had but little
tendency to grey, although Cedric was approaching to his sixtieth year.

His dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs
with what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to
ermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel.
This doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat
tight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach
below the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His
feet had sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of finer
materials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had bracelets
of gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same precious metal
around his neck. About his waist he wore a richly-studded belt, in
which was stuck a short straight two-edged sword, with a sharp point, so
disposed as to hang almost perpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat
was hung a scarlet cloth cloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same
materials richly embroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent
landholder when he chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad
and bright steel head, also reclined against the back of his chair,
which served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or
of a weapon, as chance might require.

Several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the
richness of their masterâ€™s, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth
the swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon
dignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their
master upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall.
Other attendants there were of a different description; two or three
large and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the
stag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick
necks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs,
now called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the
supper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to
their race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master,
apprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedricâ€™s
trencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged
dependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an
indulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state, and
occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy head
upon his masterâ€™s knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he was
repelled by the stern command, â€œDown, Balder, down! I am not in the
humour for foolery.â€

In fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of
mind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at
a distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,
which had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of
Gurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from
the forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it
probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the
outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence
of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made
him equally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of
consequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon
proprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in
forest-land, where those animals easily found their food.

Besides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for the
presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they were,
served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep
draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying
it. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper
hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires,
both in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was expressed in
broken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the
domestics who stood around; and particularly to his cupbearer, who
offered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver goblet filled
with wine--â€œWhy tarries the Lady Rowena?â€

â€œShe is but changing her head-gear,â€ replied a female attendant, with as
much confidence as the favourite ladyâ€™s-maid usually answers the master
of a modern family; â€œyou would not wish her to sit down to the banquet
in her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be quicker in
arraying herself than my mistress.â€

This undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the
part of the Saxon, with the addition, â€œI wish her devotion may choose
fair weather for the next visit to St Johnâ€™s Kirk;--but what, in the
name of ten devils,â€ continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising
his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert
his indignation without fear or control--â€œwhat, in the name of ten
devils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an evil
account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge,
and I had destined him for something better; perchance I might even have
made him one of my warders.â€ [11]

Oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, â€œthat it was scarce an hour
since the tolling of the curfew;â€ an ill-chosen apology, since it turned
upon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.

â€œThe foul fiend,â€ exclaimed Cedric, â€œtake the curfew-bell, and the
tyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who
names it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!â€ he added,
pausing, â€œay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their
lights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!--Ay,
the curfew;--Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Philip de Malvoisin know the
use of the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or eâ€™er a
Norman adventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess,
that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry
banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful
slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and Wamba--where
is Wamba? Said not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?â€

Oswald replied in the affirmative.

â€œAy? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon
fool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve them,
and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born
with but half our wits. But I will be avenged,â€ he added, starting from
his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his
boar-spear; â€œI will go with my complaint to the great council; I have
friends, I have followers--man to man will I appeal the Norman to the
lists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can render
cowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a stronger
fence than three of their war shields!--Haply they think me old; but
they shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of Hereward is
in the veins of Cedric.--Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!â€ he exclaimed in a lower
tone, â€œcouldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion, thy father
had not been left in his age like the solitary oak that throws out
its shattered and unprotected branches against the full sweep of the
tempest!â€ The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness his irritated
feelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat, bent his looks
downward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy reflection.

From his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn,
which was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs
in the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other
parts of the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon,
well seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine
clamour.

â€œTo the gate, knaves!â€ said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult
was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. â€œSee what
tidings that horn tells us of--to announce, I ween, some hership [12]
and robbery which has been done upon my lands.â€

Returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced â€œthat the Prior
Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert, commander
of the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with a small
retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on
their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from
Ashby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from the present.â€

â€œAymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?â€--muttered Cedric;
â€œNormans both;--but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood must
not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt--more
welcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way--But it
were unworthy to murmur for a nightâ€™s lodging and a nightâ€™s food; in
the quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their
insolence.--Go, Hundebert,â€ he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood
behind him with a white wand; â€œtake six of the attendants, and introduce
the strangers to the guestsâ€™ lodging. Look after their horses and mules,
and see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of vestments if
they require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and ale; and bid
the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal; and let it
be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share it. Say to
them, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome, but he is
under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais of his own
hall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty. Begone! see
them carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the Saxon churl
has shown at once his poverty and his avarice.â€

The major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his masterâ€™s
commands.

â€œThe Prior Aymer!â€ repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, â€œthe brother, if
I mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?â€

Oswald made a respectful sign of assent. â€œHis brother sits in the
seat, and usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of
Middleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they
say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn
better than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be welcome. How
named ye the Templar?â€

â€œBrian de Bois-Guilbert.â€

â€œBois-Guilbert,â€ said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,
which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,
and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those
around him--â€œBois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for
good and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;
but stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and
voluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,
nor awe of heaven. So say the few warriors who have returned from
Palestine.--Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome
too.--Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the
mightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most
odoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns [13]
--Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure.--Elgitha, let
thy Lady Rowena, know we shall not this night expect her in the hall,
unless such be her especial pleasure.â€

â€œBut it will be her especial pleasure,â€ answered Elgitha, with great
readiness, â€œfor she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from
Palestine.â€

Cedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but
Rowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from
his anger. He only replied, â€œSilence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy
discretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her pleasure.
Here, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a princess.â€
 Elgitha left the apartment.

â€œPalestine!â€ repeated the Saxon; â€œPalestine! how many ears are turned
to the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring
from that fatal land! I too might ask--I too might enquire--I too might
listen with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise
to cheat us into hospitality--but no--The son who has disobeyed me is no
longer mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that
of the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on
their shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it
an accomplishment of the will of God.â€

He knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as
he raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast
wide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics
bearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the
apartment.

The Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his
riding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore
a cope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring,
which marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary
to the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the
finest leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as
small dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven
crown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.

The appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though
less studiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and
his appearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had
exchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk,
garnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white,
in ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the
shoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested
his brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of
a raven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion.
Nothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner,
had they not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily
acquired by the exercise of unresisted authority.

These two dignified persons were followed by their respective
attendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure
had nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a
pilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole
body. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar,
having similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a â€œSclaveynâ€,
or â€œSclavonianâ€. Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his bare feet;
a broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its brim, and
a long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was attached a
branch of palm, completed the palmerâ€™s attire. He followed modestly the
last of the train which entered the hall, and, observing that the lower
table scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics of Cedric and
the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed beside and
almost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ himself in
drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should make room
at the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply him with
refreshments in the place he had chosen apart.

Cedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality,
and, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three
steps towards them, and then awaited their approach.

â€œI grieve,â€ he said, â€œreverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance
no farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests
as you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has
expounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray,
that you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that
you will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I
sufficiently understand Norman to follow your meaning.â€

â€œVows,â€ said the Abbot, â€œmust be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit
me rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows
are the knots which tie us to Heaven--they are the cords which bind
the sacrifice to the horns of the altar,--and are therefore,--as I said
before,--to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church
shall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly
hold communication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda
of Middleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may
presume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of
Whitby, God be gracious to her soul!â€

When the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue,
his companion said briefly and emphatically, â€œI speak ever French,
the language of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English
sufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country.â€

Cedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,
which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call
forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed
further show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his
guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close
beside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed
upon the board.

While the attendants hastened to obey Cedricâ€™s commands, his eye
distinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had
just entered the hall. â€œSend these loitering knaves up hither,â€ said the
Saxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the dais,--â€œHow
comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? Hast
thou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou left them to
robbers and marauders?â€

â€œThe herd is safe, so please ye,â€ said Gurth.

â€œBut it does not please me, thou knave,â€ said Cedric, â€œthat I should be
made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising vengeance
against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I tell thee,
shackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence of this
kind.â€

Gurth, knowing his masterâ€™s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;
but the Jester, who could presume upon Cedricâ€™s tolerance, by virtue
of his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; â€œIn troth, uncle
Cedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.â€

â€œâ€˜How, sir?â€ said his master; â€œyou shall to the porterâ€™s lodge, and
taste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.â€

â€œFirst let your wisdom tell me,â€ said Wamba, â€œis it just and reasonable
to punish one person for the fault of another?â€

â€œCertainly not, fool,â€ answered Cedric.

â€œThen why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog
Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had
got our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard the
vesper-bell.â€

â€œThen hang up Fangs,â€ said Cedric, turning hastily towards the
swineherd, â€œif the fault is his, and get thee another dog.â€

â€œUnder favour, uncle,â€ said the Jester, â€œthat were still somewhat on the
bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was lame
and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off
two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had
been consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.â€

â€œAnd who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?â€ said
the Saxon, kindling in wrath.

â€œMarry, that did old Hubert,â€ said Wamba, â€œSir Philip de Malvoisinâ€™s
keeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said
he chased the deer contrary to his masterâ€™s right, as warden of the
walk.â€

â€œThe foul fiend take Malvoisin,â€ answered the Saxon, â€œand his keeper
both! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of
the great Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy
place--and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare
to touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head,
if I strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!--he shall draw
bowstring no more.--I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset
here with neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy Land.
But your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make amends
for hard fare.â€

The feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no apologies
from the lord of the mansion. Swineâ€™s flesh, dressed in several modes,
appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of fowls, deer,
goats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with huge loaves
and cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits and honey.
The smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was abundance, were
not served up in platters, but brought in upon small wooden spits or
broaches, and offered by the pages and domestics who bore them, to each
guest in succession, who cut from them such a portion as he pleased.
Beside each person of rank was placed a goblet of silver; the lower
board was accommodated with large drinking horns.

When the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward,
suddenly raising his wand, said aloud,--â€œForbear!--Place for the Lady
Rowena.â€

A side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet
table, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the
apartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether
agreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion, hastened
to meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to the
elevated seat at his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of the
mansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their courtesy by
a mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her
place at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the Templar whispered to
the Prior, â€œI shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament.
The Chian wine is your own.â€

â€œSaid I not so?â€ answered the Prior; â€œbut check your raptures, the
Franklin observes you.â€

Unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the
immediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept
his eyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his
imagination, because differing widely from those of the Eastern
sultanas.

Formed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature,
yet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior
height. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her
head and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches
to fair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a
graceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the
forehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well
as to beseech. If mildness were the more natural expression of such a
combination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance, the
exercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general homage,
had given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled with and
qualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a colour betwixt
brown and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and graceful manner in
numerous ringlets, to form which art had probably aided nature. These
locks were braided with gems, and, being worn at full length, intimated
the noble birth and free-born condition of the maiden. A golden chain,
to which was attached a small reliquary of the same metal, hung round
her neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which were bare. Her dress was
an under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green silk, over which hung a long
loose robe, which reached to the ground, having very wide sleeves, which
came down, however, very little below the elbow. This robe was crimson,
and manufactured out of the very finest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven
with gold, was attached to the upper part of it, which could be, at
the wearerâ€™s pleasure, either drawn over the face and bosom after the
Spanish fashion, or disposed as a sort of drapery round the shoulders.

When Rowena perceived the Knight Templarâ€™s eyes bent on her with an
ardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved,
gave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the veil
around her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of his
glance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. â€œSir
Templar,â€ said he, â€œthe cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too little
of the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a crusader.â€

â€œIf I have offended,â€ replied Sir Brian, â€œI crave your pardon,--that
is, I crave the Lady Rowenaâ€™s pardon,--for my humility will carry me no
lower.â€

â€œThe Lady Rowena,â€ said the Prior, â€œhas punished us all, in chastising
the boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the
splendid train which are to meet at the tournament.â€

â€œOur going thither,â€ said Cedric, â€œis uncertain. I love not these
vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free.â€

â€œLet us hope, nevertheless,â€ said the Prior, â€œour company may determine
you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of
Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.â€

â€œSir Prior,â€ answered the Saxon, â€œwheresoever I have travelled in this
land, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword
and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At present,
if we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my noble
neighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with such a
train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.--I drink
to you, Sir Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste will
approve, and I thank you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid
in adhering to monastic rule,â€ he added, â€œas to prefer your acid
preparation of milk, I hope you will not strain courtesy to do me
reason.â€

â€œNay,â€ said the Priest, laughing, â€œit is only in our abbey that we
confine ourselves to the â€˜lac dulceâ€™ or the â€˜lac acidumâ€™ either.
Conversing with, the world, we use the worldâ€™s fashions, and therefore
I answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the weaker liquor to
my lay-brother.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ said the Templar, filling his goblet, â€œdrink wassail to the
fair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England,
has never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could
pardon the unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now witness,
for making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.â€

â€œI will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,â€ said Rowena with dignity, and
without unveiling herself; â€œor rather I will tax it so far as to require
of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable to our
English ears than the compliments which your French breeding teaches.â€

â€œI have little of importance to say, lady,â€ answered Sir Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, â€œexcepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with
Saladin.â€

He was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon
a chair, the back of which was decorated with two assâ€™s ears, and which
was placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time
to time, supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour,
however, which the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we
have already noticed, there were several in attendance. Here sat Wamba,
with a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of
the chair, his cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble a pair
of nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with alertness
every opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery.

â€œThese truces with the infidels,â€ he exclaimed, without caring how
suddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, â€œmake an old man of me!â€

â€œGo to, knave, how so?â€ said Cedric, his features prepared to receive
favourably the expected jest.

â€œBecause,â€ answered Wamba, â€œI remember three of them in my day, each
of which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by
computation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.â€

â€œI will warrant you against dying of old age, however,â€ said the
Templar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; â€œI will assure
you from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to
wayfarers, as you did this night to the Prior and me.â€

â€œHow, sirrah!â€ said Cedric, â€œmisdirect travellers? We must have you
whipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool.â€

â€œI pray thee, uncle,â€ answered the Jester, â€œlet my folly, for once,
protect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and
my left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his
counsellor and guide.â€

Conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porterâ€™s
page, who announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring
admittance and hospitality.

â€œAdmit him,â€ said Cedric, â€œbe he who or what he may;--a night like that
which roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and to
seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by
the elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care--look to it,
Oswald.â€

And the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his
patron obeyed.




CHAPTER V


  Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,
  senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with
  the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the
  same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
  a Christian is?
  --Merchant of Venice

Oswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, â€œIt is a Jew,
who calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into
the hall?â€

â€œLet Gurth do thine office, Oswald,â€ said Wamba with his usual
effrontery; â€œthe swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew.â€

â€œSt Mary,â€ said the Abbot, crossing himself, â€œan unbelieving Jew, and
admitted into this presence!â€

â€œA dog Jew,â€ echoed the Templar, â€œto approach a defender of the Holy
Sepulchre?â€

â€œBy my faith,â€ said Wamba, â€œit would seem the Templars love the Jewsâ€™
inheritance better than they do their company.â€

â€œPeace, my worthy guests,â€ said Cedric; â€œmy hospitality must not be
bounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of
stiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we may
endure the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no man
to converse or to feed with him.--Let him have a board and a morsel
apart,--unless,â€ he said smiling, â€œthese turbanâ€™d strangers will admit
his society.â€

â€œSir Franklin,â€ answered the Templar, â€œmy Saracen slaves are true
Moslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a
Jew.â€

â€œNow, in faith,â€ said Wamba, â€œI cannot see that the worshippers of
Mahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people
once chosen of Heaven.â€

â€œHe shall sit with thee, Wamba,â€ said Cedric; â€œthe fool and the knave
will be well met.â€

â€œThe fool,â€ answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon,
â€œwill take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.â€

â€œHush,â€ said Cedric, â€œfor here he comes.â€

Introduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and hesitation,
and many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who, however, had
lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height, approached the
lower end of the board. His features, keen and regular, with an aquiline
nose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled forehead, and long
grey hair and beard, would have been considered as handsome, had they
not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a race, which, during
those dark ages, was alike detested by the credulous and prejudiced
vulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and rapacious nobility, and who,
perhaps, owing to that very hatred and persecution, had adopted a
national character, in which there was much, to say the least, mean and
unamiable.

The Jewâ€™s dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the
storm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple
tunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his
waist, which sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing
materials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a peculiar
fashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish them from Christians, and
which he doffed with great humility at the door of the hall.

The reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such
as might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of
Israel. Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jewâ€™s repeated
salutations, and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the
table, where, however, no one offered to make room for him. On the
contrary, as he passed along the file, casting a timid supplicating
glance, and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of
the board, the Saxon domestics squared their shoulders, and continued
to devour their supper with great perseverance, paying not the least
attention to the wants of the new guest. The attendants of the Abbot
crossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen
Saracens, as Isaac drew near them, curled up their whiskers with
indignation, and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to
rid themselves by the most desperate means from the apprehended
contamination of his nearer approach.

Probably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this
son of a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants
receiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment,
engaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character
of his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for matters
of much greater importance than that of a Jew going to bed supperless.
While Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society, like his
people among the nations, looking in vain for welcome or resting
place, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon him, and
resigned his seat, saying briefly, â€œOld man, my garments are dried,
my hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting.â€ So saying, he
gathered together, and brought to a flame, the decaying brands which
lay scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger board a mess of
pottage and seethed kid, placed it upon the small table at which he had
himself supped, and, without waiting the Jewâ€™s thanks, went to the
other side of the hall;--whether from unwillingness to hold more close
communication with the object of his benevolence, or from a wish to draw
near to the upper end of the table, seemed uncertain.

Had there been painters in those days capable to execute such a subject,
the Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his chilled and
trembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad emblematical
personification of the Winter season. Having dispelled the cold, he
turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before him, and
ate with a haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to betoken long
abstinence from food.

Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting;
the Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her attendant
females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the Jew to
the Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to
interest him.

â€œI marvel, worthy Cedric,â€ said the Abbot, as their discourse proceeded,
â€œthat, great as your predilection is for your own manly language, you do
not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far at least as the
mystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely no tongue is so
rich in the various phrases which the field-sports demand, or furnishes
means to the experienced woodman so well to express his jovial art.â€

â€œGood Father Aymer,â€ said the Saxon, â€œbe it known to you, I care not
for those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take my
pleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast
either a â€˜recheateâ€™ or a â€˜morteâ€™--I can cheer my dogs on the prey, and
I can flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without using
the newfangled jargon of â€˜curee, arbor, nomblesâ€™, and all the babble of
the fabulous Sir Tristrem.â€ [14]

â€œThe French,â€ said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous
and authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, â€œis not only
the natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in which
ladies should be won and enemies defied.â€

â€œPledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,â€ said Cedric, â€œand fill
another to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you
another tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale
needed no garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear
of beauty; and the field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy
Standard, could tell whether the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far
within the ranks of the Scottish host as the â€˜cri de guerreâ€™ of
the boldest Norman baron. To the memory of the brave who fought
there!--Pledge me, my guests.â€ He drank deep, and went on with
increasing warmth. â€œAy, that was a day of cleaving of shields, when a
hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and
blood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight.
A Saxon bard had called it a feast of the swords--a gathering of the
eagles to the prey--the clashing of bills upon shield and helmet, the
shouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our
bards are no more,â€ he said; â€œour deeds are lost in those of another
race--our language--our very name--is hastening to decay, and none
mourns for it save one solitary old man--Cupbearer! knave, fill the
goblets--To the strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language
what it will, who now bear them best in Palestine among the champions of
the Cross!â€

â€œIt becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,â€ said Sir Brian de
Bois-Guilbert; â€œyet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy
Sepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?â€

â€œTo the Knights Hospitallers,â€ said the Abbot; â€œI have a brother of
their order.â€

â€œI impeach not their fame,â€ said the Templar; â€œnevertheless---â€

â€œI think, friend Cedric,â€ said Wamba, interfering, â€œthat had Richard
of the Lionâ€™s Heart been wise enough to have taken a foolâ€™s advice,
he might have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the
recovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the
loss of it.â€

â€œWere there, then, none in the English army,â€ said the Lady Rowena,
â€œwhose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple,
and of St John?â€

â€œForgive me, lady,â€ replied De Bois-Guilbert; â€œthe English monarch did,
indeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to
those whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed
land.â€

â€œSecond to NONE,â€ said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear,
and had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All turned
toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was heard.

â€œI say,â€ repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice, â€œthat the
English chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in defence of
the Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself,
and five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St
John-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that
day, each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three
antagonists. I add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the
Temple--and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I
tell you.â€

It is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage
which rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In the
extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped
towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the
consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that
place and presence. Cedric, whose feelings were all of a right onward
and simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one object at
once, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the glory of
his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; â€œI would
give thee this golden bracelet, Pilgrim,â€ he said, â€œcouldst thou tell me
the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown of merry
England.â€

â€œThat will I do blithely,â€ replied the Pilgrim, â€œand without guerdon; my
oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.â€

â€œI will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,â€ said
Wamba.

â€œThe first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,â€ said the
Pilgrim, â€œwas the brave Richard, King of England.â€

â€œI forgive him,â€ said Cedric; â€œI forgive him his descent from the tyrant
Duke William.â€

â€œThe Earl of Leicester was the second,â€ continued the Pilgrim; â€œSir
Thomas Multon of Gilsland was the third.â€

â€œOf Saxon descent, he at least,â€ said Cedric, with exultation.

â€œSir Foulk Doilly the fourth,â€ proceeded the Pilgrim.

â€œSaxon also, at least by the motherâ€™s side,â€ continued Cedric, who
listened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his
hatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and
his islanders. â€œAnd who was the fifth?â€ he demanded.

â€œThe fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham.â€

â€œGenuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!â€ shouted Cedric--â€œAnd the
sixth?â€ he continued with eagerness--â€œhow name you the sixth?â€

â€œThe sixth,â€ said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to
recollect himself, â€œwas a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,
assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than
to make up their number--his name dwells not in my memory.â€

â€œSir Palmer,â€ said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, â€œthis assumed
forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to
serve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before
whose lance fortune and my horseâ€™s fault occasioned my falling--it was
the Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years,
had more renown in arms.--Yet this will I say, and loudly--that were he
in England, and durst repeat, in this weekâ€™s tournament, the challenge
of St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would give him
every advantage of weapons, and abide the result.â€

â€œYour challenge would soon be answered,â€ replied the Palmer, â€œwere your
antagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall
with vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot
take place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his surety
that he meets you.â€

â€œA goodly security!â€ said the Knight Templar; â€œand what do you proffer
as a pledge?â€

â€œThis reliquary,â€ said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his
bosom, and crossing himself, â€œcontaining a portion of the true cross,
brought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.â€

The Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in
which all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the
Templar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying
any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck
a gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying--â€œLet Prior Aymer
hold my pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the
Knight of Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies
the challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, which, if he answer not, I will
proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in Europe.â€

â€œIt will not need,â€ said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; â€œMy voice
shall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the
absent Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable challenge.
Could my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge of this
holy pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives this proud
knight the meeting he desires.â€

A crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and
kept him silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment,
embarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the
shadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants,
on whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost
electrical, hung in suspense upon their masterâ€™s looks. But when Rowena
spoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.

â€œLady,â€ said Cedric, â€œthis beseems not; were further pledge necessary, I
myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my honour
for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete, even
according to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry--Is it not,
Father Aymer?â€

â€œIt is,â€ replied the Prior; â€œand the blessed relic and rich chain will I
bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision of this
warlike challenge.â€

Having thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after
many genuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to
Brother Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with less
ceremony, but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the golden
chain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather, which
opened under his arm. â€œAnd now, Sir Cedric,â€ he said, â€œmy ears are
chiming vespers with the strength of your good wine--permit us another
pledge to the welfare of the Lady Rowena, and indulge us with liberty to
pass to our repose.â€

â€œBy the rood of Bromholme,â€ said the Saxon, â€œyou do but small credit to
your fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear
the matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to
have shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of twelve,
in my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.â€

The Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course
of temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional
peacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was
not altogether from a love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from
a mixture of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive
apprehension of the fiery temper of the Saxon, and saw the danger that
the reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had
already given so many proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable
explosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native
of any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl
with the hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but
slightly, about his own holy character, and ended by pressing his
proposal to depart to repose.

The grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after making
deep obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose and
mingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate doors,
retired with their attendants.

â€œUnbelieving dog,â€ said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him
in the throng, â€œdost thou bend thy course to the tournament?â€

â€œI do so propose,â€ replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, â€œif it please
your reverend valour.â€

â€œAy,â€ said the Knight, â€œto gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury,
and to gull women and boys with gauds and toys--I warrant thee store of
shekels in thy Jewish scrip.â€

â€œNot a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling--so help me the God
of Abraham!â€ said the Jew, clasping his hands; â€œI go but to seek the
assistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which
the Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me--Father Jacob be my
speed! I am an impoverished wretch--the very gaberdine I wear is
borrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster.â€ [15]

The Templar smiled sourly as he replied, â€œBeshrew thee for a
false-hearted liar!â€ and passing onward, as if disdaining farther
conference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to
the bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address
of the military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity
of the hall ere he raised his head from the humble posture which he had
assumed, so far as to be sensible of his departure. And when he did
look around, it was with the astonished air of one at whose feet a
thunderbolt has just burst, and who hears still the astounding report
ringing in his ears.

The Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping
apartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two
torchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of
inferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests
their respective places of repose.




CHAPTER VI

     To buy his favour I extend this friendship:
     If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
     And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
     --Merchant of Venice

As the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the
intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion,
the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had
no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were many
domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought
from the Holy Land, and particularly that which concerned the Knight of
Ivanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing
that a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew. Without
disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer thanked them
for their courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious
vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were
prohibited in the hall. â€œThat vow,â€ said Wamba to the cupbearer, â€œwould
scarce suit a serving-man.â€

The cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. â€œI thought to
have lodged him in the solere chamber,â€ said he; â€œbut since he is so
unsocial to Christians, eâ€™en let him take the next stall to Isaac the
Jewâ€™s.--Anwold,â€ said he to the torchbearer, â€œcarry the Pilgrim to the
southern cell.--I give you good-night,â€ he added, â€œSir Palmer, with
small thanks for short courtesy.â€

â€œGood-night, and Our Ladyâ€™s benison,â€ said the Palmer, with composure;
and his guide moved forward.

In a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was
lighted by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the
waiting-maid of Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her
mistress desired to speak with the Palmer, took the torch from the hand
of Anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the
Palmer to follow. Apparently he did not think it proper to decline this
invitation as he had done the former; for, though his gesture
indicated some surprise at the summons, he obeyed it without answer or
remonstrance.

A short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was
composed of a solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of the Lady
Rowena, the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect which
was paid to her by the lord of the mansion. The walls were covered with
embroidered hangings, on which different-coloured silks, interwoven with
gold and silver threads, had been employed with all the art of which the
age was capable, to represent the sports of hunting and hawking. The bed
was adorned with the same rich tapestry, and surrounded with curtains
dyed with purple. The seats had also their stained coverings, and one,
which was higher than the rest, was accommodated with a footstool of
ivory, curiously carved.

No fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches,
served to illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beauty envy the
magnificence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so ill
finished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook in the
night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to protect
them from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways into the
air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. Magnificence there was,
with some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was little, and,
being unknown, it was unmissed.

The Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and
arranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of
throne already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general homage.
The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.

â€œRise, Palmer,â€ said she graciously. â€œThe defender of the absent has
a right to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour
manhood.â€ She then said to her train, â€œRetire, excepting only Elgitha; I
would speak with this holy Pilgrim.â€

The maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further
extremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they
remained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers
could not have interrupted the conversation of their mistress.

â€œPilgrim,â€ said the lady, after a momentâ€™s pause, during which she
seemed uncertain how to address him, â€œyou this night mentioned a name--I
mean,â€ she said, with a degree of effort, â€œthe name of Ivanhoe, in
the halls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded most
acceptably; and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many
whose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, I, only, dare ask you
where, and in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?--We heard,
that, having remained in Palestine, on account of his impaired health,
after the departure of the English army, he had experienced the
persecution of the French faction, to whom the Templars are known to be
attached.â€

â€œI know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,â€ answered the Palmer, with
a troubled voice. â€œI would I knew him better, since you, lady, are
interested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution
of his enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning to England,
where you, lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of
happiness.â€

The Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the
Knight of Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether
he would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. On the first
point, the Palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the
voyage might be safely made by the way of Venice and Genoa, and from
thence through France to England. â€œIvanhoe,â€ he said, â€œwas so well
acquainted with the language and manners of the French, that there was
no fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.â€

â€œWould to God,â€ said the Lady Rowena, â€œhe were here safely arrived, and
able to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the chivalry
of this land are expected to display their address and valour. Should
Athelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoe is like to hear
evil tidings when he reaches England.--How looked he, stranger, when
you last saw him? Had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and
comeliness?â€

â€œHe was darker,â€ said the Palmer, â€œand thinner, than when he came from
Cyprus in the train of Coeur-de-Lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on
his brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to
me.â€

â€œHe will,â€ said the lady, â€œI fear, find little in his native land to
clear those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, for your
information concerning the companion of my childhood.--Maidens,â€ she
said, â€œdraw near--offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom I will
no longer detain from repose.â€

One of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of
wine and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It was then offered
to the Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.

â€œAccept this alms, friend,â€ continued the lady, offering a piece of
gold, â€œin acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines thou
hast visited.â€

The Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed
Edwina out of the apartment.

In the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch
from the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than
ceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number
of small apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the
lower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.

â€œIn which of these sleeps the Jew?â€ said the Pilgrim.

â€œThe unbelieving dog,â€ answered Anwold, â€œkennels in the cell next your
holiness.--St Dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be
again fit for a Christian!â€

â€œAnd where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?â€ said the stranger.

â€œGurth,â€ replied the bondsman, â€œsleeps in the cell on your right, as the
Jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision
separate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have occupied a
more honourable place had you accepted of Oswaldâ€™s invitation.â€

â€œIt is as well as it is,â€ said the Palmer; â€œthe company, even of a Jew,
can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.â€

So saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch
from the domesticâ€™s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night. Having
shut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick made of
wood, and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture of which
was of the most simple kind. It consisted of a rude wooden stool,
and still ruder hutch or bed-frame, stuffed with clean straw, and
accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.

The Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without taking
off any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or at least
retained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams found their
way through the little grated window, which served at once to admit both
air and light to his uncomfortable cell. He then started up, and after
repeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, he left it, and entered
that of Isaac the Jew, lifting the latch as gently as he could.

The inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that on
which the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such parts of his dress
as the Jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed
carefully around his person, as if to prevent the hazard of their
being carried off during his slumbers. There was a trouble on his brow
amounting almost to agony. His hands and arms moved convulsively, as
if struggling with the nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in
Hebrew, the following were distinctly heard in the Norman-English, or
mixed language of the country: â€œFor the sake of the God of Abraham,
spare an unhappy old man! I am poor, I am penniless--should your irons
wrench my limbs asunder, I could not gratify you!â€

The Palmer awaited not the end of the Jewâ€™s vision, but stirred him with
his pilgrimâ€™s staff. The touch probably associated, as is usual, with
some of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man started
up, his grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and huddling some
part of his garments about him, while he held the detached pieces with
the tenacious grasp of a falcon, he fixed upon the Palmer his keen black
eyes, expressive of wild surprise and of bodily apprehension.

â€œFear nothing from me, Isaac,â€ said the Palmer, â€œI come as your friend.â€

â€œThe God of Israel requite you,â€ said the Jew, greatly relieved; â€œI
dreamed--But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a dream.â€ Then,
collecting himself, he added in his usual tone, â€œAnd what may it be your
pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor Jew?â€

â€œIt is to tell you,â€ said the Palmer, â€œthat if you leave not this
mansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may
prove a dangerous one.â€

â€œHoly father!â€ said the Jew, â€œwhom could it interest to endanger so poor
a wretch as I am?â€

â€œThe purpose you can best guess,â€ said the Pilgrim; â€œbut rely on this,
that when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his
Mussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and
charged them this morning to watch the journey of the Jew, to seize upon
him when at a convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct
him to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin, or to that of Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf.â€

It is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon
the Jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole
faculties. His arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his
breast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his
frame seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot of
the Palmer, not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops, kneels,
or prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man borne down on
all sides by the pressure of some invisible force, which crushes him to
the earth without the power of resistance.

â€œHoly God of Abraham!â€ was his first exclamation, folding and elevating
his wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the pavement;
â€œOh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed for nought,
and the vision cometh not in vain! I feel their irons already tear my
sinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the saws, and harrows,
and axes of iron over the men of Rabbah, and of the cities of the
children of Ammon!â€

â€œStand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,â€ said the Palmer, who viewed
the extremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was
largely mingled; â€œyou have cause for your terror, considering how your
brethren have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards, both
by princes and nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out to you
the means of escape. Leave this mansion instantly, while its inmates
sleep sound after the last nightâ€™s revel. I will guide you by the secret
paths of the forest, known as well to me as to any forester that ranges
it, and I will not leave you till you are under safe conduct of some
chief or baron going to the tournament, whose good-will you have
probably the means of securing.â€

As the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech
intimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise
himself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees,
throwing back his long grey hair and beard, and fixing his keen black
eyes upon the Palmerâ€™s face, with a look expressive at once of hope and
fear, not unmingled with suspicion. But when he heard the concluding
part of the sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full
force, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming, â€œâ€˜Iâ€™ possess the
means of securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour
of a Christian, and how can the poor Jew find it, whom extortions have
already reduced to the misery of Lazarus?â€ Then, as if suspicion had
overpowered his other feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, â€œFor the love of
God, young man, betray me not--for the sake of the Great Father who
made us all, Jew as well as Gentile, Israelite and Ishmaelite--do me no
treason! I have not means to secure the good-will of a Christian beggar,
were he rating it at a single penny.â€ As he spoke these last words, he
raised himself, and grasped the Palmerâ€™s mantle with a look of the
most earnest entreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if there were
contamination in the touch.

â€œWert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,â€ he said, â€œwhat
interest have I to injure thee?--In this dress I am vowed to poverty,
nor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet think
not that I care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it;
remain here if thou wilt--Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said the Jew, â€œhe will not let me travel in his train--Saxon or
Norman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and to travel
by myself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf--Good youth, I will go with you!--Let us haste--let
us gird up our loins--let us flee!--Here is thy staff, why wilt thou
tarry?â€

â€œI tarry not,â€ said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his
companion; â€œbut I must secure the means of leaving this place--follow
me.â€

He led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,
was occupied by Gurth the swineherd.--â€œArise, Gurth,â€ said the Pilgrim,
â€œarise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and me.â€

Gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much
consequence in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus in Ithaca, was offended
at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. â€œThe Jew
leaving Rotherwood,â€ said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking
superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, â€œand travelling in
company with the Palmer to boot--â€

â€œI should as soon have dreamt,â€ said Wamba, who entered the apartment at
the instant, â€œof his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.â€

â€œNevertheless,â€ said Gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log
which served him for a pillow, â€œboth Jew and Gentile must be content to
abide the opening of the great gate--we suffer no visitors to depart by
stealth at these unseasonable hours.â€

â€œNevertheless,â€ said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, â€œyou will not, I
think, refuse me that favour.â€

So saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and
whispered something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as if
electrified. The Pilgrim, raising his finger in an attitude as if to
express caution, added, â€œGurth, beware--thou are wont to be prudent. I
say, undo the postern--thou shalt know more anon.â€

With hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed,
both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherdâ€™s demeanour. â€œMy
mule, my mule!â€ said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.

â€œFetch him his mule,â€ said the Pilgrim; â€œand, hearest thou,--let me have
another, that I may bear him company till he is beyond these parts--I
will return it safely to some of Cedricâ€™s train at Ashby. And do
thouâ€--he whispered the rest in Gurthâ€™s ear.

â€œWillingly, most willingly shall it be done,â€ said Gurth, and instantly
departed to execute the commission.

â€œI wish I knew,â€ said Wamba, when his comradeâ€™s back was turned, â€œwhat
you Palmers learn in the Holy Land.â€

â€œTo say our orisons, fool,â€ answered the Pilgrim, â€œto repent our sins,
and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.â€

â€œSomething more potent than that,â€ answered the Jester; â€œfor when would
repentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil
persuade him to lend you a mule?--I trow you might as well have told his
favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten
as civil an answer.â€

â€œGo to,â€ said the Pilgrim, â€œthou art but a Saxon fool.â€

â€œThou sayst well,â€ said the Jester; â€œhad I been born a Norman, as I
think thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been next door to
a wise man.â€

At this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the
mules. The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two
planks breadth, the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness
of the postern, and with a little wicket in the exterior palisade, which
gave access to the forest. No sooner had they reached the mules, than
the Jew, with hasty and trembling hands, secured behind the saddle
a small bag of blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak,
containing, as he muttered, â€œa change of raiment--only a change of
raiment.â€ Then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste
than could have been anticipated from his years, he lost no time in so
disposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from
observation the burden which he had thus deposited â€œen croupeâ€.

The Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,
his hand to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.
The swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost
under the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his
reverie by the voice of Wamba.

â€œKnowest thou,â€ said the Jester, â€œmy good friend Gurth, that thou art
strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? I
would I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy
unwonted zeal and courtesy--certes, I would make more out of it than a
kiss of the hand.â€

â€œThou art no fool thus far, Wamba,â€ answered Gurth, â€œthough thou arguest
from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more--But it is time to
look after my charge.â€

So saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.

Meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a
dispatch which argued the extremity of the Jewâ€™s fears, since persons at
his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every path
and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the
most devious paths, and more than once excited anew the suspicion of
the Israelite, that he intended to betray him into some ambuscade of his
enemies.

His doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the
flying fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or
the waters, who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and
relentless persecution as the Jews of this period. Upon the slightest
and most unreasonable pretences, as well as upon accusations the most
absurd and groundless, their persons and property were exposed to every
turn of popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Briton, however
adverse these races were to each other, contended which should look with
greatest detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a point of
religion to hate, to revile, to despise, to plunder, and to persecute.
The kings of the Norman race, and the independent nobles, who followed
their example in all acts of tyranny, maintained against this devoted
people a persecution of a more regular, calculated, and self-interested
kind. It is a well-known story of King John, that he confined a wealthy
Jew in one of the royal castles, and daily caused one of his teeth to
be torn out, until, when the jaw of the unhappy Israelite was half
disfurnished, he consented to pay a large sum, which it was the tyrantâ€™s
object to extort from him. The little ready money which was in the
country was chiefly in possession of this persecuted people, and the
nobility hesitated not to follow the example of their sovereign, in
wringing it from them by every species of oppression, and even personal
torture. Yet the passive courage inspired by the love of gain, induced
the Jews to dare the various evils to which they were subjected, in
consideration of the immense profits which they were enabled to realize
in a country naturally so wealthy as England. In spite of every kind
of discouragement, and even of the special court of taxations already
mentioned, called the Jewsâ€™ Exchequer, erected for the very purpose of
despoiling and distressing them, the Jews increased, multiplied, and
accumulated huge sums, which they transferred from one hand to another
by means of bills of exchange--an invention for which commerce is said
to be indebted to them, and which enabled them to transfer their wealth
from land to land, that when threatened with oppression in one country,
their treasure might be secured in another.

The obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed
in opposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they
lived, seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which
they were visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in
commerce, while it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times
used to extend their influence, and to secure to them a certain
degree of protection. On these terms they lived; and their character,
influenced accordingly, was watchful, suspicious, and timid--yet
obstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading the dangers to which they
were exposed.

When the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious
paths, the Palmer at length broke silence.

â€œThat large decayed oak,â€ he said, â€œmarks the boundaries over which
Front-de-Boeuf claims authority--we are long since far from those of
Malvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.â€

â€œMay the wheels of their chariots be taken off,â€ said the Jew, â€œlike
those of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!--But leave me
not, good Pilgrim--Think but of that fierce and savage Templar, with
his Saracen slaves--they will regard neither territory, nor manor, nor
lordship.â€

â€œOur road,â€ said the Palmer, â€œshould here separate; for it beseems not
men of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must
be. Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful Pilgrim,
against two armed heathens?â€

â€œO good youth,â€ answered the Jew, â€œthou canst defend me, and I know thou
wouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it--not with money, for money, so
help me my Father Abraham, I have none--but---â€

â€œMoney and recompense,â€ said the Palmer, interrupting him, â€œI have
already said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it may be,
even in some sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a Saracen,
can scarce be accounted unworthy of a Christian. Therefore, Jew, I will
see thee safe under some fitting escort. We are now not far from the
town of Sheffield, where thou mayest easily find many of thy tribe with
whom to take refuge.â€

â€œThe blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!â€ said the Jew; â€œin
Sheffield I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and find some means of
travelling forth with safety.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ said the Palmer; â€œat Sheffield then we part, and
half-an-hourâ€™s riding will bring us in sight of that town.â€

The half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim
perhaps disdaining to address the Jew, except in case of absolute
necessity, and the Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a
person whose journey to the Holy Sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to
his character. They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the
Pilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield, which lay beneath them,
repeated the words, â€œHere, then, we part.â€

â€œNot till you have had the poor Jewâ€™s thanks,â€ said Isaac; â€œfor I
presume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zarethâ€™s, who might
aid me with some means of repaying your good offices.â€

â€œI have already said,â€ answered the Pilgrim, â€œthat I desire no
recompense. If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for my
sake, spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who
stands in thy danger, I shall hold this morningâ€™s service to thee well
bestowed.â€

â€œStay, stay,â€ said the Jew, laying hold of his garment; â€œsomething
would I do more than this, something for thyself.--God knows the Jew
is poor--yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe--but forgive me should I
guess what thou most lackest at this moment.â€

â€œIf thou wert to guess truly,â€ said the Palmer, â€œit is what thou canst
not supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.â€

â€œAs I say?â€ echoed the Jew; â€œO! believe it, I say but the truth; I am
a plundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrung from me my
goods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed--Yet I can tell thee
what thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. Thy wish even now is
for a horse and armour.â€

The Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:--â€œWhat fiend
prompted that guess?â€ said he, hastily.

â€œNo matter,â€ said the Jew, smiling, â€œso that it be a true one--and, as I
can guess thy want, so I can supply it.â€

â€œBut consider,â€ said the Palmer, â€œmy character, my dress, my vow.â€

â€œI know you Christians,â€ replied the Jew, â€œand that the noblest of you
will take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and walk afoot
to visit the graves of dead men.â€

â€œBlaspheme not, Jew,â€ said the Pilgrim, sternly.

â€œForgive me,â€ said the Jew; â€œI spoke rashly. But there dropt words from
you last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint, showed
the metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmerâ€™s gown, is hidden a
knightâ€™s chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as you stooped over my
bed in the morning.â€

The Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. â€œWere thy garments searched by as
curious an eye, Isaac,â€ said he, â€œwhat discoveries might not be made?â€

â€œNo more of that,â€ said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth his
writing materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, he began to
write upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his
yellow cap, without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he
delivered the scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the Pilgrim,
saying, â€œIn the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew, Kirjath
Jairam of Lombardy; give him this scroll--he hath on sale six Milan
harnesses, the worst would suit a crowned head--ten goodly steeds, the
worst might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of these
he will give thee thy choice, with every thing else that can furnish
thee forth for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt return them
safely--unless thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the
owner.â€

â€œBut, Isaac,â€ said the Pilgrim, smiling, â€œdost thou know that in these
sports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to
his victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace
or repay.â€

The Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting
his courage, he replied hastily. â€œNo--no--no--It is impossible--I will
not think so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon thee. Thy lance
will be powerful as the rod of Moses.â€

So saying, he was turning his muleâ€™s head away, when the Palmer, in his
turn, took hold of his gaberdine. â€œNay, but Isaac, thou knowest not all
the risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured--for I will spare
neither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for
nothing; something there must be paid for their use.â€

The Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the colic;
but his better feelings predominated over those which were most familiar
to him. â€œI care not,â€ he said, â€œI care not--let me go. If there is
damage, it will cost you nothing--if there is usage money, Kirjath
Jairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee
well!--Yet hark thee, good youth,â€ said he, turning about, â€œthrust
thyself not too forward into this vain hurly-burly--I speak not for
endangering the steed, and coat of armour, but for the sake of thine own
life and limbs.â€

â€œGramercy for thy caution,â€ said the Palmer, again smiling; â€œI will use
thy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I will requite
it.â€

They parted, and took different roads for the town of Sheffield.




CHAPTER VII

     Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,
     In gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;
     One laced the helm, another held the lance,
     A third the shining buckler did advance.
     The courser pawâ€™d the ground with restless feet,
     And snorting foamâ€™d and champâ€™d the golden bit.
     The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,
     Files in their hands, and hammers at their side;
     And nails for loosenâ€™d spears, and thongs for shields provide.
     The yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands;
     And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.
     --Palamon and Arcite

The condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently
miserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of
the perfidious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his
captivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the
generality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every
species of subaltern oppression.

Prince John, in league with Philip of France, Coeur-de-Lionâ€™s mortal
enemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria, to
prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood indebted
for so many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his own
faction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession,
in case of the Kingâ€™s death, with the legitimate heir, Arthur Duke of
Brittany, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother of John. This
usurpation, it is well known, he afterwards effected. His own character
being light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily attached to his
person and faction, not only all who had reason to dread the resentment
of Richard for criminal proceedings during his absence, but also the
numerous class of â€œlawless resolutes,â€ whom the crusades had turned back
on their country, accomplished in the vices of the East, impoverished
in substance, and hardened in character, and who placed their hopes
of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of public distress and
apprehension, must be added, the multitude of outlaws, who, driven
to despair by the oppression of the feudal nobility, and the severe
exercise of the forest laws, banded together in large gangs, and,
keeping possession of the forests and the wastes, set at defiance the
justice and magistracy of the country. The nobles themselves, each
fortified within his own castle, and playing the petty sovereign over
his own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less lawless and
oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To maintain these
retainers, and to support the extravagance and magnificence which their
pride induced them to affect, the nobility borrowed sums of money from
the Jews at the most usurious interest, which gnawed into their estates
like consuming cankers, scarce to be cured unless when circumstances
gave them an opportunity of getting free, by exercising upon their
creditors some act of unprincipled violence.

Under the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs,
the people of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet
more dreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a
contagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land; and,
rendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and
the wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept off many whose fate the
survivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils which
were to come.

Yet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich, the
vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which was the
grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved
citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his
family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither duty nor infirmity
could keep youth or age from such exhibitions. The Passage of Arms,
as it was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in the county of
Leicester, as champions of the first renown were to take the field
in the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected to grace the
lists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense confluence of
persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of
combat.

The scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which
approached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive
meadow, of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one
side by the forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees,
some of which had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned
on purpose for the martial display which was intended, sloped gradually
down on all sides to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists
with strong palisades, forming a space of a quarter of a mile in length,
and about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an oblong square,
save that the corners were considerably rounded off, in order to afford
more convenience for the spectators. The openings for the entry of the
combatants were at the northern and southern extremities of the lists,
accessible by strong wooden gates, each wide enough to admit two
horsemen riding abreast. At each of these portals were stationed two
heralds, attended by six trumpets, as many pursuivants, and a strong
body of men-at-arms for maintaining order, and ascertaining the quality
of the knights who proposed to engage in this martial game.

On a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural
elevation of the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions,
adorned with pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the five
knights challengers. The cords of the tents were of the same colour.
Before each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by whom it
was occupied, and beside it stood his squire, quaintly disguised as a
salvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic dress, according to
the taste of his master, and the character he was pleased to assume
during the game. [16]

The central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to Brian
be Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less than
his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of
Arms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the
challengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had
so recently joined them. On one side of his tent were pitched those of
Reginald Front-de-Boeuf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was
the pavilion of Hugh de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity,
whose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the
Conqueror, and his son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St
John of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called
Heather, near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. From the
entrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in breadth,
led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was strongly
secured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in front of the
pavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.

The northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of
thirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed
space for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the
challengers, behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of
every kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other
attendants, in readiness to give their services wherever they might be
necessary.

The exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries,
spread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for the
convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend the
tournament. A narrow space, betwixt these galleries and the lists, gave
accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than
the mere vulgar, and might be compared to the pit of a theatre. The
promiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf
prepared for the purpose, which, aided by the natural elevation of the
ground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view
into the lists. Besides the accommodation which these stations afforded,
many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the trees which
surrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country church, at some
distance, was crowded with spectators.

It only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that
one gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and
consequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat
was to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly
decorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the
royal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen in rich liveries,
waited around this place of honour, which was designed for Prince John
and his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was another, elevated
to the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if
less sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the Prince himself.
A train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be
selected, gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded
a throne decorated in the same colours. Among pennons and flags bearing
wounded hearts, burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers,
and all the commonplace emblems of the triumphs of Cupid, a blazoned
inscription informed the spectators, that this seat of honour was
designed for â€œLa Royne de las Beaulte et des Amoursâ€. But who was to
represent the Queen of Beauty and of Love on the present occasion no one
was prepared to guess.

Meanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy
their respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning
those which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by
the men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes,
and pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to
convince the more refractory. Others, which involved the rival claims
of more elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two
marshals of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who,
armed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve
good order among the spectators.

Gradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their
robes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with
the gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater
proportion than even the men themselves, thronged to witness a sport,
which one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their
sex much pleasure. The lower and interior space was soon filled by
substantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as, from
modesty, poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume any higher place.
It was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes for
precedence occurred.

â€œDog of an unbeliever,â€ said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore
witness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain
intimated his pretensions to rank,--â€œwhelp of a she-wolf! darest
thou press upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of
Montdidier?â€

This rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our acquaintance
Isaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine
ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place
in the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful
Rebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now hanging on her
fatherâ€™s arm, not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which
seemed generally excited by her parentâ€™s presumption. But Isaac, though
we have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions, knew well that
at present he had nothing to fear. It was not in places of general
resort, or where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or
malevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such meetings the Jews
were under the protection of the general law; and if that proved a
weak assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons
assembled some barons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready
to act as their protectors. On the present occasion, Isaac felt more
than usually confident, being aware that Prince John was even then in
the very act of negotiating a large loan from the Jews of York, to
be secured upon certain jewels and lands. Isaacâ€™s own share in this
transaction was considerable, and he well knew that the Princeâ€™s eager
desire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in
the dilemma in which he stood.

Emboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and
jostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent,
quality, or religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited
the indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set
yeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his
belt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length
in his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his
constant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew
darker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth
he had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but
swelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he
kept in a corner, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light.
This intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and
a stern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; and he would have probably
withdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the
attention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of Prince
John, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and
gay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light in
their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions. Among
the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim which a
dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold were not
spared in his garments; and the points of his boots, out-heroding
the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to
be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and
effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. This,
however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant Abbot, who,
perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished
horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex,
dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. The rest
of Prince Johnâ€™s retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his
mercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon
the court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.

It may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were
accounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip
of France in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine
betwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England. It was the
well-known consequence of this discord that Richardâ€™s repeated victories
had been rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege Jerusalem
disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had
dwindled into an uncertain truce with the Sultan Saladin. With the same
policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the Holy
Land, the Templars and Hospitallers in England and Normandy attached
themselves to the faction of Prince John, having little reason to desire
the return of Richard to England, or the succession of Arthur, his
legitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated and
contemned the few Saxon families of consequence which subsisted in
England, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them;
being conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them,
as well as by the greater part of the English commons, who feared
farther innovation upon their rights and liberties, from a sovereign of
Johnâ€™s licentious and tyrannical disposition.

Attended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly
dressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and
having his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of
precious stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread
his shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey,
caracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing
loud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism
the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.

Those who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute
audacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the
feelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of
comeliness which belongs to an open set of features, well formed by
nature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far
frank and honest, that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the
natural workings of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for
manly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference
of a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of
wealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected
with personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they were
the greater number by a hundred to one, the splendour of Prince Johnâ€™s
â€œrhenoâ€, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with the
most costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs, together with
the grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufficient to merit
clamorous applause.

In his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince
was called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the
ambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly.
The quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised the Jew, but was
much more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who,
terrified by the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.

The figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest
beauties of England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a
connoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical,
and was shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore
according to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban
of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The
brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed
aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her
sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted
curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and bosom as a simarre
of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in their natural colours
embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be visible--all these
constituted a combination of loveliness, which yielded not to the most
beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It is true, that of the
golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her vest from the throat
to the waist, the three uppermost were left unfastened on account of
the heat, which somewhat enlarged the prospect to which we allude. A
diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable value, were by this means
also made more conspicuous. The feather of an ostrich, fastened in her
turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of
the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat
above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.

â€œBy the bald scalp of Abraham,â€ said Prince John, â€œyonder Jewess must be
the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest
king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?--By the Temple
of that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable to
recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!â€

â€œThe Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,â€--answered the Prior, in
a sort of snuffling tone; â€œbut your Grace must remember she is still but
a Jewess.â€

â€œAy!â€ added Prince John, without heeding him, â€œand there is my Mammon
of unrighteousness too--the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants,
contesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have
not a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing
there. By the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely
Jewess, shall have a place in the gallery!--What is she, Isaac? Thy wife
or thy daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as
thou wouldst thy treasure-casket?â€

â€œMy daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,â€ answered Isaac, with a
low congee, nothing embarrassed by the Princeâ€™s salutation, in which,
however, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.

â€œThe wiser man thou,â€ said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his
gay followers obsequiously joined. â€œBut, daughter or wife, she should
be preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.--Who sits above
there?â€ he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. â€œSaxon churls,
lolling at their lazy length!--out upon them!--let them sit close, and
make room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter. Iâ€™ll make
the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with
those whom the synagogue properly belongs to.â€

Those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite
speech was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of
his ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on
account of his descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was held
in the highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of England.
But with the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities
had descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance, bulky
and strong in person, and in the flower of his age--yet inanimate in
expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his
motions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his
ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called
Athelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as
Cedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish
temper arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision;
others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his
faculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage
and meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a
character that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all the
valuable parts had flown off in the progress of a long course of brutal
debauchery.

It was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince
addressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca.
Athelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and
feelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to
obey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the â€œvis inertiaeâ€ to
the will of John; and, without stirring or making any motion whatever of
obedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the Prince with
an astonishment which had in it something extremely ludicrous. But the
impatient John regarded it in no such light.

â€œThe Saxon porker,â€ he said, â€œis either asleep or minds me not--Prick
him with your lance, De Bracy,â€ speaking to a knight who rode near him,
the leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of
mercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the time
to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even among the
attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession freed him from
all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated
the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of
the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered presence of mind
sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not Cedric,
as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of
lightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed
the point of the lance from the handle. The blood rushed into the
countenance of Prince John. He swore one of his deepest oaths, and
was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was
diverted from his purpose, partly by his own attendants, who gathered
around him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation
of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of
Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some
safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the
same archer whom we have already noticed, and who seemed to persist
in his gesture of applause, in spite of the frowning aspect which the
Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason for clamouring thus.

â€œI always add my hollo,â€ said the yeoman, â€œwhen I see a good shot, or a
gallant blow.â€

â€œSayst thou?â€ answered the Prince; â€œthen thou canst hit the white
thyself, Iâ€™ll warrant.â€

â€œA woodsmanâ€™s mark, and at woodsmanâ€™s distance, I can hit,â€ answered the
yeoman.

â€œAnd Wat Tyrrelâ€™s mark, at a hundred yards,â€ said a voice from behind,
but by whom uttered could not be discerned.

This allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once
incensed and alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with
commanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on
the braggart, pointing to the yeoman.

â€œBy St Grizzel,â€ he added, â€œwe will try his own skill, who is so ready
to give his voice to the feats of others!â€

â€œI shall not fly the trial,â€ said the yeoman, with the composure which
marked his whole deportment.

â€œMeanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,â€ said the fiery Prince; â€œfor, by
the light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have his seat
amongst ye!â€

â€œBy no means, an it please your Grace!--it is not fit for such as we
to sit with the rulers of the land,â€ said the Jew; whose ambition for
precedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated
and impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means
stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy
Saxons.

â€œUp, infidel dog when I command you,â€ said Prince John, â€œor I will have
thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.â€

Thus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led
up to the gallery.

â€œLet me see,â€ said the Prince, â€œwho dare stop him,â€ fixing his eye on
Cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jew down
headlong.

The catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing
betwixt his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Princeâ€™s
defiance, â€œMarry, that will I!â€ opposed to the beard of the Jew a shield
of brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which,
doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have
proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. Finding the
abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the Jester,
at the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his head, the Jew
recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,--an excellent
jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which Prince John
and his attendants heartily joined.

â€œDeal me the prize, cousin Prince,â€ said Wamba; â€œI have vanquished my
foe in fair fight with sword and shield,â€ he added, brandishing the
brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.

â€œWho, and what art thou, noble champion?â€ said Prince John, still
laughing.

â€œA fool by right of descent,â€ answered the Jester; â€œI am Wamba, the
son of Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of an
Alderman.â€

â€œMake room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,â€ said Prince John,
not unwilling perhaps to, seize an apology to desist from his original
purpose; â€œto place the vanquished beside the victor were false
heraldry.â€

â€œKnave upon fool were worse,â€ answered the Jester, â€œand Jew upon bacon
worst of all.â€

â€œGramercy! good fellow,â€ cried Prince John, â€œthou pleasest me--Here,
Isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.â€

As the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling
to comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and
was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a
handful, the Prince stooped from his jennet and settled Isaacâ€™s doubts
by snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a
couple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career
round the lists, leaving the Jew to the derision of those around him,
and himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had
done some honest and honourable action.




CHAPTER VIII

     At this the challenger with fierce defy
     His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:
     With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.
     Their visors closed, their lances in the rest,
     Or at the helmet pointed or the crest,

In the midst of Prince Johnâ€™s cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and
appealing to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of
the day had been forgotten.

â€œBy my halidom,â€ said he, â€œwe have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the
fair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is to
be distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care not if
I give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.â€

â€œHoly Virgin,â€ answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, â€œa
Jewess!--We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I am not
yet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint, that
she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.â€

â€œSaxon or Jew,â€ answered the Prince, â€œSaxon or Jew, dog or hog, what
matters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon
churls.â€

A murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.

â€œThis passes a jest, my lord,â€ said De Bracy; â€œno knight here will lay
lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.â€

â€œIt is the mere wantonness of insult,â€ said one of the oldest and most
important of Prince Johnâ€™s followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, â€œand if your
Grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.â€

â€œI entertained you, sir,â€ said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily,
â€œfor my follower, but not for my counsellor.â€

â€œThose who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,â€ said
Waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, â€œacquire the right of
counsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than
their own.â€

From the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of
acquiescence â€œI did but jest,â€ he said; â€œand you turn upon me like
so many adders! Name whom you will, in the fiendâ€™s name, and please
yourselves.â€

â€œNay, nay,â€ said De Bracy, â€œlet the fair sovereignâ€™s throne remain
unoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him choose
the lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his
triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who
can exalt them to such distinction.â€

â€œIf Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,â€ said the Prior, â€œI will gage
my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty.â€

â€œBois-Guilbert,â€ answered De Bracy, â€œis a good lance; but there are
others around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter
him.â€

â€œSilence, sirs,â€ said Waldemar, â€œand let the Prince assume his seat.
The knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and
highly fit it is that the sports should commence.â€

Prince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the
inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,
must always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however,
although his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be
obstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded
by his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the
tournament, which were briefly as follows:

First, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.

Secondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select
a special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his shield.
If he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill was made
with what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with lances at
whose extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed, so that no danger
was encountered, save from the shock of the horses and riders. But if
the shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance, the combat was
understood to be at â€œoutranceâ€, that is, the knights were to fight with
sharp weapons, as in actual battle.

Thirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each of
them breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in the
first dayâ€™s tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of exquisite
beauty and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour,
it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the
Queen of Love and Beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the
ensuing day.

Fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a
general tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous
to win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of
equal numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given
by Prince John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and Beauty
was then to crown the knight whom the Prince should adjudge to have
borne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin
gold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. On this second day
the knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow, feats of
archery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be
practised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this
manner did Prince John endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity,
which he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of
wanton aggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people.

The lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping galleries
were crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and beautiful
in the northern and midland parts of England; and the contrast of the
various dresses of these dignified spectators, rendered the view as
gay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space, filled with the
substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England, formed, in their more
plain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around this circle of brilliant
embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time, setting off its splendour.

The heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of
â€œLargesse, largesse, gallant knights!â€ and gold and silver pieces were
showered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry
to exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the
secretaries and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators
was acknowledged by the customary shouts of â€œLove of Ladies--Death of
Champions--Honour to the Generous--Glory to the Brave!â€ To which the
more humble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band of
trumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds
had ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering
procession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the
field, who, armed cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues,
at the opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the
northern extremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely
crowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the
challengers, and, when viewed from the galleries, presented the
appearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening
helmets, and tall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many
cases, attached small pennons of about a spanâ€™s breadth, which,
fluttering in the air as the breeze caught them, joined with the
restless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene.

At length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot,
advanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and
the other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my
Saxon authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at great length
their devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse
trappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. To
borrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but too little:

     â€œThe knights are dust,
     And their good swords are rust,
     Their souls are with the saints, we trust.â€ [17]

Their escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles.
Their castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins--the
place that once knew them, knows them no more--nay, many a race since
theirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they
occupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal
lords. What, then, would it avail the reader to know their names, or the
evanescent symbols of their martial rank!

Now, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their
names and feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining
their fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the
same time, they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and
dexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the
sound of a wild Barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the
challengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern
origin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the
cymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the
knights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of
spectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform
upon which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating
themselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance,
the shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The
lower orders of spectators in general--nay, many of the higher class,
and it is even said several of the ladies, were rather disappointed
at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For the same sort
of persons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the deepest
tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to
the danger incurred by the champions engaged.

Having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated
to the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line;
while the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their
horses, and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the
platform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had
touched their respective shields.

At the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against
each other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or
good fortune of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert,
Malvoisin, and Front-de-Boeuf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of
Grantmesnil, instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest
or the shield of his enemy, swerved so much from the direct line as
to break the weapon athwart the person of his opponent--a circumstance
which was accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually
unhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident, whereas the
former evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of
the horse. The fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party,
and parted fairly with the Knight of St John, both splintering their
lances without advantage on either side.

The shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the
heralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the
victors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to
their pavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could,
withdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their
victors concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses, which,
according to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The fifth
of their number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be greeted
by the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated, to the
aggravation, doubtless, of his companionsâ€™ mortification.

A second and a third party of knights took the field; and although
they had various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly
remained with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or
swerved from his charge--misfortunes which befell one or two of their
antagonists in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed
to them, seemed to be considerably damped by their continued success.
Three knights only appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the
shields of Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-Boeuf, contented themselves
with touching those of the three other knights, who had not altogether
manifested the same strength and dexterity. This politic selection
did not alter the fortune of the field, the challengers were still
successful: one of their antagonists was overthrown, and both the others
failed in the â€œattaintâ€, [18] that is, in striking the helmet and shield
of their antagonist firmly and strongly, with the lance held in a direct
line, so that the weapon might break unless the champion was overthrown.

After this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did
it appear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest.
The spectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers,
Malvoisin and Front-de-Boeuf were unpopular from their characters,
and the others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and
foreigners.

But none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as
Cedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman
challengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own
education had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry, although,
with the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on
many occasions, a brave and determined soldier. He looked anxiously
to Athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if
desiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory
which was passing into the hands of the Templar and his associates.
But, though both stout of heart, and strong of person, Athelstane had a
disposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which Cedric
seemed to expect from him.

â€œThe day is against England, my lord,â€ said Cedric, in a marked tone;
â€œare you not tempted to take the lance?â€

â€œI shall tilt to-morrowâ€ answered Athelstane, â€œin the â€˜meleeâ€™; it is not
worth while for me to arm myself to-day.â€

Two things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman
word â€œmeleeâ€, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced
some indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by
Athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not
trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had
no time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing, â€œIt
was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred,
than the best man of two.â€

Athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric,
who better understood the Jesterâ€™s meaning, darted at him a severe and
menacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and
place prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service,
more sensible marks of his masterâ€™s resentment.

The pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by
the voices of the heralds exclaiming--â€œLove of ladies, splintering of
lances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!â€

The music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts
expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday
which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles
lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs
of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames
of such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times.
Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making ready
the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and
foiled a third.

At length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of
those long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of
the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note
of defiance from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to see
the new champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were the
barriers opened than he paced into the lists. As far as could be judged
of a man sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly exceed
the middle size, and seemed to be rather slender than strongly made.
His suit of armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold, and the
device on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled up by the roots, with
the Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He was mounted on
a gallant black horse, and as he passed through the lists he gracefully
saluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his lance. The dexterity
with which he managed his steed, and something of youthful grace which
he displayed in his manner, won him the favour of the multitude, which
some of the lower classes expressed by calling out, â€œTouch Ralph de
Vipontâ€™s shield--touch the Hospitallers shield; he has the least sure
seat, he is your cheapest bargain.â€

The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the
platform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and,
to the astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central
pavilion, struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian
de Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his
presumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus
defied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge,
was standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.

â€œHave you confessed yourself, brother,â€ said the Templar, â€œand have you
heard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?â€

â€œI am fitter to meet death than thou artâ€ answered the Disinherited
Knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books
of the tourney.

â€œThen take your place in the lists,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œand look your
last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.â€

â€œGramercy for thy courtesy,â€ replied the Disinherited Knight, â€œand to
requite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by
my honour you will need both.â€

Having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward
down the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same
manner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the
northern extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his
antagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of
the multitude.

However incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he
recommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for
his honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means
which might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed
his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He
chose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have
been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly,
he laid aside his shield, which had received some little damage, and
received another from his squires. His first had only borne the general
device of his rider, representing two knights riding upon one horse, an
emblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars,
qualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth
that finally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbertâ€™s new shield
bore a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing
the motto, â€œGare le Corbeauâ€.

When the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two
extremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the
highest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could
terminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and
gallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.

The trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished
from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre
of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances burst into
shivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both
knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards
upon its haunches. The address of the riders recovered their steeds
by use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on each other for an
instant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the bars of their
visors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of the
lists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.

A loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs,
and general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators
in this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which
had graced the day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their station,
than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so
dead, that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe.

A few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their
horses might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to
the trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung from
their stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same
speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal
fortune as before.

In this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his
antagonistâ€™s shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear
went to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle.
On the other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career,
directed the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbertâ€™s shield, but,
changing his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it
to the helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,
rendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit the Norman on
the visor, where his lanceâ€™s point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even at
this disadvantage, the Templar sustained his high reputation; and had
not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. As
it chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground under
a cloud of dust.

To extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the
Templar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at
his disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the
spectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror.
The Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his
sword. The marshals of the field, however, spurred their horses between
them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the
present occasion, permit this species of encounter.

â€œWe shall meet again, I trust,â€ said the Templar, casting a resentful
glance at his antagonist; â€œand where there are none to separate us.â€

â€œIf we do not,â€ said the Disinherited Knight, â€œthe fault shall not be
mine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I am
alike ready to encounter thee.â€

More and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals,
crossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The
Disinherited Knight returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert
to his tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of
despair.

Without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of
wine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced
that he quaffed it, â€œTo all true English hearts, and to the confusion of
foreign tyrants.â€ He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance
to the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he
should make no election, but was willing to encounter them in the order
in which they pleased to advance against him.

The gigantic Front-de-Boeuf, armed in sable armour, was the first who
took the field. He bore on a white shield a black bullâ€™s head, half
defaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing
the arrogant motto, â€œCave, Adsumâ€. Over this champion the Disinherited
Knight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke
their lances fairly, but Front-de-Boeuf, who lost a stirrup in the
encounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.

In the strangerâ€™s third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was
equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that
the laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling by
being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.

In his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight showed
as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. De
Grantmesnilâ€™s horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged
in the course of the career so as to disturb the riderâ€™s aim, and the
stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded
him, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching
him, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists,
offering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounter.
This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself vanquished as much by the
courtesy as by the address of his opponent.

Ralph de Vipont summed up the list of the strangerâ€™s triumphs, being
hurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his
nose and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.

The acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the
Prince and marshals, announcing that dayâ€™s honours to the Disinherited
Knight.




CHAPTER IX

     ----In the midst was seen
     A lady of a more majestic mien,
     By stature and by beauty markâ€™d their sovereign Queen.
     * * * * *
     And as in beauty she surpassâ€™d the choir,
     So nobler than the rest was her attire;
     A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,
     Plain without pomp, and rich without a show;
     A branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,
     She bore aloft her symbol of command.
     The Flower and the Leaf

William de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field,
were the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying
him, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least,
that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive
the prize of the dayâ€™s tourney from the hands of Prince John. The
Disinherited Knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their request,
alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for
reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists.
The marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for amidst the
frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind
themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than
those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space, or
until some particular adventure was achieved. The marshals, therefore,
pressed no farther into the mystery of the Disinherited Knight, but,
announcing to Prince John the conquerorâ€™s desire to remain unknown, they
requested permission to bring him before his Grace, in order that he
might receive the reward of his valour.

Johnâ€™s curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;
and, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which
the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one
knight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, â€œBy the light of Our
Ladyâ€™s brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his
courtesy as of his lands, since he desires to appear before us without
uncovering his face.--Wot ye, my lords,â€ he said, turning round to his
train, â€œwho this gallant can be, that bears himself thus proudly?â€

â€œI cannot guess,â€ answered De Bracy, â€œnor did I think there had been
within the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down
these five knights in one dayâ€™s jousting. By my faith, I shall never
forget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller
was hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.â€

â€œBoast not of that,â€ said a Knight of St John, who was present;
â€œyour Temple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance,
Bois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at
every turn.â€

De Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was
prevented by Prince John. â€œSilence, sirs!â€ he said; â€œwhat unprofitable
debate have we here?â€

â€œThe victor,â€ said De Wyvil, â€œstill waits the pleasure of your
highness.â€

â€œIt is our pleasure,â€ answered John, â€œthat he do so wait until we learn
whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and
quality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough
to keep him warm.â€

â€œYour Grace,â€ said Waldemar Fitzurse, â€œwill do less than due honour to
the victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that
which we cannot know; at least I can form no guess--unless he be one of
the good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are
now straggling homeward from the Holy Land.â€

â€œIt may be the Earl of Salisbury,â€ said De Bracy; â€œhe is about the same
pitch.â€

â€œSir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,â€ said Fitzurse;
â€œSalisbury is bigger in the bones.â€ A whisper arose among the train,
but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. â€œIt might be the
King--it might be Richard Coeur-de-Lion himself!â€

â€œOver Godâ€™s forbode!â€ said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the
same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of
lightning; â€œWaldemar!--De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember
your promises, and stand truly by me!â€

â€œHere is no danger impending,â€ said Waldemar Fitzurse; â€œare you so
little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your fatherâ€™s son, as
to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit
of armour?--De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by
bringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has
conjured all the blood from his cheeks.--Look at him more closely,â€ he
continued, â€œyour highness will see that he wants three inches of King
Richardâ€™s height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very
horse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King
Richard through a single course.â€

While he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the Disinherited
Knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent
from the lists to Prince Johnâ€™s throne. Still discomposed with the idea
that his brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted,
had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions
pointed out by Fitzurse did not altogether remove the Princeâ€™s
apprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his
valour, he caused to be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the
prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before
him, an answer might be returned, in the deep and awful accents of
Richard the Lion-hearted.

But the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment
of the Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.

The horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the
animal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture;
which, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the
eyes of those who were judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of the
saddle, the Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of the
steed without making use of the stirrup, and, brandishing aloft his
lance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of
the horse with the skill of a perfect horseman.

The appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to
this display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the
best advantage the princely reward with which he had been just honoured,
and the Knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all present.

In the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince
John, in a whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment,
instead of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced
the galleries a lady, who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty
and of Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day.
The Prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the Knight
passed him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned
towards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within
a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting Johnâ€™s
commands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly
reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high
excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.

â€œSir Disinherited Knight,â€ said Prince John, â€œsince that is the only
title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as
privilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love,
is to preside over next dayâ€™s festival. If, as a stranger in our land,
you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we
can only say that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar
Fitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in
place. Nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom
you please this crown, by the delivery of which to the lady of
your choice, the election of to-morrowâ€™s Queen will be formal and
complete.--Raise your lance.â€

The Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of
green satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge
of which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably,
like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.

In the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar
Fitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,
which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low
artifice and cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry
around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the Jewess
Rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating Aliciaâ€™s father Waldemar,
of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself
dissatisfied during the course of the dayâ€™s proceedings. He had also a
wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for John was
at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition.
But besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against
the Disinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong
dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse, who was
likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in
case, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.

And so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery
close to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the
full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he
had hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his
right of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid
circle.

It was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who
underwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some
blushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight
forward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on,
some drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured to
forbear smiling, and there were two or three who laughed outright. There
were also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as the
Wardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing, it
may be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they
were willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to
the rising beauties of the age.

At length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady
Rowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to
the utmost.

It must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could
have bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which
he paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at
the discomfiture of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of
his two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, had, with
his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each
course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. The
Lady Rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
though without openly betraying the same intense interest. Even the
unmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health
of the Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under the gallery
occupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the
day.

â€œFather Abraham!â€ said Isaac of York, when the first course was run
betwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, â€œhow fiercely that
Gentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way
from Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild assâ€™s
colt--and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph
Pareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of
profits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the
highways!â€

â€œIf he risks his own person and limbs, father,â€ said Rebecca, â€œin doing
such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and
armour.â€

â€œChild!â€ replied Isaac, somewhat heated, â€œthou knowest not what thou
speakest--His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour
belong to--Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!--Nevertheless, it is
a good youth--See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to battle
against the Philistine--Pray, child--pray for the safety of the good
youth,--and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.--God of my
fathers!â€ he again exclaimed, â€œhe hath conquered, and the uncircumcised
Philistine hath fallen before his lance,--even as Og the King of
Bashan, and Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our
fathers!--Surely he shall take their gold and their silver, and their
war-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for a
spoil.â€

The same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that was
run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value
of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each
new success. There had been therefore no small interest taken in the
success of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part of
the lists before which he now paused.

Whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the
champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while
the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then,
gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited
the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair Rowena. The
trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the Lady Rowena
the Queen of Beauty and of Love for the ensuing day, menacing with
suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority.
They then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric, in the height
of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which Athelstane,
though less promptly, added one equally large.

There was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were
as much unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the
Norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they
themselves had introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were drowned
by the popular shout of â€œLong live the Lady Rowena, the chosen and
lawful Queen of Love and of Beauty!â€ To which many in the lower area
added, â€œLong live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the immortal
Alfred!â€

However unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to
those around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the
nomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left
his throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again
entered the lists. The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of
the Lady Alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the same
time, to those around him--â€œBy my halidome, sirs! if the Knightâ€™s feats
in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath no
less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest.â€

It was on this occasion, as during his whole life, Johnâ€™s misfortune,
not perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to
conciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the
Prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been
slighted.

â€œI know no right of chivalry,â€ he said, â€œmore precious or inalienable
than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own
judgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own
character, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full
proportion of that which is her due.â€

Prince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent
to his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where
Rowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.

â€œAssume,â€ he said, â€œfair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which
none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if
it please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our
banquet in the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to
whose service we devote to-morrow.â€

Rowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native Saxon.

â€œThe Lady Rowena,â€ he said, â€œpossesses not the language in which to
reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I also,
and the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the language, and
practise only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore decline with
thanks your Highnessâ€™s courteous invitation to the banquet. To-morrow,
the Lady Rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been
called by the free election of the victor Knight, confirmed by the
acclamations of the people.â€

So saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowenaâ€™s head, in
token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.

â€œWhat says he?â€ said Prince John, affecting not to understand the
Saxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of
Cedricâ€™s speech was repeated to him in French. â€œIt is well,â€ he said;
â€œto-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of
dignity.--You, at least, Sir Knight,â€ he added, turning to the victor,
who had remained near the gallery, â€œwill this day share our banquet?â€

The Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice,
excused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for
to-morrowâ€™s encounter.

â€œIt is well,â€ said Prince John, haughtily; â€œalthough unused to such
refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though
ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of
Beauty.â€

So saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and
his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking
up and dispersion of the spectators.

Yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially
when combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded
three paces, ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern
resentment upon the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of
the day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near--â€œOn
your life, suffer not that fellow to escape.â€

The yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried
steadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile,
â€œI have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after to-morrow--I
must see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw their bows--the
forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good archers.â€

â€œI,â€ said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply,--â€œI
will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill
should prove some apology for his insolence!â€

â€œIt is full time,â€ said De Bracy, â€œthat the â€˜outrecuidanceâ€™ [19] of
these peasants should be restrained by some striking example.â€

Waldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the
readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.
Prince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of
the multitude became general.

In various routes, according to the different quarters from which
they came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen
retiring over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards
the town of Ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged
in the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself.
Among these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the
tournament, or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as
they rode slowly along, talking over the events of the day, were greeted
with loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were bestowed
upon Prince John, although he was indebted for them rather to the
splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his
character.

A more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited
acclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw
himself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of
those pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of
which was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field. On his
retiring to his tent, many who had lingered in the lists, to look upon
and form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.

The signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded
together in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were now
exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups retreating
in all directions, and these speedily died away in silence. No other
sounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped the
galleries of their cushions and tapestry, in order to put them in safety
for the night, and wrangled among themselves for the half-used bottles
of wine and relics of the refreshment which had been served round to the
spectators.

Beyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and
these now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of
the armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order
to repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.

A strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to
two hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.




CHAPTER X

     Thus, like the sad presaging raven, that tolls
     The sick manâ€™s passport in her hollow beak,
     And in the shadow of the silent night
     Doth shake contagion from her sable wings;
     Vexâ€™d and tormented, runs poor Barrabas,
     With fatal curses towards these Christians.
     --Jew of Malta

The Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires
and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring
fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. Their zeal
on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one
desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet
had refused, even at the command of Prince John, to lift his visor or
to name his name. But their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified.
The Disinherited Knight refused all other assistance save that of his
own squire, or rather yeoman--a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a
cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and face half-buried
in a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito
as much as his master. All others being excluded from the tent, this
attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his
armour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the
day rendered very acceptable.

The Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced
to him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with
him. The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe
usually worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished with a
hood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the
wearer, almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the
twilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered
a disguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an
individual chanced to be particularly well known.

The Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of
his tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom
he easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led
his masterâ€™s charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day
fought.

â€œAccording to the laws of chivalry,â€ said the foremost of these men, â€œI,
Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the Disinherited
Knight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian de Bois-Guilbert
in this dayâ€™s Passage of Arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain
or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law
of arms.â€

The other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to
await the decision of the Disinherited Knight.

â€œTo you four, sirs,â€ replied the Knight, addressing those who had last
spoken, â€œand to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one common
reply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should
do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by
braver cavaliers.--I would I could here end my message to these
gallant knights; but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the
Disinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will,
of their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since
that which I wear I can hardly term mine own.â€

â€œWe stand commissioned, each of us,â€ answered the squire of Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf, â€œto offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses
and suits of armour.â€

â€œIt is sufficient,â€ said the Disinherited Knight. â€œHalf the sum
my present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,
distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the
other half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and
attendants.â€

The squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep
sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a
scale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his discourse
to Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. â€œFrom your master,â€
 said he, â€œI will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in my name,
that our strife is not ended--no, not till we have fought as well with
swords as with lances--as well on foot as on horseback. To this
mortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and I shall not forget the
challenge.--Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one of
his companions, with whom I can with pleasure exchange courtesies; but
rather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal defiance.â€

â€œMy master,â€ answered Baldwin, â€œknows how to requite scorn with scorn,
and blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you
disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have
rated the arms of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his
horse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one
nor wear the other.â€

â€œYou have spoken well, good squire,â€ said the Disinherited Knight,
â€œwell and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent
master. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore them to
thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend,
for thine own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon you
freely.â€

Baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the
Disinherited Knight entered the pavilion.

â€œThus far, Gurth,â€ said he, addressing his attendant, â€œthe reputation of
English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ said Gurth, â€œfor a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the
personage of a Norman squire-at-arms.â€

â€œYea, but,â€ answered the Disinherited Knight, â€œthou hast ever kept me in
anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.â€

â€œTush!â€ said Gurth, â€œI fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,
Wamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were most
knave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master
passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his
porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I
am discovered---â€

â€œEnough,â€ said the Disinherited Knight, â€œthou knowest my promise.â€

â€œNay, for that matter,â€ said Gurth, â€œI will never fail my friend for
fear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife or
scourge as well as any boarâ€™s hide in my herd.â€

â€œTrust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,â€ said the
Knight. â€œMeanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold.â€

â€œI am richer,â€ said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, â€œthan ever was
swineherd or bondsman.â€

â€œTake this bag of gold to Ashby,â€ continued his master, â€œand find out
Isaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms
with which his credit supplied me.â€

â€œNay, by St Dunstan,â€ replied Gurth, â€œthat I will not do.â€

â€œHow, knave,â€ replied his master, â€œwilt thou not obey my commands?â€

â€œSo they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,â€ replied Gurth;
â€œbut this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would be
dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it
were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a
believer to enrich an infidel.â€

â€œSee him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,â€ said the
Disinherited Knight.

â€œI will do so,â€ said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving
the apartment; â€œand it will go hard,â€ he muttered, â€œbut I content him
with one-half of his own asking.â€ So saying, he departed, and left the
Disinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more
accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a
nature peculiarly agitating and painful.

We must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a
country house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with
whom Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the
Jews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of
hospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to
be reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they
termed Gentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little
hospitality at their hand.

In an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of
an Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions,
which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served,
like the estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. She
was watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and
filial affection, while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien
and disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together--sometimes
casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under
great mental tribulation. â€œO, Jacob!â€ he exclaimed--â€œO, all ye twelve
Holy Fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who
hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of Moses--Fifty zecchins
wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!â€

â€œBut, father,â€ said Rebecca, â€œyou seemed to give the gold to Prince John
willingly.â€

â€œWillingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!--Willingly, saidst thou?--Ay,
as willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise
to lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest--robed the
seething billows in my choice silks--perfumed their briny foam with
myrrh and aloes--enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And
was not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made the
sacrifice?â€

â€œBut it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives,â€
 answered Rebecca, â€œand the God of our fathers has since blessed your
store and your gettings.â€

â€œAy,â€ answered Isaac, â€œbut if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did
to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?--O, daughter,
disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our
race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs
around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to
smile tamely, when we would revenge bravely.â€

â€œThink not thus of it, my father,â€ said Rebecca; â€œwe also have
advantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in
some sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they despise
and persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish
forth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold
which we lend them returns with increase to our coffers. We are like the
herb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. Even this dayâ€™s
pageant had not proceeded without the consent of the despised Jew, who
furnished the means.â€

â€œDaughter,â€ said Isaac, â€œthou hast harped upon another string of sorrow.
The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my
adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester--there is a dead loss
too--ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the space
between two Sabbaths--and yet it may end better than I now think, for
â€˜tis a good youth.â€

â€œAssuredly,â€ said Rebecca, â€œyou shall not repent you of requiting the
good deed received of the stranger knight.â€

â€œI trust so, daughter,â€ said Isaac, â€œand I trust too in the rebuilding
of Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls
and battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very
best of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the
judge and jailor.â€

So saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and
Rebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to
awaken new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing
efforts--a prudential line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set
up for comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.

The evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the
apartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with perfumed
oil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments, were at the
same time displayed by another Israelitish domestic on a small ebony
table, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their houses, the
Jews refused themselves no expensive indulgences. At the same time the
servant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed Christians,
while conversing among themselves) desired to speak with him. He that
would live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of every one
claiming business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the table the
untasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and
saying hastily to his daughter, â€œRebecca, veil thyself,â€ commanded the
stranger to be admitted.

Just as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver
gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered,
wrapt in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was rather
suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his
bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.

â€œArt thou Isaac the Jew of York?â€ said Gurth, in Saxon.

â€œI am,â€ replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had
rendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)--â€œand who art
thou?â€

â€œThat is not to the purpose,â€ answered Gurth.

â€œAs much as my name is to thee,â€ replied Isaac; â€œfor without knowing
thine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?â€

â€œEasily,â€ answered Gurth; â€œI, being to pay money, must know that I
deliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, I
think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.â€

â€œO,â€ said the Jew, â€œyou are come to pay moneys?--Holy Father Abraham!
that altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost thou bring
it?â€

â€œFrom the Disinherited Knight,â€ said Gurth, â€œvictor in this dayâ€™s
tournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by Kirjath
Jairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to thy
stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay for the
armour.â€

â€œI said he was a good youth!â€ exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation. â€œA
cup of wine will do thee no harm,â€ he added, filling and handing to the
swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. â€œAnd how
much money,â€ continued Isaac, â€œhas thou brought with thee?â€

â€œHoly Virgin!â€ said Gurth, setting down the cup, â€œwhat nectar these
unbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as
muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!--What money have I
brought with me?â€ continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil
ejaculation, â€œeven but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What,
Isaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one.â€

â€œNay, but,â€ said Isaac, â€œthy master has won goodly steeds and rich
armours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand--but â€˜tis
a good youth--the Jew will take these in present payment, and render him
back the surplus.â€

â€œMy master has disposed of them already,â€ said Gurth.

â€œAh! that was wrong,â€ said the Jew, â€œthat was the part of a fool. No
Christians here could buy so many horses and armour--no Jew except
myself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins
with thee in that bag,â€ said Isaac, prying under Gurthâ€™s cloak, â€œit is a
heavy one.â€

â€œI have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,â€ said Gurth, readily.

â€œWell, thenâ€--said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love
of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance, â€œif
I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and
the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilderâ€™s profit, have you money
to pay me?â€

â€œBarely,â€ said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than
he expected, â€œand it will leave my master nigh penniless. Nevertheless,
if such be your least offer, I must be content.â€

â€œFill thyself another goblet of wine,â€ said the Jew. â€œAh! eighty
zecchins is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the
moneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this
dayâ€™s encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed
rushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot but
have had wrong.â€

â€œAnd I say,â€ replied Gurth, â€œhe is sound, wind and limb; and you may
see him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy
zecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christianâ€™s word is as
good as a Jewâ€™s. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this bagâ€
 (and he shook it till the contents jingled) â€œback to my master.â€

â€œNay, nay!â€ said Isaac; â€œlay down the talents--the shekels--the eighty
zecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally.â€

Gurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the
table, the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and
suit of armour. The Jewâ€™s hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the
first seventy pieces of gold. The last ten he told over with much
deliberation, pausing, and saying something as he took each piece from
the table, and dropt it into his purse. It seemed as if his avarice were
struggling with his better nature, and compelling him to pouch zecchin
after zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore some part at
least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His whole speech
ran nearly thus:

â€œSeventy-one--seventy-two; thy master is a good youth--seventy-three,
an excellent youth--seventy-four--that piece hath been clipt
within the ring--seventy-five--and that looketh light of
weight--seventy-six--when thy master wants money, let him come to Isaac
of York--seventy-seven--that is, with reasonable security.â€ Here he made
a considerable pause, and Gurth had good hope that the last three pieces
might escape the fate of their comrades; but the enumeration
proceeded.--â€œSeventy-eight--thou art a good fellow--seventy-nine--and
deservest something for thyself---â€

Here the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,
doubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his
finger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too
flat, or had it felt a hairâ€™s breadth too light, generosity had carried
the day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the
zecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not
find in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in
absence of mind, with the words, â€œEighty completes the tale, and I trust
thy master will reward thee handsomely.--Surely,â€ he added, looking
earnestly at the bag, â€œthou hast more coins in that pouch?â€

Gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,
â€œAbout the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully.â€
 He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,--â€œPeril
of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!â€ He filled himself
unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without
ceremony.

â€œRebecca,â€ said the Jew, â€œthat Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.
Nevertheless his master is a good youth--ay, and I am well pleased that
he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed
of his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of
Goliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaverâ€™s beam.â€

As he turned to receive Rebeccaâ€™s answer, he observed, that during his
chattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.

In the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the
dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance,
when a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in
her hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. Gurth had some reluctance
to obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only
earthly force was to be apprehended, he had all the characteristic
terrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends, white women, and
the whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had brought with them
from the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover, that he was in the
house of a Jew, a people who, besides the other unamiable qualities
which popular report ascribed to them, were supposed to be profound
necromancers and cabalists. Nevertheless, after a momentâ€™s pause, he
obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition, and followed her into
the apartment which she indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise
that his fair guide was the beautiful Jewess whom he had seen at the
tournament, and a short time in her fatherâ€™s apartment.

She asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he
detailed accurately.

â€œMy father did but jest with thee, good fellow,â€ said Rebecca; â€œhe owes
thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were
their value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?â€

â€œEighty zecchins,â€ said Gurth, surprised at the question.

â€œIn this purse,â€ said Rebecca, â€œthou wilt find a hundred. Restore to
thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder.
Haste--begone--stay not to render thanks! and beware how you pass
through this crowded town, where thou mayst easily lose both thy burden
and thy life.--Reuben,â€ she added, clapping her hands together, â€œlight
forth this stranger, and fail not to draw lock and bar behind him.â€
 Reuben, a dark-browâ€™d and black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her summons,
with a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the house, and
conducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket in
the entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains
as would well have become that of a prison.

â€œBy St Dunstan,â€ said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, â€œthis
is no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave young
master--twenty from this pearl of Zion--Oh, happy day!--Such another,
Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as free of thy
guild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherdâ€™s horn and staff,
and take the freemanâ€™s sword and buckler, and follow my young master to
the death, without hiding either my face or my name.â€




CHAPTER XI

     1st Outlaw: Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;
     If not, weâ€™ll make you sit, and rifle you.
     Speed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villains
     That all the travellers do fear so much.
     Val: My friends,--
     1st Out: Thatâ€™s not so, sir, we are your enemies.
     2d Out: Peace! weâ€™ll hear him.
     3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we;
     For heâ€™s a proper man.
     --Two Gentlemen of Verona

The nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he
himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two
straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found
himself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel
and holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether
across the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the
carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to
the tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted
the light of the harvest moon.

From the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed
occasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and
sometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds, intimating
the disorderly state of the town, crowded with military nobles and
their dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. â€œThe Jewess was
right,â€ he said to himself. â€œBy heaven and St Dunstan, I would I were
safe at my journeyâ€™s end with all this treasure! Here are such numbers,
I will not say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights and errant
squires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant
jesters, that a man with a single merk would be in danger, much more a
poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. Would I were out of
the shade of these infernal bushes, that I might at least see any of St
Nicholasâ€™s clerks before they spring on my shoulders.â€

Gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common
to which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his
object. Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the
underwood was thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears
anticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast,
that resistance, if at first practicable, would have been now too
late.--â€œSurrender your charge,â€ said one of them; â€œwe are the deliverers
of the commonwealth, who ease every man of his burden.â€

â€œYou should not ease me of mine so lightly,â€ muttered Gurth, whose
surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate
violence,--â€œhad I it but in my power to give three strokes in its
defence.â€

â€œWe shall see that presently,â€ said the robber; and, speaking to his
companions, he added, â€œbring along the knave. I see he would have his
head broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins
at once.â€

Gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been
dragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the
lane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and
the open common. He was compelled to follow his rough conductors into
the very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an
irregular open space, free in a great measure from trees, and on which,
therefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from
boughs and leaves. Here his captors were joined by two other persons,
apparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their sides,
and quarter-staves in their hands, and Gurth could now observe that
all six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no
question, even had their former proceedings left it in doubt.

â€œWhat money hast thou, churl?â€ said one of the thieves.

â€œThirty zecchins of my own property,â€ answered Gurth, doggedly.

â€œA forfeit--a forfeit,â€ shouted the robbers; â€œa Saxon hath thirty
zecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and
unredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.â€

â€œI hoarded it to purchase my freedom,â€ said Gurth.

â€œThou art an ass,â€ replied one of the thieves â€œthree quarts of double
ale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he be
a Saxon like thyself.â€

â€œA sad truth,â€ replied Gurth; â€œbut if these same thirty zecchins will
buy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to you.â€

â€œHold,â€ said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others;
â€œthis bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak, contains
more coin than thou hast told us of.â€

â€œIt is the good knight my masterâ€™s,â€ answered Gurth, â€œof which,
assuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with
working your will upon mine own property.â€

â€œThou art an honest fellow,â€ replied the robber, â€œI warrant thee; and we
worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet
escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy trust
for a time.â€ So saying, he took from Gurthâ€™s breast the large leathern
pouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed, as well as
the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.--â€œWho is
thy master?â€

â€œThe Disinherited Knight,â€ said Gurth.

â€œWhose good lance,â€ replied the robber, â€œwon the prize in to-dayâ€™s
tourney? What is his name and lineage?â€

â€œIt is his pleasure,â€ answered Gurth, â€œthat they be concealed; and from
me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.â€

â€œWhat is thine own name and lineage?â€

â€œTo tell that,â€ said Gurth, â€œmight reveal my masterâ€™s.â€

â€œThou art a saucy groom,â€ said the robber, â€œbut of that anon. How comes
thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means hath
it accrued to him?â€

â€œBy his good lance,â€ answered Gurth.--â€œThese bags contain the ransom of
four good horses, and four good suits of armour.â€

â€œHow much is there?â€ demanded the robber.

â€œTwo hundred zecchins.â€

â€œOnly two hundred zecchins!â€ said the bandit; â€œyour master hath dealt
liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name those
who paid the gold.â€

Gurth did so.

â€œThe armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what
ransom were they held?--Thou seest thou canst not deceive me.â€

â€œMy master,â€ replied Gurth, â€œwill take nought from the Templar save
his lifeâ€™s-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold
courteous intercourse together.â€

â€œIndeed!â€--repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the
word. â€œAnd what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in thy
custody?â€

â€œI went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,â€ replied Gurth,
â€œthe price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this
tournament.â€

â€œAnd how much didst thou pay to Isaac?--Methinks, to judge by weight,
there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.â€

â€œI paid to Isaac,â€ said the Saxon, â€œeighty zecchins, and he restored me
a hundred in lieu thereof.â€

â€œHow! what!â€ exclaimed all the robbers at once; â€œdarest thou trifle with
us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?â€

â€œWhat I tell you,â€ said Gurth, â€œis as true as the moon is in heaven. You
will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch, and
separate from the rest of the gold.â€

â€œBethink thee, man,â€ said the Captain, â€œthou speakest of a Jew--of an
Israelite,--as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts to
return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.â€

â€œThere is no more mercy in them,â€ said another of the banditti, â€œthan in
an unbribed sheriffs officer.â€

â€œIt is, however, as I say,â€ said Gurth.

â€œStrike a light instantly,â€ said the Captain; â€œI will examine this said
purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jewâ€™s bounty is little
less miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the
wilderness.â€

A light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine
the purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of
Gurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the
issue of the search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden
exertion of strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their
hold, and might have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his
masterâ€™s property behind him. But such was no part of his intention.
He wrenched a quarter-staff from one of the fellows, struck down the
Captain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh
repossessed himself of the pouch and treasure. The thieves, however,
were too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty
Gurth.

â€œKnave!â€ said the Captain, getting up, â€œthou hast broken my head;
and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy
insolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak of
thy master; the knightâ€™s matters must go before the squireâ€™s, according
to the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the meantime--if
thou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy
life--Comrades!â€ he then said, addressing his gang, â€œthis purse is
embroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe the yeomanâ€™s tale
is true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us toll-free. He
is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him, since dogs should not
worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in abundance.â€

â€œLike us?â€ answered one of the gang; â€œI should like to hear how that is
made good.â€

â€œWhy, thou fool,â€ answered the Captain, â€œis he not poor and disinherited
as we are?--Doth he not win his substance at the swordâ€™s point as we
do?--Hath he not beaten Front-de-Boeuf and Malvoisin, even as we would
beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life and death of Brian
de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And were all
this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an
unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?â€

â€œNay, that were a shame,â€ muttered the other fellow; â€œand yet, when I
served in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples of
conscience. And this insolent peasant,--he too, I warrant me, is to be
dismissed scatheless?â€

â€œNot if THOU canst scathe him,â€ replied the Captain.--â€œHere, fellow,â€
 continued he, addressing Gurth, â€œcanst thou use the staff, that thou
starts to it so readily?â€

â€œI think,â€ said Gurth, â€œthou shouldst be best able to reply to that
question.â€

â€œNay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,â€ replied the Captain;
â€œdo as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou
dost not--why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think
I must pay thy ransom myself.--Take thy staff, Miller,â€ he added, â€œand
keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a
staff--there is light enough to lay on load by.â€

The two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped forward
into the centre of the open space, in order to have the full benefit of
the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their
comrade, â€œMiller! beware thy toll-dish.â€ The Miller, on the other hand,
holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round
his head after the fashion which the French call â€œfaire le moulinetâ€,
exclaimed boastfully, â€œCome on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel
the strength of a millerâ€™s thumb!â€

â€œIf thou beâ€™st a miller,â€ answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon
play around his head with equal dexterity, â€œthou art doubly a thief, and
I, as a true man, bid thee defiance.â€

So saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they
displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting
and returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid
dexterity, while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person
at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons
engaged on each side. Less obstinate, and even less dangerous combats,
have been described in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth and the
Miller must remain unsung, for want of a sacred poet to do justice to
its eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff play be out of date,
what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.

Long they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at
finding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his
companions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was
not a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in
which, as in ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite;
and it gave Gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the
opportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of
which he displayed great mastery.

The Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of
his weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance,
while Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about
a yard asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great
celerity, so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he maintain
the defensive, making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time, until,
observing his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face
with his left hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured to parry the thrust,
he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the
weapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head, who instantly
measured his length upon the green sward.

â€œWell and yeomanly done!â€ shouted the robbers; â€œfair play and Old
England for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and
the Miller has met his match.â€

â€œThou mayst go thy ways, my friend,â€ said the Captain, addressing Gurth,
in special confirmation of the general voice, â€œand I will cause two of
my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy masterâ€™s pavilion, and
to guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender consciences
than ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night
as this. Take heed, however,â€ he added sternly; â€œremember thou hast
refused to tell thy name--ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover
who or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou wilt come
by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.â€

Gurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to
his recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves,
and desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward
along a by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground
adjacent to it. On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his
conductors, and receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the
wood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced
Gurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers, and that they
kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.

When they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some
trouble in finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to
the top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him
in the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions
pitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them fluttering
in the moonbeams, and from which could be heard the hum of the song with
which the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.

Here the thieves stopt.

â€œWe go with you no farther,â€ said they; â€œit were not safe that we should
do so.--Remember the warning you have received--keep secret what has
this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it--neglect
what is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not protect you
against our revenge.â€

â€œGood night to you, kind sirs,â€ said Gurth; â€œI shall remember your
orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an
honester trade.â€

Thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence
they had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,
notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the
whole adventures of the evening.

The Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the
generosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not
profit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality
seemed totally foreign. His course of reflections upon these singular
circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking
repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety
of refreshing himself for the morrowâ€™s encounter, rendered alike
indispensable.

The knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch
with which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending
his hardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the
pavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one
could enter without awakening him.




CHAPTER XII

     The heralds left their pricking up and down,
     Now ringen trumpets loud and clarion.
     There is no more to say, but east and west,
     In go the speares sadly in the rest,
     In goth the sharp spur into the side,
     There see men who can just and who can ride;
     There shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,
     He feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;
     Up springen speares, twenty feet in height,
     Out go the swordes to the silver bright;
     The helms they to-hewn and to-shred;
     Out burst the blood with stern streames red.
     Chaucer.

Morning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above the
horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on the
common, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to secure a
favourable situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.

The marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together
with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights
who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This
was a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two
bodies who should be opposed to each other.

According to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be considered
as leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who had been
rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first
champion of the other band. Those who had concurred in the challenge
adhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de Vipont, whom his
fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. There was no want
of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either
side.

In fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought
at once, was more dangerous than single encounters, they were,
nevertheless, more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age.
Many knights, who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to
defy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous
of displaying their valour in the general combat, where they might
meet others with whom they were more upon an equality. On the present
occasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of combating
upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could be
admitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in
preferring their claim to be included.

About the hour of ten oâ€™clock, the whole plain was crowded with
horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;
and shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John
and his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take
share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.

About the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena,
unattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his
tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the
combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to
enlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed, had
remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had
made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually
given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course,
than strong in justifying it.

His best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though
his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend
himself to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible
to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already
fixed beyond doubt, by the assent of Cedric and her other friends. It
had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though
indolent Lord of Coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day
select Rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege
to confer. In order to punish him for a preference which seemed to
interfere with his own suit, Athelstane, confident of his strength,
and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had
determined not only to deprive the Disinherited Knight of his powerful
succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the
weight of his battle-axe.

De Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to
a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being
desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the
other hand, many other knights, both English and Norman, natives and
strangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that
the opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the
Disinherited Knight had approved himself.

As soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had
arrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well
upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet
her, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the Lady
Rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time,
and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.

â€œIt is thus,â€ said Prince John, â€œthat we set the dutiful example of
loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide to
the throne which she must this day occupy.--Ladies,â€ he said, â€œattend
your Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like
honours.â€

So saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite
his own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded
after her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary
sovereign.

No sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by
the shouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun
shone fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either
side, who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager
conference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of
battle, and supporting the conflict.

The heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney should
be rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the dangers
of the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict was to be
maintained with sharp swords and pointed lances.

The champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and
were confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace
or battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A
knight unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the
opposite side in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in that
case forbidden to assail him. When any knight could force his antagonist
to the extremity of the lists, so as to touch the palisade with his
person or arms, such opponent was obliged to yield himself vanquished,
and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the conqueror.
A knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the
combat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to recover his
feet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag his master out
of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and
his arms and horse declared forfeited. The combat was to cease as
soon as Prince John should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon;
another precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion
of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate. Any knight
breaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise transgressing the
rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript of his arms, and,
having his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the
bars of the palisade, and exposed to public derision, in punishment of
his unknightly conduct. Having announced these precautions, the heralds
concluded with an exhortation to each good knight to do his duty, and to
merit favour from the Queen of Beauty and of Love.

This proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their
stations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in long
procession, arranged themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to
each other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost
rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled
the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his place.

It was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so
many gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready
prepared for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles
like so many pillars of iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with
the same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing
the ground, gave signal of their impatience.

As yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points
glancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated
fluttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while the
marshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost exactness,
lest either party had more or fewer than the appointed number. The tale
was found exactly complete. The marshals then withdrew from the lists,
and William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder, pronounced the signal
words--â€œLaissez aller!â€ The trumpets sounded as he spoke--the spears of
the champions were at once lowered and placed in the rests--the spurs
were dashed into the flanks of the horses, and the two foremost ranks
of either party rushed upon each other in full gallop, and met in the
middle of the lists with a shock, the sound of which was heard at a
mileâ€™s distance. The rear rank of each party advanced at a slower pace
to sustain the defeated, and follow up the success of the victors of
their party.

The consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust
raised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was
a minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter.
When the fight became visible, half the knights on each side were
dismounted, some by the dexterity of their adversaryâ€™s lance,--some by
the superior weight and strength of opponents, which had borne down
both horse and man,--some lay stretched on earth as if never more to
rise,--some had already gained their feet, and were closing hand to hand
with those of their antagonists who were in the same predicament,--and
several on both sides, who had received wounds by which they were
disabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring to
extricate themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose lances
had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now
closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and
exchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the
combat.

The tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank
on either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their
companions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted--â€œHa!
Beau-seant! Beau-seant! [20]

â€œ--For the Temple--For the Temple!â€ The opposite party shouted in
answer--â€œDesdichado! Desdichado!â€--which watch-word they took from the
motto upon their leaderâ€™s shield.

The champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and
with alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the
southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one
or the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and
the shouts of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the
trumpets, and drowned the groans of those who fell, and lay rolling
defenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the
combatants was now defaced with dust and blood, and gave way at every
stroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the
crests, drifted upon the breeze like snow-flakes. All that was beautiful
and graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what was now
visible was only calculated to awake terror or compassion.

Yet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators,
who are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of
distinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a thrilling
interest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyes from a
sight so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might turn pale,
or a faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or a husband,
was struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies around encouraged
the combatants, not only by clapping their hands and waving their veils
and kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, â€œBrave lance! Good sword!â€ when
any successful thrust or blow took place under their observation.

Such being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game,
that of the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in
loud acclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so
riveted on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if they themselves
had dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed.
And between every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming,
â€œFight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!--Fight on--death
is better than defeat!--Fight on, brave knights!--for bright eyes behold
your deeds!â€

Amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to
discover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the
fight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both
displayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the
Disinherited Knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who
could be termed their unquestioned match. They repeatedly endeavoured to
single out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the
fall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory. Such,
however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part
of the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they were
repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom
was anxious to win honour, by measuring his strength against the leader
of the opposite party.

But when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had
yielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity
of the lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the
strife, the Templar and the Disinherited Knight at length encountered
hand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry
of honour, could inspire. Such was the address of each in parrying
and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and
involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.

But at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst;
the gigantic arm of Front-de-Boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous
strength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing
those immediately exposed to them. Finding themselves freed from their
immediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights
at the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage
to their party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival.
Turning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the Norman spurred
against the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the
other. It was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and
unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a
general cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one
exposed to such disadvantage.

â€œBeware! beware! Sir Disinherited!â€ was shouted so universally, that
the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the
Templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape
the charge of Athelstane and Front-de-Boeuf. These knights, therefore,
their aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the
object of their attack and the Templar, almost running their horses
against each other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their
horses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their
united purpose of bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.

Nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and
activity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.

This stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was
wounded, and those of Front-de-Boeuf and Athelstane were both tired with
the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with
the preceding exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the
Disinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he
mounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at swordâ€™s point his
three antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon
the wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing
now against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with
his sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in
return.

But although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it
was evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around
Prince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to
save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.

â€œNot I, by the light of Heaven!â€ answered Prince John; â€œthis
same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered
hospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to
let others have their turn.â€ As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident
changed the fortune of the day.

There was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in
black armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all
appearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted.
This knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto
evinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off with
seeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing
his advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he had hitherto
acted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in the tournament,
a circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of â€œLe
Noir Faineantâ€, or the Black Sluggard.

At once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered
the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to
his horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a
thunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, â€œDesdichado,
to the rescue!â€ It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight was
pressing upon the Templar, Front-de-Boeuf had got nigh to him with his
uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight dealt
a stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted
with violence scarcely abated on the â€œchamfronâ€ of the steed, and
Front-de-Boeuf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally stunned
by the fury of the blow. â€œLe Noir Faineantâ€ then turned his horse upon
Athelstane of Coningsburgh; and his own sword having been broken in his
encounter with Front-de-Boeuf, he wrenched from the hand of the bulky
Saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with
the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest, that
Athelstane also lay senseless on the field. Having achieved this double
feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally
unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of
his character, returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists,
leaving his leader to cope as he best could with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.
This was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. The
Templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the
Disinherited Knightâ€™s charge. Brian de Bois-Guilbert rolled on the
field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his
foot. His antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over
the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when
Prince John, more moved by the Templars dangerous situation than he had
been by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing
himself vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to
the conflict.

It was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued
to burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the
greater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time,
leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.

The squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to
attend their masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists
to pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with
the utmost care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the
quarters prepared for them in the adjoining village.

Thus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most
gallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four
knights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had
died upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded,
four or five of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for
life; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to
the grave with them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as
the Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms of Ashby.

It being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done
best, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight
whom the popular voice had termed â€œLe Noir Faineant.â€ It was pointed out
to the Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been
in fact won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the
day, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally
unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince
John adhered to his own opinion, on the ground that the Disinherited
Knight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance
of the Knight of the Black Armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in
awarding the prize.

To the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was
nowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the conflict
ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of
the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent
manner which had procured him the epithet of the Black Sluggard. After
he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of
the heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours
which had been assigned to him. Prince John had now no further excuse
for resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight, whom, therefore, he
named the champion of the day.

Through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour
and the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists
again conducted the victor to the foot of Prince Johnâ€™s throne.

â€œDisinherited Knight,â€ said Prince John, â€œsince by that title only
you will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the
honours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and
receive from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of
Honour which your valour has justly deserved.â€ The Knight bowed low and
gracefully, but returned no answer.

While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in
proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor--while ladies
waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks
joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the
Disinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of
honour which was occupied by the Lady Rowena.

On the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.
Indeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have
been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will;
and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time
across the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with a graceful
and dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she held in her
hand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals exclaimed with
one voice, â€œIt must not be thus--his head must be bare.â€ The knight
muttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow of his
helmet, but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque might
not be removed.

Whether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no
attention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting
the laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When
the helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a
young man of twenty-five were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair
hair. His countenance was as pale as death, and marked in one or two
places with streaks of blood.

Rowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at
once summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling herself,
as it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the violence
of sudden emotion, she placed upon the drooping head of the victor
the splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day, and
pronounced, in a clear and distinct tone, these words: â€œI bestow on thee
this chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this dayâ€™s
victor:â€ Here she paused a moment, and then firmly added, â€œAnd upon
brows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed!â€

The knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely Sovereign
by whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet farther
forward, lay prostrate at her feet.

There was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by
the sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to
separate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the
marshals of the field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoeâ€™s swoon, had
hastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had
penetrated his breastplate, and inflicted a wound in his side.




CHAPTER XIII

     â€œHeroes, approach!â€ Atrides thus aloud,
     â€œStand forth distinguishâ€™d from the circling crowd,
     Ye who by skill or manly force may claim,
     Your rivals to surpass and merit fame.
     This cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,
     For him who farthest sends the winged reed.â€
      --Iliad

The name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth
to mouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and
curiosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the
Prince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him,
however, with an air of scorn, â€œMy Lords,â€ said he, â€œand especially you,
Sir Prior, what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us, concerning
innate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the presence
of my brotherâ€™s minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder suit of
armour enclosed.â€

â€œFront-de-Boeuf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe,â€ said De
Bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had
laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the Princeâ€™s
retinue.

â€œAy,â€ answered Waldemar Fitzurse, â€œthis gallant is likely to reclaim
the castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your
Highnessâ€™s generosity has since given to Front-de-Boeuf.â€

â€œFront-de-Boeuf,â€ replied John, â€œis a man more willing to swallow three
manors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the rest,
sirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the
crown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to
perform the usual military service, in the room of those who have
wandered to foreign Countries, and can neither render homage nor service
when called upon.â€

The audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce
the Princeâ€™s assumed right altogether indubitable. â€œA generous
Prince!--a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of
rewarding his faithful followers!â€

Such were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of
them of similar grants at the expense of King Richardâ€™s followers and
favourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer
also assented to the general proposition, observing, however, â€œThat the
blessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She
was â€˜communis materâ€™--the mother of all Christians. But he saw not,â€
 he declared, â€œhow the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from
this, since heâ€ (the Prior) â€œwas assured that the crusaders, under
Richard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all
the world knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of
the privileges of the Holy City.â€

Waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe
had fallen to the ground, now returned. â€œThe gallant,â€ said he,
â€œis likely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave
Front-de-Boeuf in the quiet possession of his gains--he is severely
wounded.â€

â€œWhatever becomes of him,â€ said Prince John, â€œhe is victor of the day;
and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,
which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to--our own
physician shall attend him.â€

A stern smile curled the Princeâ€™s lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse
hastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and
in the custody of his friends.

â€œI was somewhat afflicted,â€ he said, â€œto see the grief of the Queen of
Love and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into
mourning. I am not a man to be moved by a womanâ€™s lament for her lover,
but this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form
before her.â€

â€œWho is this Lady Rowena,â€ said Prince John, â€œof whom we have heard so
much?â€

â€œA Saxon heiress of large possessions,â€ replied the Prior Aymer; â€œa rose
of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a
bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.â€

â€œWe shall cheer her sorrows,â€ said Prince John, â€œand amend her blood, by
wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be at our
royal disposal in marriage.--How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst thou
of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the fashion
of the followers of the Conqueror?â€

â€œIf the lands are to my liking, my lord,â€ answered De Bracy, â€œit will be
hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold myself bound
to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in
favour of your servant and vassal.â€

â€œWe will not forget it,â€ said Prince John; â€œand that we may instantly go
to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the
Lady Rowena and her company--that is, the rude churl her guardian, and
the Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament, upon
this eveningâ€™s banquet.--De Bigot,â€ he added to his seneschal, â€œthou
wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the
pride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;
although, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls
before swine.â€

Prince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for
retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.

â€œFrom whence?â€ said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was
delivered.

â€œFrom foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know notâ€ replied his
attendant. â€œA Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden night
and day to put it into the hands of your highness.â€

The Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the
seal, placed so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was
surrounded, and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis.
John then opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and
greatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were expressed
in these words:

â€œTake heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!â€

The Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and
then up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of
execution has been passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects of
his surprise, he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put
the billet into their hands successively. â€œIt means,â€ he added, in a
faltering voice, â€œthat my brother Richard has obtained his freedom.â€

â€œThis may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,â€ said De Bracy.

â€œIt is Franceâ€™s own hand and seal,â€ replied Prince John.

â€œIt is time, then,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œto draw our party to a head, either
at York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it will be
indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present mummery.â€

â€œThe yeomen and commons,â€ said De Bracy, â€œmust not be dismissed
discontented, for lack of their share in the sports.â€

â€œThe day,â€ said Waldemar, â€œis not yet very far spent--let the archers
shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. This will
be an abundant fulfilment of the Princeâ€™s promises, so far as this herd
of Saxon serfs is concerned.â€

â€œI thank thee, Waldemar,â€ said the Prince; â€œthou remindest me, too, that
I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our
person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. Were
this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and
to pleasure--let new cares come with to-morrowâ€™s new day.â€

The sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already
begun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince John,
suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself
obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrowâ€™s festival:
Nevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without
a trial of skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the
ground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for
the morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being a
bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented
with a medallion of St Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.

More than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors,
several of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of
Needwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom
they were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the
contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat.
For in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well
known for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at
Newmarket are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.

The diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to
eight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the
persons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery.
Having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the
object of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot,
and with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the
preceding day.

â€œFellow,â€ said Prince John, â€œI guessed by thy insolent babble that thou
wert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not adventure
thy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.â€

â€œUnder favour, sir,â€ replied the yeoman, â€œI have another reason for
refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace.â€

â€œAnd what is thy other reason?â€ said Prince John, who, for some cause
which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful
curiosity respecting this individual.

â€œBecause,â€ replied the woodsman, â€œI know not if these yeomen and I are
used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not how
your Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has
unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.â€

Prince John coloured as he put the question, â€œWhat is thy name, yeoman?â€

â€œLocksley,â€ answered the yeoman.

â€œThen, Locksley,â€ said Prince John, â€œthou shalt shoot in thy turn, when
these yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize,
I will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt
be stript of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with
bowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.â€

â€œAnd how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?â€ said the yeoman.--â€œYour
Graceâ€™s power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed
easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my
bow.â€

â€œIf thou refusest my fair proffer,â€ said the Prince, â€œthe Provost of the
lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel thee
from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.â€

â€œThis is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,â€ said the yeoman,
â€œto compel me to peril myself against the best archers of Leicester And
Staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me.
Nevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.â€

â€œLook to him close, men-at-arms,â€ said Prince John, â€œhis heart is
sinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.--And do you,
good fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready
for your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.â€

A target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led
to the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the
bottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the
mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers. The
archers, having previously determined by lot their order of precedence,
were to shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports were regulated
by an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of the Games; for the
high rank of the marshals of the lists would have been held degraded,
had they condescended to superintend the sports of the yeomanry.

One by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts
yeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession,
ten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,
considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. Of
the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot
by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was accordingly
pronounced victorious.

â€œNow, Locksley,â€ said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter
smile, â€œwilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up
bow, baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?â€

â€œSith it be no better,â€ said Locksley, â€œI am content to try my fortune;
on condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of
Hubertâ€™s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose.â€

â€œThat is but fair,â€ answered Prince John, â€œand it shall not be refused
thee.--If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle
with silver-pennies for thee.â€

â€œA man can do but his best,â€ answered Hubert; â€œbut my grandsire drew a
good long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory.â€

The former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size
placed in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill,
had the right to shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation,
long measuring the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his
bended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a
step forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm,
till the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he
drew his bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and
lighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the
centre.

â€œYou have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,â€ said his antagonist,
bending his bow, â€œor that had been a better shot.â€

So saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his
aim, Locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as
carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He
was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring,
yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which
marked the centre than that of Hubert.

â€œBy the light of heaven!â€ said Prince John to Hubert, â€œan thou suffer
that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!â€

Hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. â€œAn your highness
were to hang me,â€ he said, â€œa man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my
grandsire drew a good bow--â€

â€œThe foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!â€ interrupted
John, â€œshoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for
thee!â€

Thus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the
caution which he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary
allowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and
shot so successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the
target.

â€œA Hubert! a Hubert!â€ shouted the populace, more interested in a known
person than in a stranger. â€œIn the clout!--in the clout!--a Hubert for
ever!â€

â€œThou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,â€ said the Prince, with an
insulting smile.

â€œI will notch his shaft for him, however,â€ replied Locksley.

And letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it
lighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers.
The people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful
dexterity, that they could not even give vent to their surprise in their
usual clamour. â€œThis must be the devil, and no man of flesh and blood,â€
 whispered the yeomen to each other; â€œsuch archery was never seen since a
bow was first bent in Britain.â€

â€œAnd now,â€ said Locksley, â€œI will crave your Graceâ€™s permission to plant
such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome every brave
yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he
loves best.â€

He then turned to leave the lists. â€œLet your guards attend me,â€ he said,
â€œif you please--I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.â€

Prince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in
case of his escape: but the cry of â€œShame! shame!â€ which burst from the
multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.

Locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in
length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a manâ€™s thumb. He
began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time,
that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had
hitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. â€œFor his own part,â€
 he said, â€œand in the land where he was bred, men would as soon take for
their mark King Arthurâ€™s round-table, which held sixty knights around
it. A child of seven years old,â€ he said, â€œmight hit yonder target with
a headless shaft; but,â€ added he, walking deliberately to the other end
of the lists, and sticking the willow wand upright in the ground, â€œhe
that hits that rod at five-score yards, I call him an archer fit to bear
both bow and quiver before a king, an it were the stout King Richard
himself.â€

â€œMy grandsire,â€ said Hubert, â€œdrew a good bow at the battle of Hastings,
and never shot at such a mark in his life--and neither will I. If this
yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers--or rather, I yield
to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man
can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I
might as well shoot at the edge of our parsonâ€™s whittle, or at a wheat
straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I can
hardly see.â€

â€œCowardly dog!â€ said Prince John.--â€œSirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but,
if thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever
did so. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of
superior skill.â€

â€œI will do my best, as Hubert says,â€ answered Locksley; â€œno man can do
more.â€

So saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked
with attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought
was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former
shots. He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude
awaited the event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their
opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it
was aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in
admiration of Locksleyâ€™s skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his
person. â€œThese twenty nobles,â€ he said, â€œwhich, with the bugle, thou
hast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt
take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be
near to our person. For never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so
true an eye direct a shaft.â€

â€œPardon me, noble Prince,â€ said Locksley; â€œbut I have vowed, that if
ever I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard.
These twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave
a bow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the
trial, he would have hit the wand as well I.â€

Hubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the
stranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed
with the crowd, and was seen no more.

The victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped Johnâ€™s attention
so easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more
important meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called
upon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists,
and commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the
Jew. â€œTell the dog,â€ he said, â€œto send me, before sun-down, two thousand
crowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this ring for a
token. The rest of the money must be paid at York within six days. If
he neglects, I will have the unbelieving villainâ€™s head. Look that thou
pass him not on the way; for the circumcised slave was displaying his
stolen finery amongst us.â€

So saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the
whole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.




CHAPTER XIV

     In rough magnificence arrayâ€™d,
     When ancient Chivalry displayâ€™d
     The pomp of her heroic games,
     And crested chiefs and tissued dames
     Assembled, at the clarionâ€™s call,
     In some proud castleâ€™s high archâ€™d hall.
     --Warton

Prince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was
not the same building of which the stately ruins still interest the
traveller, and which was erected at a later period by the Lord Hastings,
High Chamberlain of England, one of the first victims of the tyranny
of Richard the Third, and yet better known as one of Shakspeareâ€™s
characters than by his historical fame. The castle and town of Ashby, at
this time, belonged to Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, who, during
the period of our history, was absent in the Holy Land. Prince John, in
the meanwhile, occupied his castle, and disposed of his domains without
scruple; and seeking at present to dazzle menâ€™s eyes by his hospitality
and magnificence, had given orders for great preparations, in order to
render the banquet as splendid as possible.

The purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions
the full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could
be collected which was esteemed fit for their masterâ€™s table. Guests
also were invited in great numbers; and in the necessity in which he
then found himself of courting popularity, Prince John had extended his
invitation to a few distinguished Saxon and Danish families, as well as
to the Norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. However
despised and degraded on ordinary occasions, the great numbers of
the Anglo-Saxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil
commotions which seemed approaching, and it was an obvious point of
policy to secure popularity with their leaders.

It was accordingly the Princeâ€™s intention, which he for some time
maintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which they
had been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple
made his ordinary habits and feelings bend to his interest, it was
the misfortune of this Prince, that his levity and petulance were
perpetually breaking out, and undoing all that had been gained by his
previous dissimulation.

Of this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent
thither by his father, Henry the Second, with the purpose of buying
golden opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important acquisition
to the English crown. Upon this occasion the Irish chieftains contended
which should first offer to the young Prince their loyal homage and
the kiss of peace. But, instead of receiving their salutations with
courtesy, John and his petulant attendants could not resist the
temptation of pulling the long beards of the Irish chieftains; a
conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented by these
insulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences to the English
domination in Ireland. It is necessary to keep these inconsistencies
of Johnâ€™s character in view, that the reader may understand his conduct
during the present evening.

In execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler
moments, Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane with distinguished
courtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the
indisposition of Rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her
not attending upon his gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were both
dressed in the ancient Saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in
itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was
so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that
Prince John took great credit to himself with Waldemar Fitzurse for
refraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day
rendered ridiculous. Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close
tunic and long mantle of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a
more convenient dress, than the garb of the Normans, whose under garment
was a long doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggonerâ€™s frock,
covered by a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither fit to defend the
wearer from cold or from rain, and the only purpose of which appeared
to be to display as much fur, embroidery, and jewellery work, as the
ingenuity of the tailor could contrive to lay upon it. The Emperor
Charlemagne, in whose reign they were first introduced, seems to have
been very sensible of the inconveniences arising from the fashion of
this garment. â€œIn Heavenâ€™s name,â€ said he, â€œto what purpose serve these
abridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are no cover, on horseback they
are no protection from the wind and rain, and when seated, they do not
guard our legs from the damp or the frost.â€

Nevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks
continued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, and
particularly among the princes of the House of Anjou. They were
therefore in universal use among Prince Johnâ€™s courtiers; and the
long mantle, which formed the upper garment of the Saxons, was held in
proportional derision.

The guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of
good cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on the Princeâ€™s progress,
having exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary
provisions were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern
professors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their
natural appearance. Besides these dishes of domestic origin, there were
various delicacies brought from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich
pastry, as well as of the simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only
used at the tables of the highest nobility. The banquet was crowned with
the richest wines, both foreign and domestic.

But, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking
an intemperate race. While indulging themselves in the pleasures of
the table, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to
attribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished Saxons, as vices
peculiar to their inferior station. Prince John, indeed, and those who
courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to
excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is
well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and
new ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners
of his countrymen.

With sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the
Norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of Athelstane
and Cedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were
unaccustomed. And while their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic
observation, the untaught Saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the
arbitrary rules established for the regulation of society. Now, it is
well known, that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual
breach either of real good breeding or of good morals, than appear
ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette. Thus Cedric,
who dried his hands with a towel, instead of suffering the moisture to
exhale by waving them gracefully in the air, incurred more ridicule than
his companion Athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share
the whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign
delicacies, and termed at that time a â€œKarum-Pieâ€. When, however, it
was discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that the Thane of
Coningsburgh (or Franklin, as the Normans termed him) had no idea
what he had been devouring, and that he had taken the contents of the
Karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact beccaficoes
and nightingales, his ignorance brought him in for an ample share of the
ridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his gluttony.

The long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated
freely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,--of
the unknown victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose
self-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had
won,--and of the gallant Ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours
of the day. The topics were treated with military frankness, and the
jest and laugh went round the hall. The brow of Prince John alone was
overclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed
agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints
from his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing
around him. On such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine
as if to raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by some
observation made abruptly or at random.

â€œWe drink this beaker,â€ said he, â€œto the health of Wilfred of Ivanhoe,
champion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his wound renders him
absent from our board--Let all fill to the pledge, and especially Cedric
of Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.â€

â€œNo, my lord,â€ replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his
untasted cup, â€œI yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth, who
at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs
of his fathers.â€

â€œâ€˜Tis impossible,â€ cried Prince John, with well-feigned astonishment,
â€œthat so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son!â€

â€œYet, my lord,â€ answered Cedric, â€œso it is with this Wilfred. He left my
homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brotherâ€™s court,
where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so
highly. He left it contrary to my wish and command; and in the days
of Alfred that would have been termed disobedience--ay, and a crime
severely punishable.â€

â€œAlas!â€ replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy,
â€œsince your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not
be enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial
disobedience.â€

Thus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of
Henry the Second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself had
been most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.

â€œI think,â€ said he, after a momentâ€™s pause, â€œthat my brother proposed to
confer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.â€

â€œHe did endow him with it,â€ answered Cedric; â€œnor is it my least quarrel
with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the very
domains which his fathers possessed in free and independent right.â€

â€œWe shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,â€ said Prince
John, â€œto confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not
be diminished by holding land of the British crown.--Sir Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf,â€ he said, turning towards that Baron, â€œI trust you will
so keep the goodly Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur
his fatherâ€™s farther displeasure by again entering upon that fief.â€

â€œBy St Anthony!â€ answered the black-browâ€™d giant, â€œI will consent that
your highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric or Wilfred, or the
best that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the gift with
which your highness has graced me.â€

â€œWhoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,â€ replied Cedric, offended
at a mode of expression by which the Normans frequently expressed their
habitual contempt of the English, â€œwill do thee an honour as great as it
is undeserved.â€

Front-de-Boeuf would have replied, but Prince Johnâ€™s petulance and
levity got the start.

â€œAssuredly,â€ said be, â€œmy lords, the noble Cedric speaks truth; and
his race may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their
pedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.â€

â€œThey go before us indeed in the field--as deer before dogs,â€ said
Malvoisin.

â€œAnd with good right may they go before us--forget not,â€ said the Prior
Aymer, â€œthe superior decency and decorum of their manners.â€

â€œTheir singular abstemiousness and temperance,â€ said De Bracy,
forgetting the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.

â€œTogether with the courage and conduct,â€ said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
â€œby which they distinguished themselves at Hastings and elsewhere.â€

While, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn,
followed their Princeâ€™s example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at
Cedric, the face of the Saxon became inflamed with passion, and
he glanced his eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick
succession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in
turn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at
a loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge.
At length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion; and, addressing
himself to Prince John as the head and front of the offence which he had
received, â€œWhatever,â€ he said, â€œhave been the follies and vices of our
race, a Saxon would have been held â€˜nideringâ€™,â€ [21] (the most emphatic
term for abject worthlessness,) â€œwho should in his own hall, and while
his own wine-cup passed, have treated, or suffered to be treated, an
unoffending guest as your highness has this day beheld me used; and
whatever was the misfortune of our fathers on the field of Hastings,
those may at least be silent,â€ here he looked at Front-de-Boeuf and the
Templar, â€œwho have within these few hours once and again lost saddle and
stirrup before the lance of a Saxon.â€

â€œBy my faith, a biting jest!â€ said Prince John. â€œHow like you it,
sirs?--Our Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd
in wit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times--What say ye,
my lords?--By this good light, I hold it best to take our galleys, and
return to Normandy in time.â€

â€œFor fear of the Saxons?â€ said De Bracy, laughing; â€œwe should need no
weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.â€

â€œA truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,â€ said Fitzurse;--â€œand it
were well,â€ he added, addressing the Prince, â€œthat your highness should
assure the worthy Cedric there is no insult intended him by jests, which
must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.â€

â€œInsult?â€ answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; â€œI
trust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any, to be
offered in my presence. Here! I fill my cup to Cedric himself, since he
refuses to pledge his sonâ€™s health.â€

The cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,
which, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the Saxon
that had been designed. He was not naturally acute of perception,
but those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this
flattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. He
was silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, â€œTo Sir
Athelstane of Coningsburgh.â€

The knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by
draining a huge goblet in answer to it.

â€œAnd now, sirs,â€ said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the wine
which he had drank, â€œhaving done justice to our Saxon guests, we
will pray of them some requital to our courtesy.--Worthy Thane,â€ he
continued, addressing Cedric, â€œmay we pray you to name to us some Norman
whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet
of wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?â€

Fitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of
the Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an
end to unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The
Saxon replied not to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and
filling his cup to the brim, he addressed Prince John in these words:
â€œYour highness has required that I should name a Norman deserving to
be remembered at our banquet. This, perchance, is a hard task, since
it calls on the slave to sing the praises of the master--upon the
vanquished, while pressed by all the evils of conquest, to sing the
praises of the conqueror. Yet I will name a Norman--the first in arms
and in place--the best and the noblest of his race. And the lips that
shall refuse to pledge me to his well-earned fame, I term false and
dishonoured, and will so maintain them with my life.--I quaff this
goblet to the health of Richard the Lion-hearted!â€

Prince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed
the Saxonâ€™s speech, started when that of his injured brother was so
unexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his
lips, then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company
at this unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe
to oppose as to comply with. Some of them, ancient and experienced
courtiers, closely imitated the example of the Prince himself, raising
the goblet to their lips, and again replacing it before them. There
were many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed, â€œLong live King
Richard! and may he be speedily restored to us!â€ And some few, among
whom were Front-de-Boeuf and the Templar, in sullen disdain suffered
their goblets to stand untasted before them. But no man ventured
directly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning
monarch.

Having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his
companion, â€œUp, noble Athelstane! we have remained here long enough,
since we have requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince Johnâ€™s banquet.
Those who wish to know further of our rude Saxon manners must henceforth
seek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal
banquets, and enough of Norman courtesy.â€

So saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by
Athelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxon
lineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and his
courtiers.

â€œBy the bones of St Thomas,â€ said Prince John, as they retreated, â€œthe
Saxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated with
triumph!â€

â€œâ€˜Conclamatum est, poculatum estâ€™,â€ said Prior Aymer; â€œwe have drunk and
we have shouted,--it were time we left our wine flagons.â€

â€œThe monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in such
a hurry to depart,â€ said De Bracy.

â€œNot so, Sir Knight,â€ replied the Abbot; â€œbut I must move several miles
forward this evening upon my homeward journey.â€

â€œThey are breaking up,â€ said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse; â€œtheir
fears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the first to shrink
from me.â€

â€œFear not, my lord,â€ said Waldemar; â€œI will show him such reasons as
shall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at York.--Sir
Prior,â€ he said, â€œI must speak with you in private, before you mount
your palfrey.â€

The other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those
immediately attached to Prince Johnâ€™s faction, and his retinue.

â€œThis, then, is the result of your advice,â€ said the Prince, turning
an angry countenance upon Fitzurse; â€œthat I should be bearded at my
own board by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my
brotherâ€™s name, men should fall off from me as if I had the leprosy?â€

â€œHave patience, sir,â€ replied his counsellor; â€œI might retort your
accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my
design, and misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for
recrimination. De Bracy and I will instantly go among these shuffling
cowards, and convince them they have gone too far to recede.â€

â€œIt will be in vain,â€ said Prince John, pacing the apartment with
disordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to which the
wine he had drank partly contributed--â€œIt will be in vain--they have
seen the handwriting on the wall--they have marked the paw of the
lion in the sand--they have heard his approaching roar shake the
wood--nothing will reanimate their courage.â€

â€œWould to God,â€ said Fitzurse to De Bracy, â€œthat aught could reanimate
his own! His brotherâ€™s very name is an ague to him. Unhappy are the
counsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in
good and in evil!â€




CHAPTER XV

     And yet he thinks,--ha, ha, ha, ha,--he thinks
     I am the tool and servant of his will.
     Well, let it be; through all the maze of trouble
     His plots and base oppression must create,
     Iâ€™ll shape myself a way to higher things,
     And who will say â€˜tis wrong?
     --Basil, a Tragedy

No spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his
web, than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered
members of Prince Johnâ€™s cabal. Few of these were attached to him from
inclination, and none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary,
that Fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind
them of those which they at present enjoyed. To the young and wild
nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled
revelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of
increased wealth and extended domains. The leaders of the mercenaries
received a donation in gold; an argument the most persuasive to their
minds, and without which all others would have proved in vain. Promises
were still more liberally distributed than money by this active agent;
and, in fine, nothing was left undone that could determine the wavering,
or animate the disheartened. The return of King Richard he spoke of
as an event altogether beyond the reach of probability; yet, when
he observed, from the doubtful looks and uncertain answers which he
received, that this was the apprehension by which the minds of his
accomplices were most haunted, he boldly treated that event, should
it really take place, as one which ought not to alter their political
calculations.

â€œIf Richard returns,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œhe returns to enrich his needy and
impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow him
to the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those who,
during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or
encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of
the crown. He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the
Hospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during
the wars in the Holy Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel
every adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?â€
 continued the artful confident of that Prince, â€œwe acknowledge him a
strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur,
when a champion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back,
it must be alone,--unfollowed--unfriended. The bones of his gallant army
have whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have
returned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared
and broken men.--And what talk ye of Richardâ€™s right of birth?â€ he
proceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. â€œIs
Richardâ€™s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of
Duke Robert of Normandy, the Conquerorâ€™s eldest son? And yet William
the Red, and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively
preferred to him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit
which can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader,
generous to his friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a
crusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind
and miserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed
himself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule
over them. It is our right,â€ he said, â€œto choose from the blood royal
the prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme power--that is,â€
 said he, correcting himself, â€œhim whose election will best promote the
interests of the nobility. In personal qualifications,â€ he added, â€œit
was possible that Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard;
but when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of
vengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities,
privileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted which was the
king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support.â€

These, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar
circumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with
the nobles of Prince Johnâ€™s faction. Most of them consented to attend
the proposed meeting at York, for the purpose of making general
arrangements for placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.

It was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various
exertions, however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to
the Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting
garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and
colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over
his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows stuck in
his belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment, he would
have passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the guard; but
finding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and
recognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English yeoman.

â€œWhat mummery is this, De Bracy?â€ said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; â€œis
this a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of
our master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast thou
not been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name
of King Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the
Saracens?â€

â€œI have been attending to mine own business,â€ answered De Bracy calmly,
â€œas you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.â€

â€œI minding mine own business!â€ echoed Waldemar; â€œI have been engaged in
that of Prince John, our joint patron.â€

â€œAs if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,â€ said De Bracy,
â€œthan the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse,
we know each other--ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they
become our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that
he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy
monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too
fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch
by whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you
aid him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free Companions.â€

â€œA hopeful auxiliary,â€ said Fitzurse impatiently; â€œplaying the fool in
the very moment of utter necessity.--What on earth dost thou purpose by
this absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?â€

â€œTo get me a wife,â€ answered De Bracy coolly, â€œafter the manner of the
tribe of Benjamin.â€

â€œThe tribe of Benjamin?â€ said Fitzurse; â€œI comprehend thee not.â€

â€œWert thou not in presence yester-even,â€ said De Bracy, â€œwhen we heard
the Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung by
the Minstrel?--He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud arose
between the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish nation;
and how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that tribe; and
how they swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not permit those
who remained to marry in their lineage; and how they became grieved for
their vow, and sent to consult his holiness the Pope how they might be
absolved from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy Father, the youth
of the tribe of Benjamin carried off from a superb tournament all the
ladies who were there present, and thus won them wives without the
consent either of their brides or their bridesâ€™ families.â€

â€œI have heard the story,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œthough either the Prior or
thou has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances.â€

â€œI tell thee,â€ said De Bracy, â€œthat I mean to purvey me a wife after the
fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say, that in
this same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks, who
have this night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely
Rowena.â€

â€œArt thou mad, De Bracy?â€ said Fitzurse. â€œBethink thee that, though the
men be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more
respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of
few of Saxon descent.â€

â€œAnd should belong to none,â€ said De Bracy; â€œthe work of the Conquest
should be completed.â€

â€œThis is no time for it at least,â€ said Fitzurse â€œthe approaching crisis
renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and Prince John
cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.â€

â€œLet him grant it, if he dare,â€ said De Bracy; â€œhe will soon see the
difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine,
and that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate
discovery of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever
blew horn? The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the
Yorkshire forests. I have sure spies on the Saxonâ€™s motions--To-night
they sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they
call that churl of a Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next dayâ€™s march
brings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them
at once. Presently after I will appear in mine own shape, play the
courteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the
hands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to Front-de-Boeufâ€™s Castle, or
to Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her
kindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy.â€

â€œA marvellously sage plan,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œand, as I think, not
entirely of thine own device.--Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided
thee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I
think, thine own band lies as far off as York.â€

â€œMarry, if thou must needs know,â€ said De Bracy, â€œit was the Templar
Brian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the
adventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in
the onslaught, and he and his followers will personate the outlaws, from
whom my valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the lady.â€

â€œBy my halidome,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œthe plan was worthy of your united
wisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in the
project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate. Thou
mayst, I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but how
thou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert seems
considerably more doubtful--He is a falcon well accustomed to pounce on
a partridge, and to hold his prey fast.â€

â€œHe is a Templar,â€ said De Bracy, â€œand cannot therefore rival me in
my plan of wedding this heiress;--and to attempt aught dishonourable
against the intended bride of De Bracy--By Heaven! were he a whole
Chapter of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an
injury!â€

â€œThen since nought that I can say,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œwill put this
folly from thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy
disposition,) at least waste as little time as possible--let not thy
folly be lasting as well as untimely.â€

â€œI tell thee,â€ answered De Bracy, â€œthat it will be the work of a few
hours, and I shall be at York--at the head of my daring and valorous
fellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to
form one.--But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping
and neighing in the outer court.--Farewell.--I go, like a true knight,
to win the smiles of beauty.â€

â€œLike a true knight?â€ repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; â€œlike a
fool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most serious and
needful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives
past him.--But it is with such tools that I must work;--and for whose
advantage?--For that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as
likely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious
son and an unnatural brother.--But he--he, too, is but one of the tools
with which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate
his interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.â€

The meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice
of the Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, â€œNoble Waldemar
Fitzurse!â€ and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such
high preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the
orders of the future sovereign.




CHAPTER XVI

     Far in a wild, unknown to public view,
     From youth to age a reverend hermit grew;
     The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,
     His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well
     Remote from man, with God he passâ€™d his days,
     Prayer all his business--all his pleasure praise.
     --Parnell

The reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was
decided by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, on account of the
passive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former
part of the day, the spectators had entitled, â€œLe Noir Faineantâ€. This
knight had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved; and
when he was called upon to receive the reward of his valour, he was
nowhere to be found. In the meantime, while summoned by heralds and
by trumpets, the knight was holding his course northward, avoiding all
frequented paths, and taking the shortest road through the woodlands.
He paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary
route, where, however, he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of the
event of the tourney.

On the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention
of making a long journey; the condition of his horse, which he had
carefully spared during the preceding morning, being such as enabled him
to travel far without the necessity of much repose. Yet his purpose was
baffled by the devious paths through which he rode, so that when evening
closed upon him, he only found himself on the frontiers of the
West Riding of Yorkshire. By this time both horse and man required
refreshment, and it became necessary, moreover, to look out for
some place in which they might spend the night, which was now fast
approaching.

The place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for
obtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be reduced
to the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned
their horses to graze, and laid themselves down to meditate on their
lady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. But the Black Knight
either had no mistress to meditate upon, or, being as indifferent
in love as he seemed to be in war, was not sufficiently occupied by
passionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to be able to
parry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as
a substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. He felt
dissatisfied, therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply
involved in woods, through which indeed there were many open glades,
and some paths, but such as seemed only formed by the numerous herds of
cattle which grazed in the forest, or by the animals of chase, and the
hunters who made prey of them.

The sun, by which the knight had chiefly directed his course, had now
sunk behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effort which he
might make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his
road as to advance him on his route. After having in vain endeavoured
to select the most beaten path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage of
some herdsman, or the silvan lodge of a forester, and having repeatedly
found himself totally unable to determine on a choice, the knight
resolved to trust to the sagacity of his horse; experience having,
on former occasions, made him acquainted with the wonderful talent
possessed by these animals for extricating themselves and their riders
on such emergencies.

The good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a dayâ€™s journey under
a rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackened reins,
that he was abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new
strength and spirit; and whereas, formerly he had scarce replied to the
spur, otherwise than by a groan, he now, as if proud of the confidence
reposed in him, pricked up his ears, and assumed, of his own accord, a
more lively motion. The path which the animal adopted rather turned off
from the course pursued by the knight during the day; but as the horse
seemed confident in his choice, the rider abandoned himself to his
discretion.

He was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared
a little wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the
knight to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or
hermitage.

Accordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side
of which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered
its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides
in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found
nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below,
like the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet, giving grace to
that whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the rock,
and leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut, built
chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and
secured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss
mingled with clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its branches,
with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by
the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on
the right hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the
rock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a
rustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured down the descent
by a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the
little plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.

Beside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which
the roof had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, had never been
above sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof, low
in proportion, rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from
the four corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy
pillar. The ribs of two of these arches remained, though the roof
had fallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. The
entrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round
arch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling
sharkâ€™s teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient Saxon
architecture. A belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars,
within which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of
which had been some time before heard by the Black Knight.

The whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before
the eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the
night; since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in
the woods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered
passengers.

Accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the
particulars which we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (the
patron of travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from
his horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his
lance, in order to arouse attention and gain admittance.

It was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when
made, was unpropitious.

â€œPass on, whosoever thou art,â€ was the answer given by a deep hoarse
voice from within the hut, â€œand disturb not the servant of God and St
Dunstan in his evening devotions.â€

â€œWorthy father,â€ answered the knight, â€œhere is a poor wanderer
bewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of exercising
thy charity and hospitality.â€

â€œGood brother,â€ replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, â€œit has pleased
Our Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object of those virtues,
instead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here which even a
dog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would
despise my couch--pass therefore on thy way, and God speed thee.â€

â€œBut how,â€ replied the knight, â€œis it possible for me to find my way
through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you,
reverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least
point out to me my road.â€

â€œAnd I pray you, good Christian brother,â€ replied the anchorite, â€œto
disturb me no more. You have already interrupted one â€˜paterâ€™, two
â€˜avesâ€™, and a â€˜credoâ€™, which I, miserable sinner that I am, should,
according to my vow, have said before moonrise.â€

â€œThe road--the road!â€ vociferated the knight, â€œgive me directions for
the road, if I am to expect no more from thee.â€

â€œThe road,â€ replied the hermit, â€œis easy to hit. The path from the wood
leads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains have
abated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou
wilt take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat
precipitous; and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I
learn, (for I seldom leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in sundry
places. Thou wilt then keep straight forward---â€

â€œA broken path--a precipice--a ford, and a morass!â€ said the knight
interrupting him,--â€œSir Hermit, if you were the holiest that ever wore
beard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road
to-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the
country--ill deserved, as I doubt it is--hast no right to refuse shelter
to the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the door quickly, or, by
the rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.â€

â€œFriend wayfarer,â€ replied the hermit, â€œbe not importunate; if thou
puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be eâ€™en
the worse for you.â€

At this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the
traveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious,
and made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of
making forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to
aid him in his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been
kennelled. Incensed at this preparation on the hermitâ€™s part for making
good his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously
with his foot, that posts as well as staples shook with violence.

The anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock,
now called out aloud, â€œPatience, patience--spare thy strength, good
traveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my
doing so will be little to thy pleasure.â€

The door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built
man, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood
before the knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in
the other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well
be termed a club. Two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff,
stood ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be
opened. But when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs
of the knight, who stood without, the hermit, altering probably his
original intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and,
changing his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the knight
to enter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge
after sunset, by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were
abroad, and who gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those
holy men who spent life in their service.

â€œThe poverty of your cell, good father,â€ said the knight, looking around
him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely carved
in oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two
clumsy articles of furniture--â€œthe poverty of your cell should seem a
sufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid
of two trusty dogs, large and strong enough, I think, to pull down a
stag, and of course, to match with most men.â€

â€œThe good keeper of the forest,â€ said the hermit, â€œhath allowed me
the use of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times shall
mend.â€

Having said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which
served for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet before the
embers of the fire, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a
stool upon one side of the table, and beckoned to the knight to do the
same upon the other.

They sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking
in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure
than was placed opposite to him.

â€œReverend hermit,â€ said the knight, after looking long and fixedly at
his host, â€œwere it not to interrupt your devout meditations, I would
pray to know three things of your holiness; first, where I am to put my
horse?--secondly, what I can have for supper?--thirdly, where I am to
take up my couch for the night?â€

â€œI will reply to you,â€ said the hermit, â€œwith my finger, it being
against my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose.â€
 So saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. â€œYour
stable,â€ said he, â€œis there--your bed there; and,â€ reaching down a
platter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring
shelf, and placing it upon the table, he added, â€œyour supper is here.â€

The knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his
horse, (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,) unsaddled him
with much attention, and spread upon the steedâ€™s weary back his own
mantle.

The hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as
well as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse; for,
muttering something about provender left for the keeperâ€™s palfrey, he
dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before the
knightâ€™s charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of
dried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the riderâ€™s couch.
The knight returned him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty done,
both resumed their seats by the table, whereon stood the trencher of
pease placed between them. The hermit, after a long grace, which had
once been Latin, but of which original language few traces remained,
excepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or
phrase, set example to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large
mouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a
boar both in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a
miserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill.

The knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his
helmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to
the hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue
eyes, remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an
upper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing
altogether the look of a bold, daring, and enterprising man, with which
his strong form well corresponded.

The hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest,
threw back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man
in the prime of life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle
of stiff curled black hair, had something the appearance of a parish
pinfold begirt by its high hedge. The features expressed nothing of
monastic austerity, or of ascetic privations; on the contrary, it was
a bold bluff countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned
forehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter,
from which descended a long and curly black beard. Such a visage,
joined to the brawny form of the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and
haunches, than of pease and pulse. This incongruity did not escape the
guest. After he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication
of a mouthful of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary
to request his pious entertainer to furnish him with some liquor; who
replied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest
water from the fountain.

â€œIt is from the well of St Dunstan,â€ said he, â€œin which, betwixt sun and
sun, he baptized five hundred heathen Danes and Britons--blessed be his
name!â€ And applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a draught
much more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to warrant.

â€œIt seems to me, reverend father,â€ said the knight, â€œthat the small
morsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin
beverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more
fit to win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at
quarter-staff, or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your
time in this desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living upon parched
pease and cold water.â€

â€œSir Knight,â€ answered the hermit, â€œyour thoughts, like those of the
ignorant laity, are according to the flesh. It has pleased Our Lady and
my patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even
as the pulse and water was blessed to the children Shadrach, Meshech,
and Abednego, who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the
wine and meats which were appointed them by the King of the Saracens.â€

â€œHoly father,â€ said the knight, â€œupon whose countenance it hath pleased
Heaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy
name?â€

â€œThou mayst call me,â€ answered the hermit, â€œthe Clerk of Copmanhurst,
for so I am termed in these parts--They add, it is true, the
epithet holy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such
addition.--And now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name of my
honourable guest?â€

â€œTruly,â€ said the knight, â€œHoly Clerk of Copmanhurst, men call me in
these parts the Black Knight,--many, sir, add to it the epithet of
Sluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.â€

The hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guestâ€™s reply.

â€œI see,â€ said he, â€œSir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man of prudence
and of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monastic fare likes
thee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of
courts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now I bethink me,
Sir Sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left
those dogs for my protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left
me also some food, which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection
of it had escaped me amid my more weighty meditations.â€

â€œI dare be sworn he did so,â€ said the knight; â€œI was convinced that
there was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you first doffed
your cowl.--Your keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who beheld thy
grinders contending with these pease, and thy throat flooded with this
ungenial element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and
horse-beverage,â€ (pointing to the provisions upon the table,) â€œand
refrain from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeperâ€™s bounty,
therefore, without delay.â€

The hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was
a sort of comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how far he
should act prudently in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much
of bold frankness in the knightâ€™s countenance as was possible to be
expressed by features. His smile, too, had something in it irresistibly
comic, and gave an assurance of faith and loyalty, with which his host
could not refrain from sympathizing.

After exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further
side of the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealed with great care
and some ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into which
this aperture gave admittance, he brought a large pasty, baked in a
pewter platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed before
his guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost no time in making
himself acquainted with its contents.

â€œHow long is it since the good keeper has been here?â€ said the knight
to his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this
reinforcement to the hermitâ€™s good cheer.

â€œAbout two months,â€ answered the father hastily.

â€œBy the true Lord,â€ answered the knight, â€œevery thing in your hermitage
is miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been sworn that the fat buck
which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the week.â€

The hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and,
moreover, he made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of
the pasty, on which his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare
in which his previous profession of abstinence left him no pretext for
joining.

â€œI have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,â€ said the knight, stopping short
of a sudden, â€œand I bethink me it is a custom there that every host who
entertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food, by
partaking of it along with him. Far be it from me to suspect so holy a
man of aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you
would you comply with this Eastern custom.â€

â€œTo ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart
from my rule,â€ replied the hermit. And as there were no forks in those
days, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.

The ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry
between the guest and the entertainer which should display the best
appetite; and although the former had probably fasted longest, yet the
hermit fairly surpassed him.

â€œHoly Clerk,â€ said the knight, when his hunger was appeased, â€œI would
gage my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that that same honest
keeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of
wine, or a runlet of canary, or some such trifle, by way of ally to this
noble pasty. This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally unworthy
to dwell in the memory of so rigid an anchorite; yet, I think, were you
to search yonder crypt once more, you would find that I am right in my
conjecture.â€

The hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he
produced a leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts. He
also brought forth two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of
the urus, and hooped with silver. Having made this goodly provision
for washing down the supper, he seemed to think no farther ceremonious
scruple necessary on his part; but filling both cups, and saying, in the
Saxon fashion, â€œâ€˜Waes haelâ€™, Sir Sluggish Knight!â€ he emptied his own at
a draught.

â€œâ€˜Drink haelâ€™, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!â€ answered the warrior, and did
his host reason in a similar brimmer.

â€œHoly Clerk,â€ said the stranger, after the first cup was thus swallowed,
â€œI cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and sinews as
thine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a trencher-man,
should think of abiding by himself in this wilderness. In my judgment,
you are fitter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the fat and
drinking of the strong, than to live here upon pulse and water, or even
upon the charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I should find
myself both disport and plenty out of the kingâ€™s deer. There is many a
goodly herd in these forests, and a buck will never be missed that goes
to the use of Saint Dunstanâ€™s chaplain.â€

â€œSir Sluggish Knight,â€ replied the Clerk, â€œthese are dangerous words,
and I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the king and law,
and were I to spoil my liegeâ€™s game, I should be sure of the prison,
and, an my gown saved me not, were in some peril of hanging.â€

â€œNevertheless, were I as thou,â€ said the knight, â€œI would take my walk
by moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed, and ever
and anon,--as I pattered my prayers,--I would let fly a shaft among the
herds of dun deer that feed in the glades--Resolve me, Holy Clerk, hast
thou never practised such a pastime?â€

â€œFriend Sluggard,â€ answered the hermit, â€œthou hast seen all that can
concern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than he deserves who
takes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy
the good which God sends thee, than to be impertinently curious how it
comes. Fill thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further
impertinent enquiries, put me to show that thou couldst hardly have made
good thy lodging had I been earnest to oppose thee.â€

â€œBy my faith,â€ said the knight, â€œthou makest me more curious than ever!
Thou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I will know more of
thee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to
one whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met with.â€

â€œSir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,â€ said the hermit; â€œrespecting thy
valour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thy discretion. If thou
wilt take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all friendship and
brotherly love, such sufficing penance and complete absolution, that
thou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of
curiosity.â€

The knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.

â€œThere is none,â€ replied the hermit, â€œfrom the scissors of Delilah, and
the tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which I am not
a match for thee--But, if I am to make the election, what sayst thou,
good friend, to these trinkets?â€

Thus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple
of broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by the yeomanry of the
period. The knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second
place of concealment was furnished with two or three good long-bows, a
cross-bow, a bundle of bolts for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves of
arrows for the former. A harp, and other matters of a very uncanonical
appearance, were also visible when this dark recess was opened.

â€œI promise thee, brother Clerk,â€ said he, â€œI will ask thee no more
offensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answer to all
my enquiries; and I see a weapon thereâ€ (here he stooped and took out
the harp) â€œon which I would more gladly prove my skill with thee, than
at the sword and buckler.â€

â€œI hope, Sir Knight,â€ said the hermit, â€œthou hast given no good reason
for thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspect thee
grievously. Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy
manhood to the proof without thine own free will. Sit thee down, then,
and fill thy cup; let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest ever
a good lay, thou shalt be welcome to a nook of pasty at Copmanhurst so
long as I serve the chapel of St Dunstan, which, please God, shall be
till I change my grey covering for one of green turf. But come, fill a
flagon, for it will crave some time to tune the harp; and nought pitches
the voice and sharpens the ear like a cup of wine. For my part, I
love to feel the grape at my very finger-ends before they make the
harp-strings tinkle.â€ [22]




CHAPTER XVII

     At eve, within yon studious nook,
     I ope my brass-embossed book,
     Portrayâ€™d with many a holy deed
     Of martyrs crownâ€™d with heavenly meed;
     Then, as my taper waxes dim,
     Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.
     * * * * *
     Who but would cast his pomp away,
     To take my staff and amice grey,
     And to the worldâ€™s tumultuous stage,
     Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?
     --Warton

Notwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his
guest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp
to harmony.

â€œMethinks, holy father,â€ said he, â€œthe instrument wants one string, and
the rest have been somewhat misused.â€

â€œAy, markâ€™st thou that?â€ replied the hermit; â€œthat shows thee a master
of the craft. Wine and wassail,â€ he added, gravely casting up his
eyes--â€œall the fault of wine and wassail!--I told Allan-a-Dale, the
northern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touched it after
the seventh cup, but he would not be controlled--Friend, I drink to thy
successful performance.â€

So saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time
shaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.

The knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order,
and after a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a
â€œsirventeâ€ in the language of â€œocâ€, or a â€œlaiâ€ in the language of â€œouiâ€,
or a â€œvirelaiâ€, or a ballad in the vulgar English. [23]

â€œA ballad, a ballad,â€ said the hermit, â€œagainst all the â€˜ocsâ€™ and â€˜ouisâ€™
of France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downright English
was my patron St Dunstan, and scorned â€˜ocâ€™ and â€˜ouiâ€™, as he would have
scorned the parings of the devilâ€™s hoof--downright English alone shall
be sung in this cell.â€

â€œI will assay, then,â€ said the knight, â€œa ballad composed by a Saxon
glee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.â€

It speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of
the minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under
the best instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a voice
which had little compass, and was naturally rough rather than mellow,
and, in short, had done all that culture can do in supplying natural
deficiencies. His performance, therefore, might have been termed very
respectable by abler judges than the hermit, especially as the knight
threw into the notes now a degree of spirit, and now of plaintive
enthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the verses which he sung.


     THE CRUSADERâ€™S RETURN.

     1.

     High deeds achieved of knightly fame,
     From Palestine the champion came;
     The cross upon his shoulders borne,
     Battle and blast had dimmâ€™d and torn.
     Each dint upon his batterâ€™d shield
     Was token of a foughten field;
     And thus, beneath his ladyâ€™s bower,
     He sung as fell the twilight hour:--

     2.

     â€œJoy to the fair!--thy knight behold,
     Returnâ€™d from yonder land of gold;
     No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,
     Save his good arms and battle-steed
     His spurs, to dash against a foe,
     His lance and sword to lay him low;
     Such all the trophies of his toil,
     Such--and the hope of Teklaâ€™s smile!

     3.

     â€œJoy to the fair! whose constant knight
     Her favour fired to feats of might;
     Unnoted shall she not remain,
     Where meet the bright and noble train;
     Minstrel shall sing and herald tell--
     â€˜Mark yonder maid of beauty well,
     â€˜Tis she for whose bright eyes were won
     The listed field at Askalon!

     4.

     â€œâ€˜Note well her smile!--it edged the blade
     Which fifty wives to widows made,
     When, vain his strength and Mahoundâ€™s spell,
     Iconiumâ€™s turbanâ€™d Soldan fell.
     Seest thou her locks, whose sunny glow
     Half shows, half shades, her neck of snow?
     Twines not of them one golden thread,
     But for its sake a Paynim bled.â€™

     5.

     â€œJoy to the fair!--my name unknown,
     Each deed, and all its praise thine own
     Then, oh! unbar this churlish gate,
     The night dew falls, the hour is late.
     Inured to Syriaâ€™s glowing breath,
     I feel the north breeze chill as death;
     Let grateful love quell maiden shame,
     And grant him bliss who brings thee fame.â€

During this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a
first-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back
upon his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and
twisting his thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon,
balancing his expanded palms, he gently flourished them in time to the
music. At one or two favourite cadences, he threw in a little assistance
of his own, where the knightâ€™s voice seemed unable to carry the air
so high as his worshipful taste approved. When the song was ended, the
anchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well sung.

â€œAnd yet,â€ said he, â€œI think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough
with the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties.
What took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to
find his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his
serenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a
cat in the gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee,
to the success of all true lovers--I fear you are none,â€ he added, on
observing that the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these
repeated draughts) qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.

â€œWhy,â€ said the knight, â€œdid you not tell me that this water was from
the well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?â€

â€œAy, truly,â€ said the hermit, â€œand many a hundred of pagans did he
baptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing
should be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well
as any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.â€

And so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with
the following characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus,
appropriate to an old English ditty. [24]


     THE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.

     1.

     Iâ€™ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,
     To search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;
     But neâ€™er shall you find, should you search till you tire,
     So happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.

     2.

     Your knight for his lady pricks forth in career,
     And is brought home at even-song prickâ€™d through with a spear;
     I confess him in haste--for his lady desires
     No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friarâ€™s.

     3.

     Your monarch?--Pshaw! many a prince has been known
     To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,
     But which of us eâ€™er felt the idle desire
     To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!

     4.

     The Friar has walkâ€™d out, and whereâ€™er he has gone,
     The land and its fatness is markâ€™d for his own;
     He can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,
     For every manâ€™s house is the Barefooted Friarâ€™s.

     5.

     Heâ€™s expected at noon, and no wight till he comes
     May profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums
     For the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,
     Is the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.

     6.

     Heâ€™s expected at night, and the pastyâ€™s made hot,
     They broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot,
     And the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,
     Ere he lackâ€™d a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.

     7.

     Long flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,
     The dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;
     For to gather lifeâ€™s roses, unscathed by the briar,
     Is granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.


â€œBy my troth,â€ said the knight, â€œthou hast sung well and lustily, and in
high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy Clerk,
are you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your
uncanonical pastimes?â€

â€œI uncanonical!â€ answered the hermit; â€œI scorn the charge--I scorn it
with my heels!--I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly--Two masses
daily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, â€˜aves, credos,
patersâ€™---â€

â€œExcepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,â€ said his
guest.

â€œâ€˜Exceptis excipiendisâ€™â€ replied the hermit, â€œas our old abbot taught me
to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept every punctilio
of mine order.â€

â€œTrue, holy father,â€ said the knight; â€œbut the devil is apt to keep
an eye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring
lion.â€

â€œLet him roar here if he dares,â€ said the friar; â€œa touch of my cord
will make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I
never feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint
Dunstan, Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert,
Saint Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor
merits to speed, I defy every devil of them, come cut and long
tail.--But to let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects,
my friend, until after morning vespers.â€

He changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the
parties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels
were interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.

The occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the
adventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we
do not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with
any one personage of our drama.




CHAPTER XVIII

     Away! our journey lies through dell and dingle,
     Where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,
     Where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,
     Chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley--
     Up and away!--for lovely paths are these
     To tread, when the glad Sun is on his throne
     Less pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthiaâ€™s lamp
     With doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.
     --Ettrick Forest

When Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at
Ashby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of
his own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not
bring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son
whom he had renounced and disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to
keep an eye upon him; and directed that officer, with two of his serfs,
to convey Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. Oswald,
however, was anticipated in this good office. The crowd dispersed,
indeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.

It was in vain that Cedricâ€™s cupbearer looked around for his young
master--he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but
himself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him
from the spot. Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons were very superstitious)
might have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoeâ€™s
disappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired
like a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant
Gurth. Anxious concerning his masterâ€™s fate, and in despair at his
sudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him
everywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which
his own safety depended. Oswald deemed it his duty to secure Gurth, as a
fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.

Renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only
information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders
was, that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired
grooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators,
which had immediately transported him out of the press. Oswald, on
receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his master for
farther instructions, carrying along with him Gurth, whom he considered
in some sort as a deserter from the service of Cedric.

The Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions
concerning his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the
patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he
informed that Ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands,
than the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his
fate, gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at
what he termed Wilfredâ€™s filial disobedience.

â€œLet him wander his way,â€ said he--â€œlet those leech his wounds for whose
sake he encountered them. He is fitter to do the juggling tricks of
the Norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his English
ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his
country.â€

â€œIf to maintain the honour of ancestry,â€ said Rowena, who was present,
â€œit is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution--to be
boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I know no voice,
save his fatherâ€™s---â€

â€œBe silent, Lady Rowena!--on this subject only I hear you not. Prepare
yourself for the Princeâ€™s festival: we have been summoned thither with
unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty
Normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of Hastings.
Thither will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little
the fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a Saxon.â€

â€œThither,â€ said Rowena, â€œdo I NOT go; and I pray you to beware, lest
what you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of
heart.â€

â€œRemain at home, then, ungrateful lady,â€ answered Cedric; â€œthine is the
hard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an
idle and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and with
him attend the banquet of John of Anjou.â€

He went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned
the principal events. Immediately upon retiring from the castle, the
Saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the
bustle which attended their doing so, that Cedric, for the first time,
cast his eyes upon the deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned from
the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a
pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.

â€œThe gyves!â€ he said, â€œthe gyves!--Oswald--Hundibert!--Dogs and
villains!--why leave ye the knave unfettered?â€

Without daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with
a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. He submitted to the
operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful
look at his master, he said, â€œThis comes of loving your flesh and blood
better than mine own.â€

â€œTo horse, and forward!â€ said Cedric.

â€œIt is indeed full time,â€ said the noble Athelstane; â€œfor, if we
ride not the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoffâ€™s preparations for a
rere-supper [25] will be altogether spoiled.â€

The travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St
Witholdâ€™s before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot, himself of
ancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and
exuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late,
or rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host
the next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection.

As the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened
somewhat alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people of Europe, were most
addicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions
can be traced most of those notions upon such subjects, still to be
found among our popular antiquities. For the Normans being a mixed race,
and better informed according to the information of the times, had lost
most of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought
from Scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such
topics.

In the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired
by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which,
sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the
gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro,
seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.

â€œI like not that music, father Cedric,â€ said Athelstane; for by this
title of respect he was accustomed to address him.

â€œNor I either, uncle,â€ said Wamba; â€œI greatly fear we shall have to pay
the piper.â€

â€œIn my mind,â€ said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbotâ€™s good
ale (for Burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a
favourable impression,--â€œin my mind we had better turn back, and abide
with the Abbot until the afternoon. It is unlucky to travel where your
path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have
eaten your next meal.â€

â€œAway!â€ said Cedric, impatiently; â€œthe day is already too short for
our journey. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runaway slave
Gurth, a useless fugitive like its master.â€

So saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the
interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor Fangs--for
Fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen
expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way,
rejoicing at his reappearance. The javelin inflicted a wound upon the
animalâ€™s shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and
Fangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurthâ€™s heart
swelled within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful
adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself
received. Having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes,
he said to Wamba, who, seeing his masterâ€™s ill humour had prudently
retreated to the rear, â€œI pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes
with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will
not let me help myself one way or another.â€

Wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for
some time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence. At length he
could repress his feelings no longer.

â€œFriend Wamba,â€ said he, â€œof all those who are fools enough to serve
Cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to
him. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear
will Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the head from me--he may
scourge me--he may load me with irons--but henceforth he shall never
compel me either to love or to obey him. Go to him, then, and tell him
that Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.â€

â€œAssuredly,â€ said Wamba, â€œfool as I am, I shall not do your foolâ€™s
errand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou
knowest he does not always miss his mark.â€

â€œI care not,â€ replied Gurth, â€œhow soon he makes a mark of me. Yesterday
he left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day he has striven to
kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me
kindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold, St Edward the Confessor,
and every other Saxon saint in the calendar,â€ (for Cedric never swore
by any that was not of Saxon lineage, and all his household had the same
limited devotion,) â€œI will never forgive him!â€

â€œTo my thinking now,â€ said the Jester, who was frequently wont to act
as peace-maker in the family, â€œour master did not propose to hurt Fangs,
but only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups,
as thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have done,
but Fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch,
which I will be bound to heal with a pennyâ€™s breadth of tar.â€

â€œIf I thought so,â€ said Gurth--â€œif I could but think so--but no--I saw
the javelin was well aimed--I heard it whizz through the air with all
the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it
had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark.
By the hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!â€

And the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts
of the Jester could again induce him to break.

Meanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed
together on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal
family, on the feuds and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the
chance which there was that the oppressed Saxons might be able to
free themselves from the yoke of the Normans, or at least to elevate
themselves into national consequence and independence, during the civil
convulsions which were likely to ensue. On this subject Cedric was all
animation. The restoration of the independence of his race was the idol
of his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness
and the interests of his own son. But, in order to achieve this great
revolution in favour of the native English, it was necessary that they
should be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head.
The necessity of choosing their chief from the Saxon blood-royal was not
only evident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those
whom Cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes. Athelstane
had this quality at least; and though he had few mental accomplishments
or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a goodly person,
was no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises, and seemed
willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than himself.
Above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be
good-natured. But whatever pretensions Athelstane had to be considered
as head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed
to prefer to the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her descent from
Alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom,
courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed
countrymen.

It would have been no difficult thing for Cedric, had he been so
disposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as
formidable at least as any of the others. To counterbalance their royal
descent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted
attachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of The Saxon,
and his birth was inferior to none, excepting only that of Athelstane
and his ward. These qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest
shade of selfishness; and, instead of dividing yet farther his weakened
nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of
Cedricâ€™s plan to extinguish that which already existed, by promoting a
marriage betwixt Rowena and Athelstane. An obstacle occurred to this his
favourite project, in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and
hence the original cause of the banishment of Wilfred from the house of
his father.

This stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfredâ€™s
absence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he was
disappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the
mode in which his ward had been educated. Cedric, to whom the name of
Alfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of
that great monarch with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps, was
in those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. Rowenaâ€™s will had
been in almost all cases a law to his household; and Cedric himself, as
if determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within
that little circle at least, seemed to take a pride in acting as the
first of her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise not only of free
will, but despotic authority, Rowena was, by her previous education,
disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her
affections, or dispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to
assert her independence in a case in which even those females who have
been trained up to obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to
dispute the authority of guardians and parents. The opinions which she
felt strongly, she avowed boldly; and Cedric, who could not free himself
from his habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally at a loss how
to enforce his authority of guardian.

It was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a
visionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered
his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned,
could it have been achieved. Without attempting to conceal her avowed
preference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured
knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than
share a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now
began, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly
to detest.

Nevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of womenâ€™s constancy was far from
strong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the
proposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important
service to the Saxon cause. The sudden and romantic appearance of his
son in the lists at Ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a deathâ€™s
blow to his hopes. His paternal affection, it is true, had for an
instant gained the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had
returned in full force, and under their joint operation, he was now bent
upon making a determined effort for the union of Athelstane and Rowena,
together with expediting those other measures which seemed necessary to
forward the restoration of Saxon independence.

On this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without
having reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur, that he
should have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an
action. Athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and loved to have
his ears tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right
by inheritance to homage and sovereignty. But his petty vanity was
sufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his
immediate attendants, and of the Saxons who approached him. If he had
the courage to encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going
to seek it; and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by
Cedric concerning the claim of the Saxons to independence, and was still
more easily convinced of his own title to reign over them when that
independence should be attained, yet when the means of asserting these
rights came to be discussed, he was still â€œAthelstane the Unready,â€
 slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising. The warm and
impassioned exhortations of Cedric had as little effect upon his
impassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the water, which produce
a little sound and smoke, and are instantly extinguished.

If, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade,
or to hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his ward Rowena, he
received little more satisfaction from conferring with her. For, as his
presence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite
attendant upon the gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha failed not to
revenge both her mistress and herself, by recurring to the overthrow of
Athelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject which could greet
the ears of Cedric. To this sturdy Saxon, therefore, the dayâ€™s journey
was fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort; so that
he more than once internally cursed the tournament, and him who had
proclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever thinking of going
thither.

At noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a
woodland shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partake of some
provisions, with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter mule.
Their repast was a pretty long one; and these several interruptions
rendered it impossible for them to hope to reach Rotherwood without
travelling all night, a conviction which induced them to proceed on
their way at a more hasty pace than they had hitherto used.




CHAPTER XIX

     A train of armed men, some noble dame
     Escorting, (so their scatterâ€™d words discoverâ€™d,
     As unperceived I hung upon their rear,)
     Are close at hand, and mean to pass the night
     Within the castle.
     --Orra, a Tragedy

The travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were
about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the
number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair,
and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid
defiance to the feeble police of the period. From these rovers, however,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted
themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba
and Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester
and the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late
through the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and
character, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of
the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life,
were chiefly peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally
supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.

As the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated
cries for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence
they came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the
ground, beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish
fashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong
to the same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the
deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange
disaster.

To the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some
time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the
Old Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were coming
to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When he began
to come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York (for it
was our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired
a body-guard of six men at Ashby, together with mules for carrying the
litter of a sick friend. This party had undertaken to escort him as
far as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but having received
information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws
lying in wait in the woods before them, Isaacâ€™s mercenaries had not only
taken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore the
litter and left the Jew and his daughter without the means either of
defence or of retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the
banditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them.
â€œWould it but please your valours,â€ added Isaac, in a tone of deep
humiliation, â€œto permit the poor Jews to travel under your safeguard,
I swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred
upon a child of Israel since the days of our captivity, which shall be
more gratefully acknowledged.â€

â€œDog of a Jew!â€ said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty
kind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling
offences, â€œdost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at
the tilt-yard? Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost
list, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such
as thee, who rob all the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them
right honest folk.â€

Cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. â€œWe shall
do better,â€ said he, â€œto leave them two of our attendants and two horses
to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our strength
but little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and the aid of
those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those
runagates.â€

Rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so
near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca
suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the
attendants to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the
Oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowenaâ€™s
garment. Then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her
in the great name of the God whom they both worshipped, and by that
revelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai, in which they both believed,
that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward
under their safeguard. â€œIt is not for myself that I pray this favour,â€
 said Rebecca; â€œnor is it even for that poor old man. I know that to
wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with the
Christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the
desert, or in the field? But it is in the name of one dear to many,
and dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be
transported with care and tenderness under your protection. For, if evil
chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret
for denying that which I ask of you.â€

The noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it
double weight with the fair Saxon.

â€œThe man is old and feeble,â€ she said to her guardian, â€œthe maiden young
and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life--Jews though
they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity. Let them
unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the
serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for
the old man and his daughter.â€

Cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added
the condition, â€œthat they should travel in the rear of the whole party,
where Wamba,â€ he said, â€œmight attend them with his shield of boarâ€™s
brawn.â€

â€œI have left my shield in the tilt-yard,â€ answered the Jester, â€œas has
been the fate of many a better knight than myself.â€

Athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the
last day of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same
proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling
suitor, requested Rebecca to ride by her side.

â€œIt were not fit I should do so,â€ answered Rebecca, with proud humility,
â€œwhere my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.â€

By this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single
word â€œoutlawsâ€ rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach
of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth
was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed
upon the Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It was
so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of Wamba,
that Gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from
bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the
party.

The bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was
missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind
a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him
under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them
that Gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate
expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held
convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.

The path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to
admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began
to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken,
swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and Athelstane, who
were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at
this pass; but neither of them having had much practice in war, no
better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they
should hasten through the defile as fast as possible. Advancing,
therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a
part of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank,
and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and
ill-prepared condition, it was impossible to offer effectual resistance.
The shout of â€œA white dragon!--a white dragon!--Saint George for merry
England!â€ war-cries adopted by the assailants, as belonging to their
assumed character of Saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on
every side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which
seemed to multiply their numbers.

Both the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each
under circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant
that an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which,
taking better effect than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the
man against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far
successful, Cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his sword
at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that
his weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he
was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made
prisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who
crowded around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having
been seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could
draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.

The attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the
fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while
the Lady Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his
daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.

Of all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the
occasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. He
possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was
just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like
a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though
ineffectual attempt to succour his master. Finding himself overpowered,
the Jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the
thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, escaped from the scene
of action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found himself safe,
hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the
captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.

â€œI have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,â€ he said to himself,
â€œbut I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that
I have it.â€

As he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in
a low and cautious tone, â€œWamba!â€ and, at the same time, a dog, which he
recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. â€œGurth!â€ answered
Wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
him.

â€œWhat is the matter?â€ said he eagerly; â€œwhat mean these cries, and that
clashing of swords?â€

â€œOnly a trick of the times,â€ said Wamba; â€œthey are all prisoners.â€

â€œWho are prisoners?â€ exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.

â€œMy lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.â€

â€œIn the name of God!â€ said Gurth, â€œhow came they prisoners?--and to
whom?â€

â€œOur master was too ready to fight,â€ said the Jester; â€œand Athelstane
was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they are
prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all tumbled
about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
swine. And I would laugh at it,â€ said the honest Jester, â€œif I could for
weeping.â€ And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.

Gurthâ€™s countenance kindled--â€œWamba,â€ he said, â€œthou hast a weapon,
and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,--we are only two--but a
sudden attack from men of resolution will do much--follow me!â€

â€œWhither?--and for what purpose?â€ said the Jester.

â€œTo rescue Cedric.â€

â€œBut you have renounced his service but now,â€ said Wamba.

â€œThat,â€ said Gurth, â€œwas but while he was fortunate--follow me!â€

As the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his
appearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms,
Wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just
assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering
baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it
supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice
and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise Locksley
the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous
circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.

â€œWhat is the meaning of all this,â€ said he, â€œor who is it that rifle,
and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?â€

â€œYou may look at their cassocks close by,â€ said Wamba, â€œand see whether
they be thy childrenâ€™s coats or no--for they are as like thine own, as
one green pea-cod is to another.â€

â€œI will learn that presently,â€ answered Locksley; â€œand I charge ye, on
peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until
I have returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your
masters.--Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as possible.â€

So saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from
his cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch,
and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his
purposes of reconnoitring.

â€œShall we stand fast, Gurth?â€ said Wamba; â€œor shall we eâ€™en give him
leg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too
much in readiness, to be himself a true man.â€

â€œLet him be the devil,â€ said Gurth, â€œan he will. We can be no worse of
waiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have
given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.
Besides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst
men in the world to have to deal with.â€

The yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.

â€œFriend Gurth,â€ he said, â€œI have mingled among yon men, and have learnt
to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think,
no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their
prisoners. For three men to attempt them at this moment, were little
else than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such,
placed sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. But I
trust soon to gather such a force, as may act in defiance of all their
precautions; you are both servants, and, as I think, faithful servants,
of Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall
not want English hands to help him in this extremity. Come then with me,
until I gather more aid.â€

So saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the
jester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wambaâ€™s humour to
travel long in silence.

â€œI think,â€ said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still
carried, â€œthat I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that
not so long since as Christmas.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ said Gurth, â€œcould take it on my halidome, that I have heard
the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and
that the moon is not three days older since I did so.â€

â€œMine honest friends,â€ replied the yeoman, â€œwho, or what I am, is little
to the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have reason
to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And whether
I am known by one name or another--or whether I can draw a bow as well
or better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in
sunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern
you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.â€

â€œOur heads are in the lionâ€™s mouth,â€ said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth,
â€œget them out how we can.â€

â€œHush--be silent,â€ said Gurth. â€œOffend him not by thy folly, and I trust
sincerely that all will go well.â€




CHAPTER XX

     When autumn nights were long and drear,
     And forest walks were dark and dim,
     How sweetly on the pilgrimâ€™s ear
     Was wont to steal the hermitâ€™s hymn

     Devotion borrows Musicâ€™s tone,
     And Music took Devotionâ€™s wing;
     And, like the bird that hails the sun,
     They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.
     The Hermit of St Clementâ€™s Well

It was after three hoursâ€™ good walking that the servants of Cedric, with
their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in
the centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing
its twisted branches in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five
yeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked
to and fro in the moonlight shade.

Upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the
alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. Six
arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which
the travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised, was
welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and
fears of a rough reception at once subsided.

â€œWhere is the Miller?â€ was his first question.

â€œOn the road towards Rotherham.â€

â€œWith how many?â€ demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.

â€œWith six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.â€

â€œDevoutly spoken,â€ said Locksley; â€œand where is Allan-a-Dale?â€

â€œWalked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of
Jorvaulx.â€

â€œThat is well thought on also,â€ replied the Captain;--â€œand where is the
Friar?â€

â€œIn his cell.â€

â€œThither will I go,â€ said Locksley. â€œDisperse and seek your companions.
Collect what force you can, for thereâ€™s game afoot that must be hunted
hard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.--And stay,â€ he
added, â€œI have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole--Two of
you take the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of
Front-de-Boeuf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such
guise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither--Watch them
closely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force,
our honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do so.
Keep a close watch on them therefore; and dispatch one of your comrades,
the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout.â€

They promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on
their different errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two
companions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some
fear, pursued their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.

When they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the
reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well
suited to ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, â€œIf this be the
habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the
church the farther from God.--And by my coxcomb,â€ he added, â€œI think it
be even so--Hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in
the hermitage!â€

In fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent
of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was
the burden:--

     â€œCome, trowl the brown bowl to me,
     Bully boy, bully boy,
     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me:
     Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,
     Come, trowl the brown bowl to me.â€

â€œNow, that is not ill sung,â€ said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his
own flourishes to help out the chorus. â€œBut who, in the saintâ€™s name,
ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermitâ€™s
cell at midnight!â€

â€œMarry, that should I,â€ said Gurth, â€œfor the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst
is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk.
Men say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he
will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better
order.â€

While they were thus speaking, Locksleyâ€™s loud and repeated knocks had
at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. â€œBy my beads,â€ said the
hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, â€œhere come more benighted
guests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly
exercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and there be
those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which I
have been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three
short hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike alien to
my profession and my disposition.â€

â€œBase calumniators!â€ replied the knight; â€œI would I had the chastising
of them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their
enemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak
to through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.â€

â€œGet thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as
thy nature will permit,â€ said the hermit, â€œwhile I remove these pewter
flagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to
drown the clatter--for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady--strike into
the tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words--I
scarce know them myself.â€

So saying, he struck up a thundering â€œDe profundis clamaviâ€, under cover
of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the knight,
laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host
with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.

â€œWhat devilâ€™s matins are you after at this hour?â€ said a voice from
without.

â€œHeaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!â€ said the hermit, whose own noise,
and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents
which were tolerably familiar to him--â€œWend on your way, in the name of
God and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy
brother.â€

â€œMad priest,â€ answered the voice from without, â€œopen to Locksley!â€

â€œAllâ€™s safe--allâ€™s right,â€ said the hermit to his companion.

â€œBut who is he?â€ said the Black Knight; â€œit imports me much to know.â€

â€œWho is he?â€ answered the hermit; â€œI tell thee he is a friend.â€

â€œBut what friend?â€ answered the knight; â€œfor he may be friend to thee
and none of mine?â€

â€œWhat friend?â€ replied the hermit; â€œthat, now, is one of the questions
that is more easily asked than answered. What friend?--why, he is, now
that I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of a
while since.â€

â€œAy, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,â€ replied the knight,
â€œI doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it from its
hinges.â€

The dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the
commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice
of him who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they
scratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission.
The hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with his
two companions.

â€œWhy, hermit,â€ was the yeomanâ€™s first question as soon as he beheld the
knight, â€œwhat boon companion hast thou here?â€

â€œA brother of our order,â€ replied the friar, shaking his head; â€œwe have
been at our orisons all night.â€

â€œHe is a monk of the church militant, I think,â€ answered Locksley; â€œand
there be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down
the rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of our
merry men, whether clerk or layman.--But,â€ he added, taking him a step
aside, â€œart thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know?
Hast thou forgot our articles?â€

â€œNot know him!â€ replied the friar, boldly, â€œI know him as well as the
beggar knows his dish.â€

â€œAnd what is his name, then?â€ demanded Locksley.

â€œHis name,â€ said the hermit--â€œhis name is Sir Anthony of
Scrabelstone--as if I would drink with a man, and did not know his
name!â€

â€œThou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,â€ said the woodsman,
â€œand, I fear, prating more than enough too.â€

â€œGood yeoman,â€ said the knight, coming forward, â€œbe not wroth with my
merry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have
compelled from him if he had refused it.â€

â€œThou compel!â€ said the friar; â€œwait but till have changed this grey
gown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring twelve
upon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.â€

While he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close
black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a
cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. â€œI pray thee truss my
points,â€ said he to Wamba, â€œand thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy
labour.â€

â€œGramercy for thy sack,â€ said Wamba; â€œbut thinkâ€™st thou it is lawful
for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful
forester?â€

â€œNever fear,â€ said the hermit; â€œI will but confess the sins of my green
cloak to my greyfriarâ€™s frock, and all shall be well again.â€

â€œAmen!â€ answered the Jester; â€œa broadcloth penitent should have a
sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into
the bargain.â€

So saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the
endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the
doublet were then termed.

While they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart,
and addressed him thus:--â€œDeny it not, Sir Knight--you are he who
decided the victory to the advantage of the English against the
strangers on the second day of the tournament at Ashby.â€

â€œAnd what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?â€ replied the knight.

â€œI should in that case hold you,â€ replied the yeoman, â€œa friend to the
weaker party.â€

â€œSuch is the duty of a true knight at least,â€ replied the Black
Champion; â€œand I would not willingly that there were reason to think
otherwise of me.â€

â€œBut for my purpose,â€ said the yeoman, â€œthou shouldst be as well a
good Englishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of,
concerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially
that of a true-born native of England.â€

â€œYou can speak to no one,â€ replied the knight, â€œto whom England, and the
life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.â€

â€œI would willingly believe so,â€ said the woodsman, â€œfor never had this
country such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and
I will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou beâ€™st really
that which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band
of villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made
themselves master of the person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric
the Saxon, together with his ward, and his friend Athelstane of
Coningsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest,
called Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and a good
Englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?â€

â€œI am bound by my vow to do so,â€ replied the knight; â€œbut I would
willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?â€

â€œI am,â€ said the forester, â€œa nameless man; but I am the friend of my
country, and of my countryâ€™s friends--With this account of me you must
for the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you yourself
desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word, when
pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.â€

â€œI willingly believe it,â€ said the knight; â€œI have been accustomed
to study menâ€™s countenances, and I can read in thine honesty and
resolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid
thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I trust
we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.â€

â€œSo,â€ said Wamba to Gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the
Jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--â€œSo we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.â€

â€œHold thy peace, Wamba,â€ said Gurth; â€œit may all be as thou dost guess;
but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to
set at liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have
religion enough to refuse the foul fiendâ€™s offer, and bid him get behind
me.â€

The friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and
buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He
left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the
door, deposited the key under the threshold.

â€œArt thou in condition to do good service, friar,â€ said Locksley, â€œor
does the brown bowl still run in thy head?â€

â€œNot more than a drought of St Dunstanâ€™s fountain will allay,â€ answered
the priest; â€œsomething there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of
instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.â€

So saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of
the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white
moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the
spring.

â€œWhen didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of
Copmanhurst?â€ said the Black Knight.

â€œNever since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal
vent,â€ replied the friar, â€œand so left me nothing to drink but my
patronâ€™s bounty here.â€

Then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them
all marks of the midnight revel.

Thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan
round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,
exclaiming at the same time, â€œWhere be those false ravishers, who carry
off wenches against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if I
am not man enough for a dozen of them.â€

â€œSwearest thou, Holy Clerk?â€ said the Black Knight.

â€œClerk me no Clerks,â€ replied the transformed priest; â€œby Saint George
and the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my
back--When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo
a lass, with any blithe forester in the West Riding.â€

â€œCome on, Jack Priest,â€ said Locksley, â€œand be silent; thou art as noisy
as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone to
bed.--Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it--I say, come
on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we
are to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.â€

â€œWhat! is it Front-de-Boeuf,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œwho has stopt on
the kingâ€™s highway the kingâ€™s liege subjects?--Is he turned thief and
oppressor?â€

â€œOppressor he ever was,â€ said Locksley.

â€œAnd for thief,â€ said the priest, â€œI doubt if ever he were even half so
honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.â€

â€œMove on, priest, and be silent,â€ said the yeoman; â€œit were better you
led the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left
unsaid, both in decency and prudence.â€




CHAPTER XXI

     Alas, how many hours and years have past,
     Since human forms have round this table sate,
     Or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleamâ€™d!
     Methinks, I hear the sound of time long passâ€™d
     Still murmuring oâ€™er us, in the lofty void
     Of these dark arches, like the lingâ€™ring voices
     Of those who long within their graves have slept.
     Orra, a Tragedy

While these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his companions,
the armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives
along towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison
them. But darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but
imperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to make several
long halts, and once or twice to return on their road to resume the
direction which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had dawned upon
them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right
path. But confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved
rapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between
the two leaders of the banditti.

â€œIt is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,â€ said the Templar to
De Bracy, â€œin order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou art
next, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.â€

â€œI have thought better of it,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI will not leave thee
till the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-Boeufâ€™s castle. There
will I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that
she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which I
have been guilty.â€

â€œAnd what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?â€ replied the Knight
Templar.

â€œThat concerns thee nothing,â€ answered his companion.

â€œI would hope, however, Sir Knight,â€ said the Templar, â€œthat this
alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable
meaning, such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?â€

â€œMy thoughts are my own,â€ answered De Bracy; â€œthe fiend laughs, they
say, when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to spit fire
and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from following
his bent.â€

â€œOr the leader of a Free Company,â€ answered the Templar, â€œfrom dreading
at the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all
mankind.â€

â€œThis is unprofitable and perilous recrimination,â€ answered De Bracy;
â€œsuffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I will
not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I
have run such risks.â€

â€œPsha,â€ replied the Templar, â€œwhat hast thou to fear?--Thou knowest the
vows of our order.â€

â€œRight well,â€ said De Bracy, â€œand also how they are kept. Come,
Sir Templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in
Palestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your
conscience.â€

â€œHear the truth, then,â€ said the Templar; â€œI care not for your blue-eyed
beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better mate.â€

â€œWhat! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?â€ said De Bracy.

â€œNo, Sir Knight,â€ said the Templar, haughtily. â€œTo the waiting-woman
will I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine
own.â€

â€œBy the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!â€ said De Bracy.

â€œAnd if I do,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œwho shall gainsay me?â€

â€œNo one that I know,â€ said De Bracy, â€œunless it be your vow of celibacy,
or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.â€

â€œFor my vow,â€ said the Templar, â€œour Grand Master hath granted me a
dispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred
Saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl
at her first confession upon Good Friday eve.â€

â€œThou knowest best thine own privileges,â€ said De Bracy. â€œYet, I would
have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurerâ€™s money bags,
than on the black eyes of the daughter.â€

â€œI can admire both,â€ answered the Templar; â€œbesides, the old Jew is but
half-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-Boeuf, who will not
lend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I
can term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on
the lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift,
thou wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not?--Thou hast
nothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.â€

â€œNo,â€ replied De Bracy, â€œI will remain beside my prize. What thou
sayst is passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by
the dispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the
slaughter of three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a free
pardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.â€

While this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring out
of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. â€œYou
should be Englishmen,â€ said he; â€œand yet, sacred Heaven! you prey
upon your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my
neighbours, and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours
have reason to be otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye
who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for I
have pitied their miseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic
nobles. What, then, would you have of me? or in what can this violence
serve ye?--Ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you
imitate them in their very dumbness?â€

It was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too
many good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either
by his wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along,
travelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge
trees, arose Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf. It was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a
donjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of
inferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard. Around the
exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring
rivulet. Front-de-Boeuf, whose character placed him often at feud with
his enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his
castle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at
every angle. The access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through
an arched barbican, or outwork, which was terminated and defended by a
small turret at each corner.

Cedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-Boeufâ€™s castle raise their
grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the
wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly
concerning the cause of his misfortune.

â€œI did injustice,â€ he said, â€œto the thieves and outlaws of these woods,
when I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as
justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening
wolves of France. Tell me, dogs--is it my life or my wealth that your
master aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble
Athelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony
of our race?--Put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking
our lives, as you began with our liberties. If the Saxon Cedric cannot
rescue England, he is willing to die for her. Tell your tyrannical
master, I do only beseech him to dismiss the Lady Rowena in honour and
safety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die
all who dare fight in her cause.â€

The attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and
they now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn
three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall
upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit
them. The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were
conducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of
which none but Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had
the descendant of the Confessor much time to do justice to the good
cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to
understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from
Rowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a
large room, which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those
refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most
ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.

The Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with
courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to
a distant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on
Rebecca, in spite of her fatherâ€™s entreaties, who offered even money,
in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with
him. â€œBase unbeliever,â€ answered one of his guards, â€œwhen thou hast seen
thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.â€ And, without
farther discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off in a different
direction from the other prisoners. The domestics, after being carefully
searched and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle;
and Rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the
attendance of her handmaiden Elgitha.

The apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them
we turn our first attention, although at present used as a sort of
guard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now
abandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other
additions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial
residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was
supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that
higher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced into
architecture.

Cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the
past and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served,
instead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing
save the inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel
even this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by
Cedricâ€™s animated and impassioned appeal to him.

â€œYes,â€ said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing
himself to Athelstane, â€œit was in this very hall that my father feasted
with Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate
Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had united themselves
to the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold returned the
magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. Oft have
I heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of Tosti was
admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of
noble Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around their
monarch.â€

â€œI hope,â€ said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friendâ€™s
discourse, â€œthey will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at
noon--we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and
I never have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after
dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.â€

Cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional
observation of his friend.

â€œThe envoy of Tosti,â€ he said, â€œmoved up the hall, undismayed by the
frowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance
before the throne of King Harold.

â€œâ€˜What terms,â€™ he said, â€˜Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if
he should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?â€™

â€œâ€˜A brotherâ€™s love,â€™ cried the generous Harold, â€˜and the fair earldom of
Northumberland.â€™

â€œâ€˜But should Tosti accept these terms,â€™ continued the envoy, â€˜what lands
shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of Norway?â€™

â€œâ€˜Seven feet of English ground,â€™ answered Harold, fiercely, â€˜or, as
Hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches
more.â€™

â€œThe hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to
the Norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English
territory.â€

â€œI could have pledged him with all my soul,â€ said Athelstane, â€œfor my
tongue cleaves to my palate.â€

â€œThe baffled envoy,â€ continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his tale,
though it interested not the listener, â€œretreated, to carry to Tosti and
his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was then that
the distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the Derwent,
[26] beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying the most
undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell, with ten
thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought that upon
the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the
Saxon banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and impelling
them to the fatal shores of Sussex?--Who would have thought that Harold,
within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom,
than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the Norwegian
invader?--Who would have thought that you, noble Athelstane--that you,
descended of Haroldâ€™s blood, and that I, whose father was not the worst
defender of the Saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile Norman, in
the very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival?â€

â€œIt is sad enough,â€ replied Athelstane; â€œbut I trust they will hold us
to a moderate ransom--At any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve
us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations
for serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by
the sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.â€

â€œIt may be so,â€ answered Cedric; â€œbut I cannot look on that stained
lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern
the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was wrought, my
noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or
of staining it--The pride of Wolfgangerâ€™s father brought an artist from
Normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that
breaks the golden light of Godâ€™s blessed day into so many fantastic
hues. The foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient,
ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. He
returned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the
wealth and the simplicity of the Saxon nobles--a folly, oh, Athelstane,
foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of Hengist
and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. We
made these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants;
we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest
simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported
themselves, and we became enervated by Norman arts long ere we fell
under Norman arms. Far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and
liberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of which hath delivered
us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!â€

â€œI should,â€ replied Athelstane, â€œhold very humble diet a luxury at
present; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so truly
in mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very
hour of dinner.â€

â€œIt is time lost,â€ muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, â€œto speak
to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of
Hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save
to fill, to swill, and to call for more.--Alas!â€ said he, looking at
Athelstane with compassion, â€œthat so dull a spirit should be lodged in
so goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of
England should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed,
her nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which
is torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane,
and I myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have
been made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might
bring to the usurped power of his nation?â€

While the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of
their prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod
of office. This important person advanced into the chamber with a grave
pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered
with dishes, the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant
compensation to Athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone.
The persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.

â€œWhat mummery is this?â€ said Cedric; â€œthink you that we are ignorant
whose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master?
Tell him,â€ he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open
a negotiation for his freedom,--â€œTell your master, Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf, that we know no reason he can have for withholding our
liberty, excepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense.
Tell him that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we
should do to that of a literal robber. Let him name the ransom at which
he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is
suited to our means.â€ The sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.

â€œAnd tell Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,â€ said Athelstane, â€œthat I send
him my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or
horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;
which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,
venture to refuse or to delay.â€

â€œI shall deliver to the knight your defiance,â€ answered the sewer;
â€œmeanwhile I leave you to your food.â€

The challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a
large mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added
to a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold
defiance it contained. Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric
as an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose
previous indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for
Athelstaneâ€™s descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially
shook hands with him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat
grieved when Athelstane observed, â€œthat he would fight a dozen such men
as Front-de-Boeuf, if, by so doing, he could hasten his departure from
a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage.â€
 Notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of
sensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon
showed, that if the distresses of his country could banish the
recollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were
the victuals put there, than he proved that the appetite of his Saxon
ancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.

The captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their
attention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the
blast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times,
with as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted castle
by the destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers, barbican and
battlement, were to roll off like a morning vapour. The Saxons started
from the table, and hastened to the window. But their curiosity was
disappointed; for these outlets only looked upon the court of the
castle, and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The summons,
however, seemed of importance, for a considerable degree of bustle
instantly took place in the castle.




CHAPTER XXII

     My daughter--O my ducats--O my daughter!
     ------O my Christian ducats!
     Justice--the Law--my ducats, and my daughter!
     --Merchant of Venice

Leaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their
ungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of their
half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more severe
imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily thrust into
a dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep beneath
the level of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even the moat
itself. The only light was received through one or two loop-holes far
above the reach of the captiveâ€™s hand. These apertures admitted, even
at mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was changed for utter
darkness long before the rest of the castle had lost the blessing of
day. Chains and shackles, which had been the portion of former captives,
from whom active exertions to escape had been apprehended, hung rusted
and empty on the walls of the prison, and in the rings of one of those
sets of fetters there remained two mouldering bones, which seemed to
have been once those of the human leg, as if some prisoner had been left
not only to perish there, but to be consumed to a skeleton.

At one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the
top of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured
with rust.

The whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart
than that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the
imminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by
terrors, of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent. The lovers
of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the pursuit of
the greyhounds, than when she is struggling in their fangs. [27]

And thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their
fear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for
every effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no
aggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it that surprise
which is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the first
time that Isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous. He had
therefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might again,
as formerly, be delivered as a prey from the fowler. Above all, he had
upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that unbending
resolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known to submit
to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict upon them,
rather than gratify their oppressors by granting their demands.

In this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected
beneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a
corner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and
beard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken light,
would have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated painter
existed at the period. The Jew remained, without altering his position,
for nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were heard on the
dungeon stair. The bolts screamed as they were withdrawn--the hinges
creaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, followed by
the two Saracen slaves of the Templar, entered the prison.

Front-de-Boeuf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in
public war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no
means of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his
character, and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant
passions of the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed,
would, on features of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and
veneration due to the marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar
case of Front-de-Boeuf, they only added to the ferocity of his
countenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This
formidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet, fitted close to his
body, which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He
had no weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt, which served to
counterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his
right side.

The black slaves who attended Front-de-Boeuf were stripped of their
gorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen,
their sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers
when about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had
in his hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they
stopt at the door until Front-de-Boeuf himself carefully locked and
double-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up
the apartment towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye fixed, as if
he wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to
fascinate their prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant
eye of Front-de-Boeuf possessed some portion of that supposed power over
his unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his
eyes fixed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that his
frame seemed literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size while
encountering the fierce Normanâ€™s fixed and baleful gaze. The unhappy
Isaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the obeisance
which his terror dictated, but he could not even doff his cap, or utter
any word of supplication; so strongly was he agitated by the conviction
that tortures and death were impending over him.

On the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate
in magnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when
about to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps
of the corner in which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled
himself up into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of
the slaves to approach. The black satellite came forward accordingly,
and, producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several
weights, he laid them at the feet of Front-de-Boeuf, and again retired
to the respectful distance, at which his companion had already taken his
station.

The motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended over
their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty. Front-de-Boeuf
himself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated captive.

â€œMost accursed dog of an accursed race,â€ he said, awaking with his deep
and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, â€œseest thou
these scales?â€

The unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.

â€œIn these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,â€ said the relentless
Baron, â€œa thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of
the Tower of London.â€

â€œHoly Abraham!â€ returned the Jew, finding voice through the very
extremity of his danger, â€œheard man ever such a demand?--Who ever
heard, even in a minstrelâ€™s tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds
of silver?--What human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such
a mass of treasure?--Not within the walls of York, ransack my house
and that of all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of
silver that thou speakest of.â€

â€œI am reasonable,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf, â€œand if silver be scant, I
refuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of
silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as
thy heart has never even conceived.â€

â€œHave mercy on me, noble knight!â€ exclaimed Isaac; â€œI am old, and poor,
and helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me--It is a poor deed to
crush a worm.â€

â€œOld thou mayst be,â€ replied the knight; â€œmore shame to their folly who
have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery--Feeble thou mayst
be, for when had a Jew either heart or hand--But rich it is well known
thou art.â€

â€œI swear to you, noble knight,â€ said the Jew â€œby all which I believe,
and by all which we believe in common---â€

â€œPerjure not thyself,â€ said the Norman, interrupting him, â€œand let not
thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered
the fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy
terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy
tribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the
gospel which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to
bind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This
dungeon is no place for trifling. Prisoners ten thousand times more
distinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate
hath never been known! But for thee is reserved a long and lingering
death, to which theirs were luxury.â€

He again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them
apart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where
perhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced from
their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask
of oil. While the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the other
disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already
mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow.

â€œSeest thou, Isaac,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthe range of iron bars above
the glowing charcoal?-- [28] on that warm couch thou shalt lie, stripped
of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One of these
slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other shall
anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.--Now,
choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds
of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option.â€

â€œIt is impossible,â€ exclaimed the miserable Jew--â€œit is impossible that
your purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a heart
capable of exercising such cruelty!â€

â€œTrust not to that, Isaac,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œit were a fatal error.
Dost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands
of my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire,
will blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single
wretched Jew?--or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have
neither law, country, nor conscience, but their masterâ€™s will--who use
the poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest
wink--thinkest thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even
understand the language in which it is asked?--Be wise, old man;
discharge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the
hands of a Christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou
hast practised on those of his religion. Thy cunning may soon swell
out once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor medicine can
restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once stretched on these
bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that at such rate thou
canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of which few have returned
to tell. I waste no more words with thee--choose between thy dross and
thy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be.â€

â€œSo may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me,â€
 said Isaac, â€œI cannot make the choice, because I have not the means of
satisfying your exorbitant demand!â€

â€œSeize him and strip him, slaves,â€ said the knight, â€œand let the fathers
of his race assist him if they can.â€

The assistants, taking their directions more from the Baronâ€™s eye and
his hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the
unfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him
between them, waited the hard-hearted Baronâ€™s farther signal. The
unhappy Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-Boeuf, in
hope of discovering some symptoms of relenting; but that of the Baron
exhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had
been the prelude to his cruelty; and the savage eyes of the Saracens,
rolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister
expression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil,
evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the
approaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents.
The Jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently
to be stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentorâ€™s relenting, his
resolution gave way.

â€œI will pay,â€ he said, â€œthe thousand pounds of silver--That is,â€ he
added, after a momentâ€™s pause, â€œI will pay it with the help of my
brethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere
I make up so unheard-of a sum.--When and where must it be delivered?â€

â€œHere,â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf, â€œhere it must be delivered--weighed it
must be--weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor.--Thinkest
thou I will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?â€

â€œAnd what is to be my surety,â€ said the Jew, â€œthat I shall be at liberty
after this ransom is paid?â€

â€œThe word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,â€ answered
Front-de-Boeuf; â€œthe faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold
and silver of thee and all thy tribe.â€

â€œI crave pardon, noble lord,â€ said Isaac timidly, â€œbut wherefore should
I rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine?â€

â€œBecause thou canst not help it, Jew,â€ said the knight, sternly. â€œWert
thou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan of
thy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the
pledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at
advantage, nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant
thee liberty.â€

The Jew groaned deeply.--â€œGrant me,â€ he said, â€œat least with my own
liberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me as
a Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me
by the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they may
contribute in some sort to my ransom.â€

â€œIf thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œtheir
ransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own concerns,
Jew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.â€

â€œI am, then,â€ said Isaac, â€œonly to be set at liberty, together with mine
wounded friend?â€

â€œShall I twice recommend it,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œto a son of Israel,
to meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone?--Since
thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy
ransom, and that at a short day.â€

â€œYet hear me,â€ said the Jew--â€œfor the sake of that very wealth which
thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy---â€ Here he stopt short,
afraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-Boeuf only laughed,
and himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.

â€œAt the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it
out--I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser,
even when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when
thou didst invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling thee
a usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.â€

â€œI swear by the Talmud,â€ said the Jew, â€œthat your valour has been
misled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own
chamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of payment
was due at the Passover.â€

â€œI care not what he did,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œthe question is, when
shall I have mine own?--when shall I have the shekels, Isaac?â€

â€œLet my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,â€ answered Isaac, â€œwith your
safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the
treasure---â€ Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a few
seconds,--â€œThe treasure shall be told down on this very floor.â€

â€œThy daughter!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, as if surprised,--â€œBy heavens,
Isaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed
girl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir
Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of
the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.â€

The yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the
very vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they let
go their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to throw
himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-Boeuf.

â€œTake all that you have asked,â€ said he, â€œSir Knight--take ten times
more--reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt,--nay, pierce
me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter,
deliver her in safety and honour!--As thou art born of woman, spare the
honour of a helpless maiden--She is the image of my deceased Rachel,
she is the last of six pledges of her love--Will you deprive a widowed
husband of his sole remaining comfort?--Will you reduce a father to wish
that his only living child were laid beside her dead mother, in the tomb
of our fathers?â€

â€œI would,â€ said the Norman, somewhat relenting, â€œthat I had known
of this before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their
moneybags.â€

â€œThink not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,â€ said Isaac, eager to
improve the moment of apparent sympathy; â€œthe hunted fox, the tortured
wildcat loves its young--the despised and persecuted race of Abraham
love their children!â€

â€œBe it so,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œI will believe it in future, Isaac,
for thy very sake--but it aids us not now, I cannot help what has
happened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in arms,
nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides, why
shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became
Bois-Guilbertâ€™s booty?â€

â€œThere will, there must!â€ exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony;
â€œwhen did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to
women!â€

â€œDog of an infidel,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, with sparkling eyes, and not
sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion,
â€œblaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought
instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy
Jewish throat!â€

â€œRobber and villain!â€ said the Jew, retorting the insults of his
oppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it
impossible to bridle, â€œI will pay thee nothing--not one silver penny
will I pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and
honour!â€

â€œArt thou in thy senses, Israelite?â€ said the Norman, sternly--â€œhas thy
flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil?â€

â€œI care not!â€ said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection;
â€œdo thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a
thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver
will I give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious
throat--no, not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to
save thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my
life if thou wilt, and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to
disappoint the Christian.â€

â€œWe shall see that,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œfor by the blessed rood,
which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the
extremities of fire and steel!--Strip him, slaves, and chain him down
upon the bars.â€

In spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had
already torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to
disrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle,
penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately
after loud voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
Unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage
Baron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaacâ€™s garment, and, quitting
the dungeon with his attendants, he left the Jew to thank God for
his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughterâ€™s captivity,
and probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove
strongest.




CHAPTER XXIII

     Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
     Can no way change you to a milder form,
     Iâ€™ll woo you, like a soldier, at armsâ€™ end,
     And love you â€˜gainst the nature of love, force you.
     --Two Gentlemen of Verona

The apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted
up with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being
placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not
offered to the other prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-Boeuf, for whom
it had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect
had impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it.
The tapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others
was tarnished and faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and
decayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of
the castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation
of the Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her fate,
until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts
which each of them was to perform. This had been settled in a council
held by Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after
a long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each
insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious
enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy
prisoners.

It was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose
advantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute
his views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.

The interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his
confederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person
with all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were
now flung aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint
tresses down his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his
doublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured
it, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered
and embossed with gold work. We have already noticed the extravagant
fashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of Maurice de
Bracyâ€™s might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the gayest,
being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was the dress
of a gallant of the period; and, in the present instance, that effect
was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose
manners partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a
soldier.

He saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden
broach, representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With
this, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained
her standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned
to conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the
proffered compliment, and replied, â€œIf I be in the presence of
my jailor, Sir Knight--nor will circumstances allow me to think
otherwise--it best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she
learns her doom.â€

â€œAlas! fair Rowena,â€ returned De Bracy, â€œyou are in presence of your
captive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy
must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.â€

â€œI know you not, sir,â€ said the lady, drawing herself up with all the
pride of offended rank and beauty; â€œI know you not--and the insolent
familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms
no apology for the violence of a robber.â€

â€œTo thyself, fair maid,â€ answered De Bracy, in his former tone--â€œto
thine own charms be ascribed whateâ€™er I have done which passed the
respect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar
of my eyes.â€

â€œI repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man
wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence
of an unprotected lady.â€

â€œThat I am unknown to you,â€ said De Bracy, â€œis indeed my misfortune;
yet let me hope that De Bracyâ€™s name has not been always unspoken, when
minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the
lists or in the battle-field.â€

â€œTo heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,â€
 replied Rowena, â€œmore suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and
tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the
memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man,
followed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden,
transported against her will to the castle of a robber?â€

â€œYou are unjust, Lady Rowena,â€ said the knight, biting his lips in
some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of
affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; â€œyourself free from
passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although
caused by your own beauty.â€

â€œI pray you, Sir Knight,â€ said Rowena, â€œto cease a language so commonly
used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or
nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such
commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might
last from hence to Christmas.â€

â€œProud damsel,â€ said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style
procured him nothing but contempt--â€œproud damsel, thou shalt be as
proudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to
your hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for
thy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in
courtly language.â€

â€œCourtesy of tongue,â€ said Rowena, â€œwhen it is used to veil churlishness
of deed, is but a knightâ€™s girdle around the breast of a base clown. I
wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you--more it were for your
honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than
to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and
demeanour.â€

â€œYou counsel well, lady,â€ said the Norman; â€œand in the bold language
which best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave
this castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracyâ€™s wife. I am
not wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble
scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he
distinguishes by the offer of his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and thou
art the fitter to be my wife. By what other means couldst thou be raised
to high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance? How else
wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where
Saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy seat,
honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England that is
distinguished by beauty, or dignified by power?â€

â€œSir Knight,â€ replied Rowena, â€œthe grange which you contemn hath been
my shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it--should that
day ever arrive--it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the
dwelling and manners in which I have been brought up.â€

â€œI guess your meaning, lady,â€ said De Bracy, â€œthough you may think it
lies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard Coeur
de Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe,
his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed
as the bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while he
touched this string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion
so childish and so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in my power,
and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within
the castle to Front-de-Boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than
mine.â€

â€œWilfred here?â€ said Rowena, in disdain; â€œthat is as true as that
Front-de-Boeuf is his rival.â€

De Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.

â€œWert thou really ignorant of this?â€ said he; â€œdidst thou not know
that Wilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?--a meet
conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the Holy
Sepulchre!â€ And he laughed scornfully.

â€œAnd if he is here,â€ said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of
indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she
could not suppress, â€œin what is he the rival of Front-de-Boeuf? or what
has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom,
according to the use of chivalry?â€

â€œRowena,â€ said De Bracy, â€œart thou, too, deceived by the common error of
thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own
charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth,
as well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-Boeuf, will push
from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of Ivanhoe,
as readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him
by some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded
champion shall have nothing to fear from Front-de-Boeuf, whom else thou
mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion.â€

â€œSave him, for the love of Heaven!â€ said Rowena, her firmness giving way
under terror for her loverâ€™s impending fate.

â€œI can--I will--it is my purpose,â€ said De Bracy; â€œfor, when Rowena
consents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare to put forth
a violent hand upon her kinsman--the son of her guardian--the companion
of her youth? But it is thy love must buy his protection. I am not
romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one
who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. Use
thine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,--refuse to employ
it, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom.â€

â€œThy language,â€ answered Rowena, â€œhath in its indifferent bluntness
something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to
express. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so
great.â€

â€œFlatter thyself, then, with that belief,â€ said De Bracy, â€œuntil
time shall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle--thy
preferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-Boeuf and that which
Front-de-Boeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will
it cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to
silence his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-Boeuf afraid to
justify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong
draught--let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck
the pillow from his head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped
without the effusion of blood. Cedric also--â€

â€œAnd Cedric also,â€ said Rowena, repeating his words; â€œmy noble--my
generous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for
forgetting his fate even in that of his son!â€

â€œCedricâ€™s fate also depends upon thy determination,â€ said De Bracy; â€œand
I leave thee to form it.â€

Hitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with
undismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the
danger as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that which
physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild, timid,
and gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the
circumstances of her education. Accustomed to see the will of all, even
of Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with others,) give way before
her wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and self-confidence
which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in
which we move. She could scarce conceive the possibility of her will
being opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard.

Her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious
character, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted
her when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well
as that of her lover and her guardian; and when she found her will, the
slightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention,
now placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong, fierce, and
determined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved
to use it, she quailed before him.

After casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was
nowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised
her hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation
and sorrow. It was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such
extremity without feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though
he was yet more embarrassed than touched. He had, in truth, gone too
far to recede; and yet, in Rowenaâ€™s present condition, she could not be
acted on either by argument or threats. He paced the apartment to and
fro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now
hesitating concerning his own line of conduct.

If, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this
disconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair hopes
for which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of Prince
John and his jovial comrades? â€œAnd yet,â€ he said to himself, â€œI feel
myself ill framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look on so
fair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they
are drowned in tears. I would she had retained her original haughtiness
of disposition, or that I had a larger share of Front-de-Boeufâ€™s
thrice-tempered hardness of heart!â€

Agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be
comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the
excess of despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of
consolation De Bracy was interrupted by the horn, â€œhoarse-winded blowing
far and keen,â€ which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates
of the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and
of license. Of them all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the
interruption; for his conference with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a
point, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his
enterprise.

And here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof
than the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy
representation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. It
is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against
the crown the liberties of England were indebted for their existence,
should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of
excesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to those of
nature and humanity. But, alas! we have only to extract from the
industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected
from contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly
reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.

The description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the
cruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons and
lords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of the
excesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed.
â€œThey grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles; and when
they were built, they filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who
seized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them
into prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever
endured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet,
or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. They squeezed the
heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while
they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and
toads.â€ But it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing
the remainder of this description. [29]

As another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the
strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess Matilda,
though a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both Queen of
England, niece to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of Germany,
the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during
her early residence for education in England, to assume the veil of a
nun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the Norman
nobles. This excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of
England, as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit.
The assembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the
notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded; giving thus
an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that
disgraceful license by which that age was stained. It was a matter of
public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of King William,
his Norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no
law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered
Saxons of their lands and their goods, but invaded the honour of their
wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license; and hence
it was then common for matrons and maidens of noble families to assume
the veil, and take shelter in convents, not as called thither by the
vocation of God, but solely to preserve their honour from the unbridled
wickedness of man.

Such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public
declaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need add
nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have
detailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of
the Wardour MS.




CHAPTER XXIV

     Iâ€™ll woo her as the lion woos his bride.
     --Douglas

While the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the
castle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered
turret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and
on being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence
of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon rhyme, as if to
beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon
the floor. The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered, and scowled at
the fair Jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness,
when united with evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty.

â€œThou must up and away, old house-cricket,â€ said one of the men; â€œour
noble master commands it--Thou must eâ€™en leave this chamber to a fairer
guest.â€

â€œAy,â€ grumbled the hag, â€œeven thus is service requited. I have known
when my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of
saddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of
every groom such as thou.â€

â€œGood Dame Urfried,â€ said the other man, â€œstand not to reason on it,
but up and away. Lordsâ€™ hests must be listened to with a quick ear. Thou
hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou art now
the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren heath--thou
hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of
them--Come, amble off with thee.â€

â€œIll omens dog ye both!â€ said the old woman; â€œand a kennel be your
burying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if I
leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!â€

â€œAnswer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,â€ said the man, and
retired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose
presence she had been thus unwillingly forced.

â€œWhat devilâ€™s deed have they now in the wind?â€ said the old hag,
murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and
malignant glance at Rebecca; â€œbut it is easy to guess--Bright eyes,
black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his
black unguent--Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone
turret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of
five hundred fathoms beneath the earth.--Thou wilt have owls for thy
neighbours, fair one; and their screams will be heard as far, and as
much regarded, as thine own. Outlandish, too,â€ she said, marking the
dress and turban of Rebecca--â€œWhat country art thou of?--a Saracen?
or an Egyptian?--Why dost not answer?--thou canst weep, canst thou not
speak?â€

â€œBe not angry, good mother,â€ said Rebecca.

â€œThou needst say no more,â€ replied Urfried â€œmen know a fox by the train,
and a Jewess by her tongue.â€

â€œFor the sake of mercy,â€ said Rebecca, â€œtell me what I am to expect as
the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it
my life they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down
cheerfully.â€

â€œThy life, minion?â€ answered the sibyl; â€œwhat would taking thy life
pleasure them?--Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage shalt thou
have as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And shall
a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at me--I
was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-Boeuf, father of
this Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and his
seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber
to chamber--There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not
slippery with their blood. They died--they died every man; and ere their
bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become the prey
and the scorn of the conqueror!â€

â€œIs there no help?--Are there no means of escape?â€ said
Rebecca--â€œRichly, richly would I requite thine aid.â€

â€œThink not of it,â€ said the hag; â€œfrom hence there is no escape but
through the gates of death; and it is late, late,â€ she added, shaking
her grey head, â€œere these open to us--Yet it is comfort to think that we
leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. Fare
thee well, Jewess!--Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for thou
hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare thee well,
I say. My thread is spun out--thy task is yet to begin.â€

â€œStay! stay! for Heavenâ€™s sake!â€ said Rebecca; â€œstay, though it be to
curse and to revile me--thy presence is yet some protection.â€

â€œThe presence of the mother of God were no protection,â€ answered the old
woman. â€œThere she stands,â€ pointing to a rude image of the Virgin Mary,
â€œsee if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.â€

She left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of
sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their
habitual frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear
her curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty
she descended the turret-stair.

Rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of Rowena;
for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be
used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might
be preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess this advantage,
that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural
strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. Of
a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp
and wealth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she
witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not been able to
blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed.
Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca perpetually beheld,
amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads
of her people by a single hair. These reflections had tamed and brought
down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other
circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.

From her fatherâ€™s example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear
herself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not indeed
imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the
meanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by
which it was dictated; but she bore herself with a proud humility, as
if submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as
the daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the
consciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her
merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her
to aspire to.

Thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the
firmness necessary for acting under them. Her present situation required
all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.

Her first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes
either of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor
trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the
main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of
the turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single window opened
upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave Rebecca,
at first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no
communication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated
bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures,
at which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and
flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.

There was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong
reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters. Rebecca,
however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of Scripture to
the chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be
their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of Zion would be
one day called in with the fulness of the Gentiles. In the meanwhile,
all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment
and probation, and that it was their especial duty to suffer without
sinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune,
Rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to
meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.

The prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was
heard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened,
and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed
their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap,
pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he
held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest. In this guise,
as if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of which
he was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner; yet,
ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what
purpose had brought him thither, so that Rebecca, making an effort
upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already
unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to
proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his
avarice was to bespeak his favour.

â€œTake these,â€ she said, â€œgood friend, and for Godâ€™s sake be merciful
to me and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet are they
trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this
castle, free and uninjured.â€

â€œFair flower of Palestine,â€ replied the outlaw, â€œthese pearls are
orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are
brilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken
up this wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.â€

â€œDo not do yourself such wrong,â€ said Rebecca; â€œtake ransom, and have
mercy!--Gold will purchase you pleasure,--to misuse us, could only bring
thee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and
if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy
restoration to civil society--mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and
be placed beyond the necessity of committing more.â€

â€œIt is well spoken,â€ replied the outlaw in French, finding it difficult
probably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had opened
in that language; â€œbut know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy
father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to
convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. The
venerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from
him all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy
entreaty. The ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other
coin will I accept it.â€

â€œThou art no outlaw,â€ said Rebecca, in the same language in which he
addressed her; â€œno outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this
land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw, but
a Norman--a Norman, noble perhaps in birth--O, be so in thy actions, and
cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!â€

â€œAnd thou, who canst guess so truly,â€ said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
dropping the mantle from his face, â€œart no true daughter of Israel,
but in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an
outlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt
to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become
them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments.â€

â€œWhat wouldst thou have of me,â€ said Rebecca, â€œif not my wealth?--We
can have nought in common between us--you are a Christian--I am a
Jewess.--Our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and
the synagogue.â€

â€œIt were so, indeed,â€ replied the Templar, laughing; â€œwed with a Jewess?
â€˜Despardieux!â€™--Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! And know, besides,
sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to offer me
his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I could not
wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise than â€˜par
amoursâ€™, as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the cross of my
Holy Order.â€

â€œDarest thou appeal to it,â€ said Rebecca, â€œon an occasion like the
present?â€

â€œAnd if I do so,â€ said the Templar, â€œit concerns not thee, who art no
believer in the blessed sign of our salvation.â€

â€œI believe as my fathers taught,â€ said Rebecca; â€œand may God forgive my
belief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you appeal
without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are
about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a
man of religion?â€

â€œIt is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!â€ answered the
Templar; â€œbut, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices make
thee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on
the part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall
speedily be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the
wisest of monarchs, not his father, whose examples you must needs allow
are weighty, claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the
Temple of Zion have won by our zeal in its defence. The protectors of
Solomonâ€™s Temple may claim license by the example of Solomon.â€

â€œIf thou readest the Scripture,â€ said the Jewess, â€œand the lives of the
saints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime
is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and
necessary herbs.â€

The eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this reproof--â€œHearken,â€ he
said, â€œRebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my
language shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow
and spear--subject to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will I
abate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou
refusest to entreaty or necessity.â€

â€œStand back,â€ said Rebecca--â€œstand back, and hear me ere thou offerest
to commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed overpower for
God made women weak, and trusted their defence to manâ€™s generosity. But
I will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of Europe to
the other. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their
compassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory--each Chapter of thy Order,
shall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess. Those
who tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for having so
far dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of my
people.â€

â€œThou art keen-witted, Jewess,â€ replied the Templar, well aware of the
truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in
the most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as
he now prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had
followed upon it--â€œthou art sharp-witted,â€ he said; â€œbut loud must be
thy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this
castle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams
for help, die alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca.
Submit to thy fate--embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in
such state, that many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in
beauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the
Temple.â€

â€œSubmit to my fate!â€ said Rebecca--â€œand, sacred Heaven! to what
fate?--embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that
harbours such a villain?--THOU the best lance of the Templars!--Craven
knight!--forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.--The God of
Abrahamâ€™s promise hath opened an escape to his daughter--even from this
abyss of infamy!â€

As she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the
bartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the
parapet, with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous
depth below. Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she had
hitherto stood perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time
to intercept nor to stop her. As he offered to advance, she exclaimed,
â€œRemain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!--one
foot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall
be crushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that
court-yard, ere it become the victim of thy brutality!â€

As she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards
heaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final
plunge. The Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded
to pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. â€œCome
down,â€ he said, â€œrash girl!--I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will
offer thee no offence.â€

â€œI will not trust thee, Templar,â€ said Rebecca; â€œthou hast taught me
better how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next Preceptory
would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned
nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish maiden.â€

â€œYou do me injustice,â€ exclaimed the Templar fervently; â€œI swear to you
by the name which I bear--by the cross on my bosom--by the sword on my
side--by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do thee
no injury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy fatherâ€™s sake
forbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a
powerful one.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said Rebecca, â€œI know it but too well--dare I trust thee?â€

â€œMay my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,â€ said Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, â€œif thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a law,
many a commandment have I broken, but my word never.â€

â€œI will then trust thee,â€ said Rebecca, â€œthus far;â€ and she descended
from the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of
the embrasures, or â€œmachicollesâ€, as they were then called.--â€œHere,â€ she
said, â€œI take my stand. Remain where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt
to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that
the Jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with God, than her honour
to the Templar!â€

While Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded
so well with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her
looks, air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her
glance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so
instant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her
fate at her command, and could escape at will from infamy to death,
gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet
more brilliant fire to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud himself and
high-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so
commanding.

â€œLet there be peace between us, Rebecca,â€ he said.

â€œPeace, if thou wilt,â€ answered Rebecca--â€œPeace--but with this space
between.â€

â€œThou needst no longer fear me,â€ said Bois-Guilbert.

â€œI fear thee not,â€ replied she; â€œthanks to him that reared this dizzy
tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live--thanks to him,
and to the God of Israel!--I fear thee not.â€

â€œThou dost me injustice,â€ said the Templar; â€œby earth, sea, and sky,
thou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen me,
hard, selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and
on woman therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear
me, Rebecca--Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more
devoted to the lady of his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the
daughter of a petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a ruinous
tower, and an unproductive vineyard, and some few leagues of the barren
Landes of Bourdeaux, her name was known wherever deeds of arms were
done, known wider than that of many a ladyâ€™s that had a county for a
dowery.--Yes,â€ he continued, pacing up and down the little platform,
with an animation in which he seemed to lose all consciousness of
Rebeccaâ€™s presence--â€œYes, my deeds, my danger, my blood, made the name
of Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of Castile to that of
Byzantium. And how was I requited?--When I returned with my dear-bought
honours, purchased by toil and blood, I found her wedded to a Gascon
squire, whose name was never heard beyond the limits of his own paltry
domain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I revenge me of her
broken faith! But my vengeance has recoiled on myself. Since that day
I have separated myself from life and its ties--My manhood must know no
domestic home--must be soothed by no affectionate wife--My age must
know no kindly hearth--My grave must be solitary, and no offspring must
outlive me, to bear the ancient name of Bois-Guilbert. At the feet of
my Superior I have laid down the right of self-action--the privilege
of independence. The Templar, a serf in all but the name, can possess
neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, and breathes, but at the will
and pleasure of another.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said Rebecca, â€œwhat advantages could compensate for such an
absolute sacrifice?â€

â€œThe power of vengeance, Rebecca,â€ replied the Templar, â€œand the
prospects of ambition.â€

â€œAn evil recompense,â€ said Rebecca, â€œfor the surrender of the rights
which are dearest to humanity.â€

â€œSay not so, maiden,â€ answered the Templar; â€œrevenge is a feast for the
gods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves,
it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession
of mere mortals.--And ambition? it is a temptation which could disturb
even the bliss of heaven itself.â€--He paused a moment, and then added,
â€œRebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have a proud and
a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!--Nay, start not,â€ he added, â€œit must
be with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou must consent to
share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from the throne
of a monarch!--Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you refuse.--The
Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his power of free
agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty body, before
which thrones already tremble,--even as the single drop of rain which
mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that resistless ocean,
which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas. Such a swelling flood
is that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I am no mean member, but
already one of the Chief Commanders, and may well aspire one day to hold
the batoon of Grand Master. The poor soldiers of the Temple will not
alone place their foot upon the necks of kings--a hemp-sandallâ€™d monk
can do that. Our mailed step shall ascend their throne--our gauntlet
shall wrench the sceptre from their gripe. Not the reign of your
vainly-expected Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my
ambition may aim at. I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and
I have found such in thee.â€

â€œSayest thou this to one of my people?â€ answered Rebecca. â€œBethink
thee--â€

â€œAnswer me not,â€ said the Templar, â€œby urging the difference of our
creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in
derision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our
founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying
martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the swords of
savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert, valuable
only in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted bolder and
wider views, and found out a better indemnification for our sacrifices.
Our immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our high military
fame, which brings within our circle the flower of chivalry from every
Christian clime--these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders
little dreamed, and which are equally concealed from such weak spirits
as embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and whose superstition
makes them our passive tools. But I will not further withdraw the veil
of our mysteries. That bugle-sound announces something which may require
my presence. Think on what I have said.--Farewell!--I do not say forgive
me the violence I have threatened, for it was necessary to the display
of thy character. Gold can be only known by the application of the
touchstone. I will soon return, and hold further conference with thee.â€

He re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving
Rebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which
she had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold
bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. When she
entered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to
the God of Jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to
implore its continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided
into her petition--it was that of the wounded Christian, whom fate had
placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart
indeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity in prayer,
she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate
hers could have no alliance--a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But
the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices
of her sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.




CHAPTER XXV

  A damnâ€™d cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life!
  --She Stoops to Conquer

When the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy
already there. â€œYour love-suit,â€ said De Bracy, â€œhath, I suppose, been
disturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come
later and more reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has
proved more agreeable than mine.â€

â€œHas your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?â€
 said the Templar.

â€œBy the bones of Thomas a Becket,â€ answered De Bracy, â€œthe Lady Rowena
must have heard that I cannot endure the sight of womenâ€™s tears.â€

â€œAway!â€ said the Templar; â€œthou a leader of a Free Company, and regard
a womanâ€™s tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the
flame blaze the brighter.â€

â€œGramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,â€ replied De Bracy; â€œbut
this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was
such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of
St Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us. [30] A water-fiend hath possessed
the fair Saxon.â€

â€œA legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,â€ replied the
Templar; â€œfor, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself, could
have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.--But where is
Front-de-Boeuf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously.â€

â€œHe is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,â€ replied De Bracy, coolly;
â€œprobably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle.
Thou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his
treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Boeuf is like to offer,
will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and
trumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals call him.â€

They were soon after joined by Front-de-Boeuf, who had been disturbed in
his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted,
and had only tarried to give some necessary directions.

â€œLet us see the cause of this cursed clamour,â€ said
Front-de-Boeuf--â€œhere is a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in
Saxon.â€

He looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some
hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper,
and then handed it to De Bracy.

â€œIt may be magic spells for aught I know,â€ said De Bracy, who possessed
his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of
the period. â€œOur chaplain attempted to teach me to write,â€ he said, â€œbut
all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and so the
old shaveling gave up the task.â€

â€œGive it me,â€ said the Templar. â€œWe have that of the priestly character,
that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.â€

â€œLet us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then,â€ said De Bracy;
â€œwhat says the scroll?â€

â€œIt is a formal letter of defiance,â€ answered the Templar; â€œbut, by
our Lady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most
extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a
baronial castle.â€

â€œJest!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œI would gladly know who dares jest with me
in such a matter!--Read it, Sir Brian.â€

The Templar accordingly read it as follows:--â€œI, Wamba, the son of
Witless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood,
called the Saxon,--And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd---â€

â€œThou art mad,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, interrupting the reader.

â€œBy St Luke, it is so set down,â€ answered the Templar. Then resuming his
task, he went on,--â€œI, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, swineherd unto the
said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who
make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight,
called for the present â€˜Le Noir Faineantâ€™, and the stout yeoman, Robert
Locksley, called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front de-Boeuf, and
your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have,
without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized
upon the person of our lord and master the said Cedric; also upon
the person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the Lady Rowena of
Hargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man,
Athelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon the persons of certain freeborn
men, their â€˜cnichtsâ€™; also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen; also
upon a certain Jew, named Isaac of York, together with his daughter, a
Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which noble persons, with their
â€˜cnichtsâ€™ and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess
beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travelling as liege
subjects upon the kingâ€™s highway; therefore we require and demand
that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of Rotherwood, Rowena of
Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, with their servants,
â€˜cnichtsâ€™, and followers, also the horses and mules, Jew and Jewess
aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining, be,
within an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us, or to those
whom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and
unharmed in body and goods. Failing of which, we do pronounce to you,
that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies
against ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our utmost to
your annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may God have you in his
keeping.--Signed by us upon the eve of St Witholdâ€™s day, under the great
trysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a
holy man, Clerk to God, our Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of
Copmanhurst.â€

At the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a
rude sketch of a cockâ€™s head and comb, with a legend expressing this
hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this
respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the
son of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,
â€œLe Noir Faineantâ€. And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough
drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.

The knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then
gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to
know what it could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence by
an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with
more moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-Boeuf, on the contrary, seemed
impatient of their ill-timed jocularity.

â€œI give you plain warning,â€ he said, â€œfair sirs, that you had better
consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way
to such misplaced merriment.â€

â€œFront-de-Boeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow,â€
 said De Bracy to the Templar; â€œhe is cowed at the very idea of a cartel,
though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.â€

â€œBy St Michael,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf, â€œI would thou couldst stand
the whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These fellows dared
not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been
supported by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in this
forest to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow, who
was taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which
gored him to death in five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot at me
as there were launched against yonder target at Ashby.--Here, fellow,â€
 he added, to one of his attendants, â€œhast thou sent out to see by what
force this precious challenge is to be supported?â€

â€œThere are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,â€ answered a
squire who was in attendance.

â€œHere is a proper matter!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthis comes of lending
you the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly,
but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!â€

â€œOf hornets?â€ said De Bracy; â€œof stingless drones rather; a band of lazy
knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than labour
for their maintenance.â€

â€œStingless!â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf; â€œfork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard
in length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are
sting enough.â€

â€œFor shame, Sir Knight!â€ said the Templar. â€œLet us summon our people,
and sally forth upon them. One knight--ay, one man-at-arms, were enough
for twenty such peasants.â€

â€œEnough, and too much,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI should only be ashamed to
couch lance against them.â€

â€œTrue,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf; â€œwere they black Turks or Moors, Sir
Templar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy; but
these are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save
what we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little
in the glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men
enough to defend the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all
your band, De Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful
that were engaged in this mad business.â€

â€œThou dost not fear,â€ said the Templar, â€œthat they can assemble in force
sufficient to attempt the castle?â€

â€œNot so, Sir Brian,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf. â€œThese outlaws have indeed
a daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced
leaders, my castle may defy them.â€

â€œSend to thy neighbours,â€ said the Templar, â€œlet them assemble their
people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester
and a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-Boeuf!â€

â€œYou jest, Sir Knight,â€ answered the baron; â€œbut to whom should I
send?--Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, and so
are my other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal
enterprise.â€

â€œThen send to York, and recall our people,â€ said De Bracy. â€œIf they
abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free Companions,
I will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in
green-wood.â€

â€œAnd who shall bear such a message?â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œthey will
beset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.--I have it,â€ he
added, after pausing for a moment--â€œSir Templar, thou canst write
as well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my
chaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas
carousals--â€

â€œSo please ye,â€ said the squire, who was still in attendance, â€œI think
old Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor.
He was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her,
which man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.â€

â€œGo, search them out, Engelred,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œand then, Sir
Templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.â€

â€œI would rather do it at the swordâ€™s point than at that of the pen,â€
 said Bois-Guilbert; â€œbut be it as you will.â€

He sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an epistle
of the following tenor:--â€œSir Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, with his noble
and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands
of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself the
Black Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought
to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no
right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. Touching
the prisoners we have made, we do in Christian charity require you to
send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them
with God; since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning
before noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements,
shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred
themselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require you to send
a priest to reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall render them
the last earthly service.â€

This letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to
the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had
brought.

The yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established
under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the
castle. Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and
Locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to
their summons. Around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a
bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed
the ordinary nature of their occupation. More than two hundred had
already assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they
obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather
in the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other
respects the same.

Besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting
of the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as
many bondsmen and servants from Cedricâ€™s extensive estate, had already
arrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were
armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes
converts to military purposes. Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the
like, were their chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy
of conquerors, were jealous of permitting to the vanquished Saxons the
possession or the use of swords and spears. These circumstances rendered
the assistance of the Saxons far from being so formidable to the
besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior numbers,
and the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise well have
made them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of
the Templar was now delivered.

Reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its
contents.

â€œBy the crook of St Dunstan,â€ said that worthy ecclesiastic, â€œwhich hath
brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of eâ€™er another
saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this jargon,
which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess.â€

He then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed
it to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to
Locksley.

â€œIf the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I
might know something of the matter,â€ said the brave yeoman; â€œbut as the
matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag thatâ€™s at
twelve miles distance.â€

â€œI must be clerk, then,â€ said the Black Knight; and taking the letter
from Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the
meaning in Saxon to his confederates.

â€œExecute the noble Cedric!â€ exclaimed Wamba; â€œby the rood, thou must be
mistaken, Sir Knight.â€

â€œNot I, my worthy friend,â€ replied the knight, â€œI have explained the
words as they are here set down.â€

â€œThen, by St Thomas of Canterbury,â€ replied Gurth, â€œwe will have the
castle, should we tear it down with our hands!â€

â€œWe have nothing else to tear it with,â€ replied Wamba; â€œbut mine are
scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.â€

â€œâ€˜Tis but a contrivance to gain time,â€ said Locksley; â€œthey dare not do
a deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty.â€

â€œI would,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œthere were some one among us who
could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands
with the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent,
this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure
us the information we desire.â€

â€œA plague on thee, and thy advice!â€ said the pious hermit; â€œI tell thee,
Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friarâ€™s frock, my priesthood,
my sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and when in my
green jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one Christian.â€

â€œI fear,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œI fear greatly, there is no one here
that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character
of father confessor?â€

All looked on each other, and were silent.

â€œI see,â€ said Wamba, after a short pause, â€œthat the fool must be still
the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from.
You must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet before
I wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came
upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with the
assistance of the good hermitâ€™s frock, together with the priesthood,
sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, I shall
be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our
worthy master Cedric, and his companions in adversity.â€

â€œHath he sense enough, thinkst thou?â€ said the Black Knight, addressing
Gurth.

â€œI know not,â€ said Gurth; â€œbut if he hath not, it will be the first time
he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.â€

â€œOn with the frock, then, good fellow,â€ quoth the Knight, â€œand let thy
master send us an account of their situation within the castle. Their
numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a
sudden and bold attack. Time wears--away with thee.â€

â€œAnd, in the meantime,â€ said Locksley, â€œwe will beset the place so
closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So
that, my good friend,â€ he continued, addressing Wamba, â€œthou mayst
assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the
persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their
own.â€

â€œPax vobiscum,â€ said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious
disguise.

And so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,
and departed to execute his mission.




CHAPTER XXVI

     The hottest horse will oft be cool,
     The dullest will show fire;
     The friar will often play the fool,
     The fool will play the friar.
     --Old Song

When the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having
his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of
the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and
errand.

â€œPax vobiscum,â€ answered the Jester, â€œI am a poor brother of the Order
of St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy
prisoners now secured within this castle.â€

â€œThou art a bold friar,â€ said the warder, â€œto come hither, where, saving
our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these
twenty years.â€

â€œYet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,â€ answered
the pretended friar; â€œtrust me it will find good acceptance with him,
and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.â€

â€œGramercy,â€ said the warder; â€œbut if I come to shame for leaving my
post upon thine errand, I will try whether a friarâ€™s grey gown be proof
against a grey-goose shaft.â€

With this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the
castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the
gate and demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received
his masterâ€™s commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having
previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed,
without further scruple, the commands which he had received. The
harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this
dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found
himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as
Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, and he brought out his â€œpax vobiscumâ€, to which
he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with
more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. But
Front-de-Boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his
presence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him
any cause of suspicion.

â€œWho and whence art thou, priest?â€ said he.

â€œâ€˜Pax vobiscumâ€™,â€ reiterated the Jester, â€œI am a poor servant of St
Francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among
thieves, (as Scripture hath it,) â€˜quidam viator incidit in latronesâ€™,
which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly
office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.â€

â€œAy, right,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf; â€œand canst thou tell me, holy
father, the number of those banditti?â€

â€œGallant sir,â€ answered the Jester, â€œâ€˜nomen illis legioâ€™, their name is
legion.â€

â€œTell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak
and cord will ill protect thee.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said the supposed friar, â€œâ€˜cor meum eructavitâ€™, that is to
say, I was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be--what of
yeomen--what of commons, at least five hundred men.â€

â€œWhat!â€ said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, â€œmuster
the wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood.â€
 Then taking Front-de-Boeuf aside â€œKnowest thou the priest?â€

â€œHe is a stranger from a distant convent,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œI know
him not.â€

â€œThen trust him not with thy purpose in words,â€ answered the Templar.
â€œLet him carry a written order to De Bracyâ€™s company of Free Companions,
to repair instantly to their masterâ€™s aid. In the meantime, and that the
shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of
preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.â€

â€œIt shall be so,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf. And he forthwith appointed a
domestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane
were confined.

The impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his
confinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the
attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach
of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes
addressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of
the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the
liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting
himself about the duration of his captivity, which he concluded, would,
like all earthly evils, find an end in Heavenâ€™s good time.

â€œâ€˜Pax vobiscumâ€™,â€ said the Jester, entering the apartment; â€œthe blessing
of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saints whatsoever, be
upon ye and about ye.â€

â€œEnter freely,â€ answered Cedric to the supposed friar; â€œwith what intent
art thou come hither?â€

â€œTo bid you prepare yourselves for death,â€ answered the Jester.

â€œIt is impossible!â€ replied Cedric, starting. â€œFearless and wicked as
they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!â€

â€œAlas!â€ said the Jester, â€œto restrain them by their sense of humanity,
is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.
Bethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant Athelstane,
what crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye
be called to answer at a higher tribunal.â€

â€œHearest thou this, Athelstane?â€ said Cedric; â€œwe must rouse up our
hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men,
than live like slaves.â€

â€œI am ready,â€ answered Athelstane, â€œto stand the worst of their malice,
and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did to my
dinner.â€

â€œLet us then unto our holy gear, father,â€ said Cedric.

â€œWait yet a moment, good uncle,â€ said the Jester, in his natural tone;
â€œbetter look long before you leap in the dark.â€

â€œBy my faith,â€ said Cedric, â€œI should know that voice!â€

â€œIt is that of your trusty slave and jester,â€ answered Wamba, throwing
back his cowl. â€œHad you taken a foolâ€™s advice formerly, you would not
have been here at all. Take a foolâ€™s advice now, and you will not be
here long.â€

â€œHow meanâ€™st thou, knave?â€ answered the Saxon.

â€œEven thus,â€ replied Wamba; â€œtake thou this frock and cord, which are
all the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving
me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.â€

â€œLeave thee in my stead!â€ said Cedric, astonished at the proposal; â€œwhy,
they would hang thee, my poor knave.â€

â€œEâ€™en let them do as they are permitted,â€ said Wamba; â€œI trust--no
disparagement to your birth--that the son of Witless may hang in a chain
with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.â€

â€œWell, Wamba,â€ answered Cedric, â€œfor one thing will I grant thy request.
And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with Lord
Athelstane instead of me.â€

â€œNo, by St Dunstan,â€ answered Wamba; â€œthere were little reason in that.
Good right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to save
the son of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the
benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.â€

â€œVillain,â€ said Cedric, â€œthe fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of
England!â€

â€œThey might be whomsoever they pleased,â€ replied Wamba; â€œbut my neck
stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake.
Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me
to leave this dungeon as free as I entered.â€

â€œLet the old tree wither,â€ continued Cedric, â€œso the stately hope of the
forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it is
the duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will abide
together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and
safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.â€

â€œNot so, father Cedric,â€ said Athelstane, grasping his hand,--for, when
roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his
high race--â€œNot so,â€ he continued; â€œI would rather remain in this hall
a week without food save the prisonerâ€™s stinted loaf, or drink save
the prisonerâ€™s measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape
which the slaveâ€™s untaught kindness has purveyed for his master.â€

â€œYou are called wise men, sirs,â€ said the Jester, â€œand I a crazed fool;
but, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide this
controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any
farther. I am like John-a-Duckâ€™s mare, that will let no man mount
her but John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not
consent--basta--I can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be
chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. Iâ€™ll hang
for no man but my own born master.â€

â€œGo, then, noble Cedric,â€ said Athelstane, â€œneglect not this
opportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our
rescue--your remaining here would ruin us all.â€

â€œAnd is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?â€ said Cedric,
looking to the Jester.

â€œProspect, indeed!â€ echoed Wamba; â€œlet me tell you, when you fill my
cloak, you are wrapped in a generalâ€™s cassock. Five hundred men are
there without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My
foolâ€™s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see
what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I
fear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so
farewell, master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let
my cockscomb hang in the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung away
my life for my master, like a faithful---fool.â€

The last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest
and earnest. The tears stood in Cedricâ€™s eyes.

â€œThy memory shall be preserved,â€ he said, â€œwhile fidelity and affection
have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of
saving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba, thou
shouldst not overbear me in this matter.â€

The exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck
Cedric.

â€œI know no language,â€ he said, â€œbut my own, and a few words of their
mincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend brother?â€

â€œThe spell lies in two words,â€ replied Wamba--â€œâ€˜Pax vobiscumâ€™ will
answer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, â€˜Pax
vobiscumâ€™ carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a
broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a
deep grave tone,--â€˜Pax vobiscum!â€™--it is irresistible--Watch and ward,
knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all.
I think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to
be doubted they may, I will try its weight upon the finisher of the
sentence.â€

â€œIf such prove the case,â€ said the master, â€œmy religious orders are soon
taken--â€˜Pax vobiscumâ€™. I trust I shall remember the pass-word.--Noble
Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make
amends for a weaker head--I will save you, or return and die with you.
The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats
in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave
who risked himself for his master, if Cedricâ€™s peril can prevent
it.--Farewell.â€

â€œFarewell, noble Cedric,â€ said Athelstane; â€œremember it is the true part
of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.â€

â€œFarewell, uncle,â€ added Wamba; â€œand remember â€˜Pax vobiscumâ€™.â€

Thus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not
long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his Jester
had recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky passage, by
which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was
interrupted by a female form.

â€œâ€˜Pax vobiscum!â€™â€ said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to
hurry past, when a soft voice replied, â€œâ€˜Et vobis--quaso, domine
reverendissime, pro misericordia vestraâ€™.â€

â€œI am somewhat deaf,â€ replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same
time muttered to himself, â€œA curse on the fool and his â€˜Pax vobiscum!â€™ I
have lost my javelin at the first cast.â€

It was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf
of his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew full
well.

â€œI pray you of dear love, reverend father,â€ she replied in his own
language, â€œthat you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a
wounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and
us as thy holy office teaches--Never shall good deed so highly advantage
thy convent.â€

â€œDaughter,â€ answered Cedric, much embarrassed, â€œmy time in this castle
will not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office--I must
presently forth--there is life and death upon my speed.â€

â€œYet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,â€
 replied the suppliant, â€œnot to leave the oppressed and endangered
without counsel or succour.â€

â€œMay the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls of
Odin and of Thor!â€ answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably
have proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual
character, when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of
Urfried, the old crone of the turret.

â€œHow, minion,â€ said she to the female speaker, â€œis this the manner
in which you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy
prison-cell yonder?--Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious
language to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?â€

â€œA Jewess!â€ said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get
clear of their interruption,--â€œLet me pass, woman! stop me not at your
peril. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution.â€

â€œCome this way, father,â€ said the old hag, â€œthou art a stranger in this
castle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for I would
speak with thee.--And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the sick
manâ€™s chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if you
again quit it without my permission!â€

Rebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to
suffer her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services
where she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of
the wounded Ivanhoe. With an understanding awake to their dangerous
situation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which
occurred, Rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of
religion, who, she learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this
godless castle. She watched the return of the supposed ecclesiastic,
with the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour of
the prisoners; with what imperfect success the reader has been just
acquainted.




CHAPTER XXVII

     Fond wretch! and what canst thou relate,
     But deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?
     Thy deeds are proved--thou knowâ€™st thy fate;
     But come, thy tale--begin--begin.
     * * * * *
     But I have griefs of other kind,
     Troubles and sorrows more severe;
     Give me to ease my tortured mind,
     Lend to my woes a patient ear;
     And let me, if I may not find
     A friend to help--find one to hear.
     --Crabbeâ€™s Hall of Justice

When Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the
apartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the
unwilling Cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully
secured. Then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons,
she placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather asserting a
fact than asking a question, â€œThou art Saxon, father--Deny it not,â€ she
continued, observing that Cedric hastened not to reply; â€œthe sounds of
my native language are sweet to mine ears, though seldom heard save from
the tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom the proud
Normans impose the meanest drudgery of this dwelling. Thou art a
Saxon, father--a Saxon, and, save as thou art a servant of God, a
freeman.--Thine accents are sweet in mine ear.â€

â€œDo not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?â€ replied Cedric; â€œit
were, methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed children
of the soil.â€

â€œThey come not--or if they come, they better love to revel at the boards
of their conquerors,â€ answered Urfried, â€œthan to hear the groans of
their countrymen--so, at least, report speaks of them--of myself I can
say little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to no priest save
the debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of
Front-de-Boeuf, and he has been long gone to render an account of his
stewardship.--But thou art a Saxon--a Saxon priest, and I have one
question to ask of thee.â€

â€œI am a Saxon,â€ answered Cedric, â€œbut unworthy, surely, of the name of
priest. Let me begone on my way--I swear I will return, or send one of
our fathers more worthy to hear your confession.â€

â€œStay yet a while,â€ said Urfried; â€œthe accents of the voice which thou
hearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and I would
not descend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me
strength to tell the horrors of my tale.â€ She poured out a cup, and
drank it with a frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining the
last drop in the goblet. â€œIt stupifies,â€ she said, looking upwards as
she finished her drought, â€œbut it cannot cheer--Partake it, father, if
you would hear my tale without sinking down upon the pavement.â€ Cedric
would have avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality, but the
sign which she made to him expressed impatience and despair. He complied
with her request, and answered her challenge in a large wine-cup; she
then proceeded with her story, as if appeased by his complaisance.

â€œI was not born,â€ she said, â€œfather, the wretch that thou now seest me.
I was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and was beloved. I am now a
slave, miserable and degraded--the sport of my mastersâ€™ passions while
I had yet beauty--the object of their contempt, scorn, and hatred,
since it has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should hate
mankind, and, above all, the race that has wrought this change in me?
Can the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself
in impotent curses, forget she was once the daughter of the noble Thane
of Torquilstone, before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?â€

â€œThou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!â€ said Cedric, receding as he
spoke; â€œthou--thou--the daughter of that noble Saxon, my fatherâ€™s friend
and companion in arms!â€

â€œThy fatherâ€™s friend!â€ echoed Urfried; â€œthen Cedric called the Saxon
stands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood had but one son,
whose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric of
Rotherwood, why this religious dress?--hast thou too despaired of saving
thy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of the
convent?â€

â€œIt matters not who I am,â€ said Cedric; â€œproceed, unhappy woman, with
thy tale of horror and guilt!--Guilt there must be--there is guilt even
in thy living to tell it.â€

â€œThere is--there is,â€ answered the wretched woman, â€œdeep, black, damning
guilt,--guilt, that lies like a load at my breast--guilt, that all the
penitential fires of hereafter cannot cleanse.--Yes, in these halls,
stained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my brethren--in
these very halls, to have lived the paramour of their murderer, the
slave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to render every
breath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.â€

â€œWretched woman!â€ exclaimed Cedric. â€œAnd while the friends of thy
father--while each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his
soul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the
murdered Ulrica--while all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast
lived to merit our hate and execration--lived to unite thyself with the
vile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearest--who shed the blood
of infancy, rather than a male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger
should survive--with him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the
hands of lawless love!â€

â€œIn lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!â€ answered the
hag; â€œlove will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than
those unhallowed vaults.--No, with that at least I cannot reproach
myself--hatred to Front-de-Boeuf and his race governed my soul most
deeply, even in the hour of his guilty endearments.â€

â€œYou hated him, and yet you lived,â€ replied Cedric; â€œwretch! was there
no poniard--no knife--no bodkin!--Well was it for thee, since thou didst
prize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman castle are like
those of the grave. For had I but dreamed of the daughter of Torquil
living in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of a
true Saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour!â€

â€œWouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of Torquil?â€
 said Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of Urfried;
â€œthou art then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even within these
accursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself in
inscrutable mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been sounded--and
I, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there yet
breathed an avenger of our unhappy nation.--I also have had my hours of
vengeance--I have fomented the quarrels of our foes, and heated drunken
revelry into murderous broil--I have seen their blood flow--I have heard
their dying groans!--Look on me, Cedric--are there not still left on
this foul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?â€

â€œAsk me not of them, Ulrica,â€ replied Cedric, in a tone of grief mixed
with abhorrence; â€œthese traces form such a resemblance as arises from
the graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ answered Ulrica; â€œyet wore these fiendish features the mask
of a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder
Front-de-Boeuf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide
what followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what
it would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering fire of
discord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son--long had I
nursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred--it blazed forth in an hour of
drunken wassail, and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of
his own son--such are the secrets these vaults conceal!--Rend asunder,
ye accursed arches,â€ she added, looking up towards the roof, â€œand bury
in your fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!â€

â€œAnd thou, creature of guilt and misery,â€ said Cedric, â€œwhat became thy
lot on the death of thy ravisher?â€

â€œGuess it, but ask it not.--Here--here I dwelt, till age, premature age,
has stamped its ghastly features on my countenance--scorned and insulted
where I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which had
once such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented
menial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag--condemned
to hear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which I once
partook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.â€

â€œUlrica,â€ said Cedric, â€œwith a heart which still, I fear, regrets the
lost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst
acquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who
wears this robe? Consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted
Edward himself do for thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal
Confessor was endowed by heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the
body, but only God himself can cure the leprosy of the soul.â€

â€œYet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,â€ she exclaimed, â€œbut
tell me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new and awful
feelings that burst on my solitude--Why do deeds, long since done, rise
before me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate is prepared beyond
the grave for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such
unspeakable wretchedness? Better had I turn to Woden, Hertha, and
Zernebock--to Mista, and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized
ancestors, than endure the dreadful anticipations which have of late
haunted my waking and my sleeping hours!â€

â€œI am no priest,â€ said Cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable
picture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; â€œI am no priest, though I
wear a priestâ€™s garment.â€

â€œPriest or layman,â€ answered Ulrica, â€œthou art the first I have seen for
twenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; and dost thou bid
me despair?â€

â€œI bid thee repent,â€ said Cedric. â€œSeek to prayer and penance, and
mayest thou find acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longer abide with
thee.â€

â€œStay yet a moment!â€ said Ulrica; â€œleave me not now, son of my fatherâ€™s
friend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me
to avenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn--Thinkest thou, if
Front-de-Boeuf found Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such a disguise,
that thy life would be a long one?--Already his eye has been upon thee
like a falcon on his prey.â€

â€œAnd be it so,â€ said Cedric; â€œand let him tear me with beak and talons,
ere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. I will die
a Saxon--true in word, open in deed--I bid thee avaunt!--touch me not,
stay me not!--The sight of Front-de-Boeuf himself is less odious to me
than thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; â€œgo thy way, and
forget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before thee
is the daughter of thy fatherâ€™s friend.--Go thy way--if I am separated
from mankind by my sufferings--separated from those whose aid I might
most justly expect--not less will I be separated from them in my
revenge!--No man shall aid me, but the ears of all men shall tingle to
hear of the deed which I shall dare to do!--Farewell!--thy scorn has
burst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kind--a thought
that my woes might claim the compassion of my people.â€

â€œUlrica,â€ said Cedric, softened by this appeal, â€œhast thou borne up and
endured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt thou
now yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when
repentance were thy fitter occupation?â€

â€œCedric,â€ answered Ulrica, â€œthou little knowest the human heart. To act
as I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires the maddening
love of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud
consciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart to
bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long passed
away--Age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge itself
dies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its vipers,
mixed with vain regrets for the past, and despair for the future!--Then,
when all other strong impulses have ceased, we become like the fiends
in hell, who may feel remorse, but never repentance.--But thy words have
awakened a new soul within me--Well hast thou said, all is possible for
those who dare to die!--Thou hast shown me the means of revenge, and be
assured I will embrace them. It has hitherto shared this wasted bosom
with other and with rival passions--henceforward it shall possess me
wholly, and thou thyself shalt say, that, whatever was the life of
Ulrica, her death well became the daughter of the noble Torquil. There
is a force without beleaguering this accursed castle--hasten to lead
them to the attack, and when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the
turret on the eastern angle of the donjon, press the Normans hard--they
will then have enough to do within, and you may win the wall in spite
both of bow and mangonel.--Begone, I pray thee--follow thine own fate,
and leave me to mine.â€

Cedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus
darkly announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-Boeuf was heard,
exclaiming, â€œWhere tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell
of Compostella, I will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to hatch
treason among my domestics!â€

â€œWhat a true prophet,â€ said Ulrica, â€œis an evil conscience! But heed him
not--out and to thy people--Cry your Saxon onslaught, and let them sing
their war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a burden to
it.â€

As she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald
Front-de-Boeuf entered the apartment. Cedric, with some difficulty,
compelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned
his courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.

â€œThy penitents, father, have made a long shrift--it is the better for
them, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou prepared them
for death?â€

â€œI found them,â€ said Cedric, in such French as he could command,
â€œexpecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they
had fallen.â€

â€œHow now, Sir Friar,â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthy speech, methinks,
smacks of a Saxon tongue?â€

â€œI was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,â€ answered Cedric.

â€œAy?â€ said the Baron; â€œit had been better for thee to have been a
Norman, and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice of
messengers. That St Witholdâ€™s of Burton is an owletâ€™s nest worth the
harrying. The day will soon come that the frock shall protect the Saxon
as little as the mail-coat.â€

â€œGodâ€™s will be done,â€ said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with passion,
which Front-de-Boeuf imputed to fear.

â€œI see,â€ said he, â€œthou dreamest already that our men-at-arms are in
thy refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holy office,
and, come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy cell as a
snail within his shell of proof.â€

â€œSpeak your commands,â€ said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.

â€œFollow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the
postern.â€

And as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-Boeuf
thus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.

â€œThou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to
environ this castle of Torquilstone--Tell them whatever thou hast a mind
of the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them
before it for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thou this scroll--But
soft--canst read, Sir Priest?â€

â€œNot a jot I,â€ answered Cedric, â€œsave on my breviary; and then I know
the characters, because I have the holy service by heart, praised be Our
Lady and St Withold!â€

â€œThe fitter messenger for my purpose.--Carry thou this scroll to the
castle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and is written by
the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to
York with all the speed man and horse can make. Meanwhile, tell him
to doubt nothing, he shall find us whole and sound behind our
battlement--Shame on it, that we should be compelled to hide thus by a
pack of runagates, who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons
and the tramp of our horses! I say to thee, priest, contrive some cast
of thine art to keep the knaves where they are, until our friends
bring up their lances. My vengeance is awake, and she is a falcon that
slumbers not till she has been gorged.â€

â€œBy my patron saint,â€ said Cedric, with deeper energy than became his
character, â€œand by every saint who has lived and died in England, your
commands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these
walls, if I have art and influence to detain them there.â€

â€œHa!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthou changest thy tone, Sir Priest, and
speakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the
Saxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?â€

Cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would
at this moment have been much the better of a hint from Wambaâ€™s more
fertile brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens
invention, and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men
in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.

â€œâ€˜Despardieuxâ€™,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthou hast spoken the very
truth--I forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as well as if
they had been born south of yonder salt channel. Was it not he of St
Ives whom they tied to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing a mass while
they were rifling his mails and his wallets?--No, by our Lady--that jest
was played by Gualtier of Middleton, one of our own companions-at-arms.
But they were Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of cup,
candlestick and chalice, were they not?â€

â€œThey were godless men,â€ answered Cedric.

â€œAy, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for
many a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils
and primes!--Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.â€

â€œI am indeed bound to vengeance,â€ murmured Cedric; â€œSaint Withold knows
my heart.â€

Front-de-Boeuf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where,
passing the moat on a single plank, they reached a small barbican,
or exterior defence, which communicated with the open field by a
well-fortified sallyport.

â€œBegone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return
hither when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon flesh cheap as ever was
hogâ€™s in the shambles of Sheffield. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be a
jolly confessor--come hither after the onslaught, and thou shalt have as
much Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.â€

â€œAssuredly we shall meet again,â€ answered Cedric.

â€œSomething in hand the whilst,â€ continued the Norman; and, as they
parted at the postern door, he thrust into Cedricâ€™s reluctant hand a
gold byzant, adding, â€œRemember, I will fly off both cowl and skin, if
thou failest in thy purpose.â€

â€œAnd full leave will I give thee to do both,â€ answered Cedric, leaving
the postern, and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step,
â€œif, when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine hand.â€--Turning
then back towards the castle, he threw the piece of gold towards the
donor, exclaiming at the same time, â€œFalse Norman, thy money perish with
thee!â€

Front-de-Boeuf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was
suspicious--â€œArchers,â€ he called to the warders on the outward
battlements, â€œsend me an arrow through yon monkâ€™s frock!--yet stay,â€ he
said, as his retainers were bending their bows, â€œit avails not--we must
thus far trust him since we have no better shift. I think he dares not
betray me--at the worst I can but treat with these Saxon dogs whom
I have safe in kennel.--Ho! Giles jailor, let them bring Cedric of
Rotherwood before me, and the other churl, his companion--him I mean of
Coningsburgh--Athelstane there, or what call they him? Their very names
are an encumbrance to a Norman knightâ€™s mouth, and have, as it were, a
flavour of bacon--Give me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John said,
that I may wash away the relish--place it in the armoury, and thither
lead the prisoners.â€

His commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment, hung
with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found
a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon captives
under the guard of four of his dependants. Front-de-Boeuf took a long
drought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;--for the manner in
which Wamba drew the cap over his face, the change of dress, the gloomy
and broken light, and the Baronâ€™s imperfect acquaintance with the
features of Cedric, (who avoided his Norman neighbours, and seldom
stirred beyond his own domains,) prevented him from discovering that the
most important of his captives had made his escape.

â€œGallants of England,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œhow relish ye your
entertainment at Torquilstone?--Are ye yet aware what your â€˜surquedyâ€™
and â€˜outrecuidanceâ€™ [31] merit, for scoffing at the entertainment of
a prince of the House of Anjou?--Have ye forgotten how ye requited the
unmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God and St Dennis, an ye pay
not the richer ransom, I will hang ye up by the feet from the iron bars
of these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have made skeletons
of you!--Speak out, ye Saxon dogs--what bid ye for your worthless
lives?--How say you, you of Rotherwood?â€

â€œNot a doit I,â€ answered poor Wamba--â€œand for hanging up by the feet,
my brain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since the biggin was bound
first round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore
it again.â€

â€œSaint Genevieve!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œwhat have we got here?â€

And with the back of his hand he struck Cedricâ€™s cap from the head of
the Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of
servitude, the silver collar round his neck.

â€œGiles--Clement--dogs and varlets!â€ exclaimed the furious Norman, â€œwhat
have you brought me here?â€

â€œI think I can tell you,â€ said De Bracy, who just entered the apartment.
â€œThis is Cedricâ€™s clown, who fought so manful a skirmish with Isaac of
York about a question of precedence.â€

â€œI shall settle it for them both,â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf; â€œthey
shall hang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar of
Coningsburgh will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least
they can surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarms that
are besetting the castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended
immunities, and live under us as serfs and vassals; too happy if, in
the new world that is about to begin, we leave them the breath of their
nostrils.--Go,â€ said he to two of his attendants, â€œfetch me the right
Cedric hither, and I pardon your error for once; the rather that you but
mistook a fool for a Saxon franklin.â€

â€œAy, but,â€ said Wamba, â€œyour chivalrous excellency will find there are
more fools than franklins among us.â€

â€œWhat means the knave?â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, looking towards his
followers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that
if this were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what
was become of him.

â€œSaints of Heaven!â€ exclaimed De Bracy, â€œhe must have escaped in the
monkâ€™s garments!â€

â€œFiends of hell!â€ echoed Front-de-Boeuf, â€œit was then the boar of
Rotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed with my own
hands!--And thou,â€ he said to Wamba, â€œwhose folly could overreach the
wisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyself--I will give thee holy
orders--I will shave thy crown for thee!--Here, let them tear the scalp
from his head, and then pitch him headlong from the battlements--Thy
trade is to jest, canst thou jest now?â€

â€œYou deal with me better than your word, noble knight,â€ whimpered forth
poor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even
by the immediate prospect of death; â€œif you give me the red cap you
propose, out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.â€

â€œThe poor wretch,â€ said De Bracy, â€œis resolved to die in his
vocation.--Front-de-Boeuf, you shall not slay him. Give him to me to
make sport for my Free Companions.--How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou
take heart of grace, and go to the wars with me?â€

â€œAy, with my masterâ€™s leave,â€ said Wamba; â€œfor, look you, I must
not slip collarâ€ (and he touched that which he wore) â€œwithout his
permission.â€

â€œOh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.â€ said De Bracy.

â€œAy, noble sir,â€ said Wamba, â€œand thence goes the proverb--

     â€˜Norman saw on English oak,
     On English neck a Norman yoke;
     Norman spoon in English dish,
     And England ruled as Normans wish;
     Blithe world to England never will be more,
     Till Englandâ€™s rid of all the four.â€™â€

â€œThou dost well, De Bracy,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œto stand there
listening to a foolâ€™s jargon, when destruction is gaping for us! Seest
thou not we are overreached, and that our proposed mode of communicating
with our friends without has been disconcerted by this same motley
gentleman thou art so fond to brother? What views have we to expect but
instant storm?â€

â€œTo the battlements then,â€ said De Bracy; â€œwhen didst thou ever see me
the graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templar yonder, and
let him fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his
Order--Make thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body--Let me do my
poor endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as
well attempt to scale the clouds, as the castle of Torquilstone; or, if
you will treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of
this worthy franklin, who seems in such deep contemplation of the
wine-flagon?--Here, Saxon,â€ he continued, addressing Athelstane, and
handing the cup to him, â€œrinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and
rouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty.â€

â€œWhat a man of mould may,â€ answered Athelstane, â€œproviding it be what a
man of manhood ought.--Dismiss me free, with my companions, and I will
pay a ransom of a thousand marks.â€

â€œAnd wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who
are swarming around the castle, contrary to Godâ€™s peace and the kingâ€™s?â€
 said Front-de-Boeuf.

â€œIn so far as I can,â€ answered Athelstane, â€œI will withdraw them; and I
fear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assist me.â€

â€œWe are agreed then,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf--â€œthou and they are to be set
at freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of a thousand
marks. It is a trifling ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to
the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. But
mark, this extends not to the Jew Isaac.â€

â€œNor to the Jew Isaacâ€™s daughter,â€ said the Templar, who had now joined
them.

â€œNeither,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œbelong to this Saxonâ€™s company.â€

â€œI were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,â€ replied
Athelstane: â€œdeal with the unbelievers as ye list.â€

â€œNeither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,â€ said De Bracy. â€œIt
shall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize without striking a
blow for it.â€

â€œNeither,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œdoes our treaty refer to this wretched
Jester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example to every knave who
turns jest into earnest.â€

â€œThe Lady Rowena,â€ answered Athelstane, with the most steady
countenance, â€œis my affianced bride. I will be drawn by wild horses
before I consent to part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved
the life of my father Cedric--I will lose mine ere a hair of his head be
injured.â€

â€œThy affianced bride?--The Lady Rowena the affianced bride of a vassal
like thee?â€ said De Bracy; â€œSaxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy
seven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the House
of Anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.â€

â€œMy lineage, proud Norman,â€ replied Athelstane, â€œis drawn from a source
more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly Frenchman, whose living
is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his
paltry standard. Kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in
council, who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou
canst number individual followers; whose names have been sung by
minstrels, and their laws recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were
interred amid the prayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have
been builded.â€

â€œThou hast it, De Bracy,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, well pleased with the
rebuff which his companion had received; â€œthe Saxon hath hit thee
fairly.â€

â€œAs fairly as a captive can strike,â€ said De Bracy, with apparent
carelessness; â€œfor he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at
freedom.--But thy glibness of reply, comrade,â€ rejoined he, speaking to
Athelstane, â€œwill not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.â€

To this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his
custom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. The
conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced
that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.

â€œIn the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,â€ said
Front-de-Boeuf, â€œhave we a real monk this time, or another impostor?
Search him, slaves--for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed
upon you, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coals put into the
sockets.â€

â€œLet me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,â€ said Giles, â€œif
this be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows him well, and
will vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the
Prior of Jorvaulx.â€

â€œAdmit him,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œmost likely he brings us news from
his jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests are
relieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the
country. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think on what thou hast
heard.â€

â€œI claim,â€ said Athelstane, â€œan honourable imprisonment, with due care
of my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one
who is in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself the
best of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on
my freedom. This defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer;
thou underliest it, and art bound to answer me--There lies my glove.â€

â€œI answer not the challenge of my prisoner,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf;
â€œnor shalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.--Giles,â€ he continued, â€œhang the
franklinâ€™s glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall
it remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume to demand it,
or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of Saint
Christopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe
on foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!â€

The Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced
the monk Ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.

â€œThis is the real â€˜Deus vobiscumâ€™,â€ said Wamba, as he passed the
reverend brother; â€œthe others were but counterfeits.â€

â€œHoly Mother,â€ said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, â€œI
am at last safe and in Christian keeping!â€

â€œSafe thou art,â€ replied De Bracy; â€œand for Christianity, here is the
stout Baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf, whose utter abomination is a Jew;
and the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to
slay Saracens--If these are not good marks of Christianity, I know no
other which they bear about them.â€

â€œYe are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior
of Jorvaulx,â€ said the monk, without noticing the tone of De Bracyâ€™s
reply; â€œye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what
saith the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise â€˜De Civitate Deiâ€™---â€

â€œWhat saith the devil!â€ interrupted Front-de-Boeuf; â€œor rather what dost
thou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts from the holy
fathers.â€

â€œâ€˜Sancta Maria!â€™â€ ejaculated Father Ambrose, â€œhow prompt to ire are
these unhallowed laymen!--But be it known to you, brave knights,
that certain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and
reverence of his church, and not regarding the bull of the holy see, â€˜Si
quis, suadende Diaboloâ€™---â€

â€œBrother priest,â€ said the Templar, â€œall this we know or guess at--tell
us plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and to whom?â€

â€œSurely,â€ said Ambrose, â€œhe is in the hands of the men of Belial,
infesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, â€˜Touch not
mine anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.â€™â€

â€œHere is a new argument for our swords, sirs,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf,
turning to his companions; â€œand so, instead of reaching us any
assistance, the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is
well helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!--But speak
out, priest, and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?â€

â€œSo please you,â€ said Ambrose, â€œviolent hands having been imposed on my
reverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance which I did already
quote, and the men of Belial having rifled his mails and budgets, and
stripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold, they do yet
demand of him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart
from their uncircumcised hands. Wherefore the reverend father in God
prays you, as his dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down
the ransom at which they hold him, or by force of arms, at your best
discretion.â€

â€œThe foul fiend quell the Prior!â€ said Front-de-Boeuf; â€œhis morningâ€™s
drought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of a Norman baron
unbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten times
as weighty as ours?--And how can we do aught by valour to free him, that
are cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every
moment?â€

â€œAnd that was what I was about to tell you,â€ said the monk, â€œhad your
hastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, and these foul
onslaughts distract an aged manâ€™s brain. Nevertheless, it is of verity
that they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this
castle.â€

â€œTo the battlements!â€ cried De Bracy, â€œand let us mark what these knaves
do without;â€ and so saying, he opened a latticed window which led to
a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called from
thence to those in the apartment--â€œSaint Dennis, but the old monk hath
brought true tidings!--They bring forward mantelets and pavisses, [32]
and the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud
before a hailstorm.â€

Reginald Front-de-Boeuf also looked out upon the field, and immediately
snatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded
his men to their posts on the walls.

â€œDe Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest--Noble
Bois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and defend,
look thou to the western side--I myself will take post at the barbican.
Yet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble friends!--we
must this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves, were it possible,
so as to carry by our presence succour and relief wherever the attack is
hottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and courage may supply that
defect, since we have only to do with rascal clowns.â€

â€œBut, noble knights,â€ exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle and
confusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, â€œwill none of
ye hear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of
Jorvaulx?--I beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!â€

â€œGo patter thy petitions to heaven,â€ said the fierce Norman, â€œfor we
on earth have no time to listen to them.--Ho! there, Anselm I see that
seething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these audacious
traitors--Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts. [33]--Fling abroad
my banner with the old bullâ€™s head--the knaves shall soon find with whom
they have to do this day!â€

â€œBut, noble sir,â€ continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours
to draw attention, â€œconsider my vow of obedience, and let me discharge
myself of my Superiorâ€™s errand.â€

â€œAway with this prating dotard,â€ said Front-de Boeuf, â€œlock him up in
the chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be a new
thing to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have
not been so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out of stone.â€

â€œBlaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,â€ said De Bracy, â€œwe shall
have need of their aid to-day before yon rascal rout disband.â€

â€œI expect little aid from their hand,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œunless we
were to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the villains.
There is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufficient to bear a
whole company to the earth.â€

The Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of
the besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutal Front-de-Boeuf
or his giddy companion.

â€œBy the faith of mine order,â€ he said, â€œthese men approach with more
touch of discipline than could have been judged, however they come by
it. See ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which
a tree or bush affords, and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our
cross-bows? I spy neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will
I gage my golden chain, that they are led on by some noble knight or
gentleman, skilful in the practice of wars.â€

â€œI espy him,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI see the waving of a knightâ€™s crest,
and the gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the black mail, who is
busied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomen--by Saint
Dennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called â€˜Le Noir Faineantâ€™, who
overthrew thee, Front-de-Boeuf, in the lists at Ashby.â€

â€œSo much the better,â€ said Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthat he comes here to give
me my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who dared not stay to
assert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I
should in vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their
foes, and right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain
yeomanry.â€

The demonstrations of the enemyâ€™s immediate approach cut off all farther
discourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at the head of the
few followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in numbers
inadequate to defend the whole extent of the walls, they awaited with
calm determination the threatened assault.




CHAPTER XXVIII

     This wandering race, severâ€™d from other men,
     Boast yet their intercourse with human arts;
     The seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt,
     Find them acquainted with their secret treasures:
     And unregarded herbs, and flowers, and blossoms,
     Display undreamt-of powers when gatherâ€™d by them.
     --The Jew

Our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to
inform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the
rest of this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have
easily anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by
all the world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on her
father to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to
the house which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of Ashby.

It would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step in
any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. But
he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted
people, and those were to be conquered.

â€œHoly Abraham!â€ he exclaimed, â€œhe is a good youth, and my heart bleeds
to see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his
corslet of goodly price--but to carry him to our house!--damsel, hast
thou well considered?--he is a Christian, and by our law we may not deal
with the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.â€

â€œSpeak not so, my dear father,â€ replied Rebecca; â€œwe may not indeed mix
with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the
Gentile becometh the Jewâ€™s brother.â€

â€œI would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,â€
 replied Isaac;--â€œnevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death.
Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.â€

â€œNay, let them place him in my litter,â€ said Rebecca; â€œI will mount one
of the palfreys.â€

â€œThat were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of
Edom,â€ whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of
knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her
charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until
Isaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried
voice--â€œBeard of Aaron!--what if the youth perish!--if he die in our
custody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces
by the multitude?â€

â€œHe will not die, my father,â€ said Rebecca, gently extricating herself
from the grasp of Isaac â€œhe will not die unless we abandon him; and if
so, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.â€

â€œNay,â€ said Isaac, releasing his hold, â€œit grieveth me as much to see
the drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from mine
own purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter of the
Rabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made thee
skilful in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of herbs,
and the force of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth thee--thou
art a good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of rejoicing unto
me and unto my house, and unto the people of my fathers.â€

The apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the
generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her
return to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The
Templar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold
and ardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the
consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident
threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.

Rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their
temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and
to bind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic
ballads, must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as
they are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how
frequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her
cure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.

But the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical
science in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of the
time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some experienced
sage among this despised people, when wounded or in sickness. The aid
of the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly sought after, though
a general belief prevailed among the Christians, that the Jewish Rabbins
were deeply acquainted with the occult sciences, and particularly with
the cabalistical art, which had its name and origin in the studies of
the sages of Israel. Neither did the Rabbins disown such acquaintance
with supernatural arts, which added nothing (for what could add aught?)
to the hatred with which their nation was regarded, while it diminished
the contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician
might be the subject of equal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer, but he
could not be equally despised. It is besides probable, considering the
wonderful cures they are said to have performed, that the Jews possessed
some secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with
the exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great
care to conceal from the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.

The beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge
proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained,
arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years,
her sex, and even the age in which she lived. Her knowledge of medicine
and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged Jewess, the
daughter of one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved Rebecca as
her own child, and was believed to have communicated to her secrets,
which had been left to herself by her sage father at the same time, and
under the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed been to fall
a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived
in her apt pupil.

Rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally
revered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of
those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself,
out of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself
with his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty
than was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her
people, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion,
even in preference to his own.

When Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state
of unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken
place during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound,
and having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed,
informed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great
bleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of
Miriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guestâ€™s
life, and that he might with safety travel to York with them on the
ensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His
charity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would
have left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he
was residing at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it
belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however,
Rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that
had peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no
account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another
physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be
discovered; the other, that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was
an intimate favourite of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and that, in case the
monarch should return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John with
treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small
need of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richardâ€™s favour.

â€œThou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,â€ said Isaac, giving way to these
weighty arguments--â€œit were an offending of Heaven to betray the secrets
of the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not rashly
to be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and
shekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise
physician--assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom
Providence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England
call the Lionâ€™s Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the
hands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got
assurance of my dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to
thy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our
house shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. And if
he of the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised abroad,
then shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of defence, when
the kingâ€™s displeasure shall burn high against thy father. And if he
doth not return, this Wilfred may natheless repay us our charges when he
shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear and of his sword, even
as he did yesterday and this day also. For the youth is a good youth,
and keepeth the day which he appointeth, and restoreth that which he
borroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even the child of my fatherâ€™s
house, when he is encompassed by strong thieves and sons of Belial.â€

It was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to
consciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under
the confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery
from a state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall
exactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the
lists, or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had
been engaged upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined
to great weakness and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection
of blows dealt and received, of steeds rushing upon each other,
overthrowing and overthrown--of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the
heady tumult of a confused fight. An effort to draw aside the curtain of
his couch was in some degree successful, although rendered difficult by
the pain of his wound.

To his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently
furnished, but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in
other respects partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to
doubt whether he had not, during his sleep, been transported back
again to the land of Palestine. The impression was increased, when,
the tapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in a rich habit,
which partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided
through the door which it concealed, and was followed by a swarthy
domestic.

As the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she
imposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while
the attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoeâ€™s side, and
the lovely Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its place,
and the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful and
dignified simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more civilized
days, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to
female delicacy. The idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in
attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different
sex, was melted away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing
her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death.
Rebeccaâ€™s few and brief directions were given in the Hebrew language
to the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her assistant in
similar cases, obeyed them without reply.

The accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded
when uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca,
the romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms
pronounced by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear,
but, from the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect, which
accompanied them, touching and affecting to the heart. Without making
an attempt at further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence to take
the measures they thought most proper for his recovery; and it was not
until those were completed, and this kind physician about to retire,
that his curiosity could no longer be suppressed.--â€œGentle maiden,â€ he
began in the Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels had rendered
him familiar, and which he thought most likely to be understood by the
turbanâ€™d and caftanâ€™d damsel who stood before him--â€œI pray you, gentle
maiden, of your courtesy---â€

But here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she
could scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general
expression was that of contemplative melancholy. â€œI am of England, Sir
Knight, and speak the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage
belong to another climate.â€

â€œNoble damsel,â€--again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca
hastened to interrupt him.

â€œBestow not on me, Sir Knight,â€ she said, â€œthe epithet of noble. It is
well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor Jewess, the
daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good and
kind lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to
you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.â€

I know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied
with the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto
gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of
the lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,
mellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a
minstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays
through a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to
retain the same class of feelings towards a Jewess. This Rebecca had
foreseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her
fatherâ€™s name and lineage; yet--for the fair and wise daughter of Isaac
was not without a touch of female weakness--she could not but sigh
internally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether
unmixed with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his
unknown benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed,
and collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which
expressed a grateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected
quarter, and from one of an inferior race. It was not that Ivanhoeâ€™s
former carriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which
youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that one word should
operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could not be supposed
altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a degraded class,
to whom it could not be honourably rendered.

But the gentleness and candour of Rebeccaâ€™s nature imputed no fault to
Ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion.
On the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient now
regarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was
disgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased
not to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and
convalescence. She informed him of the necessity they were under of
removing to York, and of her fatherâ€™s resolution to transport him
thither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be
restored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan, which he
grounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.

â€œWas there not,â€ he said, â€œin Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin,
or even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a wounded
countrymanâ€™s residence with him until he should be again able to bear
his armour?--Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could be
received?--Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he was
sure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Witholdâ€™s, to
whom he was related?â€

â€œAny, the worst of these harbourages,â€ said Rebecca, with a melancholy
smile, â€œwould unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the
abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss your
physician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well know,
can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own
family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since
the days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced the
advantages. No Nazarene--I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight--no
Christian leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to
bear your corslet within a month.â€

â€œAnd how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?â€ said Ivanhoe,
impatiently.

â€œWithin eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my
directions,â€ replied Rebecca.

â€œBy Our Blessed Lady,â€ said Wilfred, â€œif it be not a sin to name her
here, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if
thou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque full
of crowns, come by them as I may.â€

â€œI will accomplish my promise,â€ said Rebecca, â€œand thou shalt bear thine
armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one boon
in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.â€

â€œIf it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may yield
to one of thy people,â€ replied Ivanhoe, â€œI will grant thy boon blithely
and thankfully.â€

â€œNay,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œI will but pray of thee to believe
henceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without
desiring other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made
both Jew and Gentile.â€

â€œIt were sin to doubt it, maiden,â€ replied Ivanhoe; â€œand I repose myself
on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting you will
enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my kind leech,
let me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon Cedric and
his household?--what of the lovely Lady--â€ He stopt, as if unwilling
to speak Rowenaâ€™s name in the house of a Jew--â€œOf her, I mean, who was
named Queen of the tournament?â€

â€œAnd who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with
judgment which was admired as much as your valour,â€ replied Rebecca.

The blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing
his cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in
Rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.

â€œIt was less of her I would speak,â€ said he, â€œthan of Prince John; and I
would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends me
not?â€

â€œLet me use my authority as a leech,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œand enjoin you
to keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize you
of what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament,
and set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights, and
churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring,
by fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the
land. It is said he designs to assume his brotherâ€™s crown.â€

â€œNot without a blow struck in its defence,â€ said Ivanhoe, raising
himself upon the couch, â€œif there were but one true subject in England I
will fight for Richardâ€™s title with the best of them--ay, one or two, in
his just quarrel!â€

â€œBut that you may be able to do so,â€ said Rebecca touching his shoulder
with her hand, â€œyou must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.â€

â€œTrue, maiden,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œas quiet as these disquieted times will
permit--And of Cedric and his household?â€

â€œHis steward came but brief while since,â€ said the Jewess, â€œpanting with
haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth
of Cedricâ€™s flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and Athelstane
of Coningsburgh had left Prince Johnâ€™s lodging in high displeasure, and
were about to set forth on their return homeward.â€

â€œWent any lady with them to the banquet?â€ said Wilfred.

â€œThe Lady Rowena,â€ said Rebecca, answering the question with more
precision than it had been asked--â€œThe Lady Rowena went not to the
Princeâ€™s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
journey back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your
faithful squire Gurth---â€

â€œHa!â€ exclaimed the knight, â€œknowest thou his name?--But thou dost,â€ he
immediately added, â€œand well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,
as I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he
received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.â€

â€œSpeak not of that,â€ said Rebecca, blushing deeply; â€œI see how easy it
is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.â€

â€œBut this sum of gold,â€ said Ivanhoe, gravely, â€œmy honour is concerned
in repaying it to your father.â€

â€œLet it be as thou wilt,â€ said Rebecca, â€œwhen eight days have passed
away; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy
recovery.â€

â€œBe it so, kind maiden,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œI were most ungrateful to
dispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and I have
done with questioning thee.â€

â€œI grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,â€ answered the Jewess, â€œthat he is in
custody by the order of Cedric.â€--And then observing the distress which
her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, â€œBut the steward
Oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his masterâ€™s displeasure
against him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a faithful
serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed
this error out of the love which he bore to Cedricâ€™s son. And he said,
moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the Jester,
were resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in case
Cedricâ€™s ire against him could not be mitigated.â€

â€œWould to God they may keep their purpose!â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œbut it seems
as if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to
me. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest
that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his
crown;--my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of
her sex;--and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman
but for his love and loyal service to me!--Thou seest, maiden, what an
ill-fated wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere
the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve
thee also in their pursuit.â€

â€œNay,â€ said Rebecca, â€œthy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee
miscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy
country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true
heart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy
king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which
thou hast sustained, seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a helper
and a physician, even among the most despised of the land?--Therefore,
be of good courage, and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel
which thine arm shall work before this people. Adieu--and having taken
the medicine which I shall send thee by the hand of Reuben, compose
thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the
journey on the succeeding day.â€

Ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of
Rebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative
and narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed
slumbers. In the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from
feverish symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.

He was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the
lists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one
circumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure
sufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac,
like the enriched traveller of Juvenalâ€™s tenth satire, had ever the fear
of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike accounted
fair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon outlaw. He
therefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts, and shorter
repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had several
hours the start of him, but who had been delayed by their protracted
feasting at the convent of Saint Witholdâ€™s. Yet such was the virtue of
Miriamâ€™s balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoeâ€™s constitution, that
he did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his
kind physician had apprehended.

In another point of view, however, the Jewâ€™s haste proved somewhat more
than good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred
several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to attend
him as a guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means from
the national love of ease and good living which the Normans stigmatized
as laziness and gluttony. Reversing Shylockâ€™s position, they had
accepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy Jew, and
were very much displeased when they found themselves disappointed,
by the rapidity with which he insisted on their proceeding. They
remonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their horses by these
forced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and his satellites a
deadly feud, concerning the quantity of wine and ale to be allowed for
consumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that when the alarm of
danger approached, and that which Isaac feared was likely to come upon
him, he was deserted by the discontented mercenaries on whose protection
he had relied, without using the means necessary to secure their
attachment.

In this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded
patient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon
afterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates.
Little notice was at first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have
remained behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it
under the impression that it might contain the object of his enterprise,
for Rowena had not unveiled herself. But De Bracyâ€™s astonishment was
considerable, when he discovered that the litter contained a wounded
man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into the power of Saxon
outlaws, with whom his name might be a protection for himself and his
friends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

The ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity,
never utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight
any injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his
betraying him to Front-de-Boeuf, who would have had no scruples to put
to death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of
Ivanhoe. On the other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady
Rowena, as the events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfredâ€™s previous
banishment from his fatherâ€™s house, had made matter of notoriety, was
a pitch far above the flight of De Bracyâ€™s generosity. A middle
course betwixt good and evil was all which he found himself capable of
adopting, and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the
litter, and to suffer no one to approach it. If questioned, they were
directed by their master to say, that the empty litter of the Lady
Rowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been
wounded in the scuffle. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the Knight
Templar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own
schemes, the one on the Jewâ€™s treasure, and the other on his daughter,
De Bracyâ€™s squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded
comrade, to a distant apartment. This explanation was accordingly
returned by these men to Front-de-Boeuf, when he questioned them why
they did not make for the battlements upon the alarm.

â€œA wounded companion!â€ he replied in great wrath and astonishment. â€œNo
wonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay leaguer
before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances to nobles,
since men-at-arms have turned sick menâ€™s nurses, and Free Companions are
grown keepers of dying folkâ€™s curtains, when the castle is about to be
assailed.--To the battlements, ye loitering villains!â€ he exclaimed,
raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung again, â€œto the
battlements, or I will splinter your bones with this truncheon!â€

The men sulkily replied, â€œthat they desired nothing better than to go to
the battlements, providing Front-de-Boeuf would bear them out with their
master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.â€

â€œThe dying man, knaves!â€ rejoined the Baron; â€œI promise thee we shall
all be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I
will relieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.--Here,
Urfried--hag--fiend of a Saxon witch--hearest me not?--tend me this
bedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves
use their weapons.--Here be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and
quarrells [34]--to the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt
through a Saxon brain.â€

The men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise
and detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were
commanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to Urfried,
or Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries
and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon Rebecca
the care of her patient.




CHAPTER XXIX

     Ascend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,
     Look on the field, and say how goes the battle.
     --Schillerâ€™s Maid of Orleans

A moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and
affection. We are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our
feelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil
periods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether
suppress them. In finding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe,
Rebecca was astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she
experienced, even at a time when all around them both was danger, if not
despair. As she felt his pulse, and enquired after his health, there was
a softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest
than she would herself have been pleased to have voluntarily expressed.
Her voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was only the cold
question of Ivanhoe, â€œIs it you, gentle maiden?â€ which recalled her to
herself, and reminded her the sensations which she felt were not and
could not be mutual. A sigh escaped, but it was scarce audible; and the
questions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health were
put in the tone of calm friendship. Ivanhoe answered her hastily that
he was, in point of health, as well, and better than he could have
expected--â€œThanks,â€ he said, â€œdear Rebecca, to thy helpful skill.â€

â€œHe calls me DEAR Rebecca,â€ said the maiden to herself, â€œbut it is in
the cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His war-horse--his
hunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised Jewess!â€

â€œMy mind, gentle maiden,â€ continued Ivanhoe, â€œis more disturbed by
anxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of those men who
were my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge
aright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence
on some military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-Boeuf--If so, how
will this end, or how can I protect Rowena and my father?â€

â€œHe names not the Jew or Jewess,â€ said Rebecca internally; â€œyet what is
our portion in him, and how justly am I punished by Heaven for
letting my thoughts dwell upon him!â€ She hastened after this brief
self-accusation to give Ivanhoe what information she could; but it
amounted only to this, that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the
Baron Front-de-Boeuf, were commanders within the castle; that it was
beleaguered from without, but by whom she knew not. She added, that
there was a Christian priest within the castle who might be possessed of
more information.

â€œA Christian priest!â€ said the knight, joyfully; â€œfetch him hither,
Rebecca, if thou canst--say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel--say
what thou wilt, but bring him--something I must do or attempt, but how
can I determine until I know how matters stand without?â€

Rebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to
bring Cedric into the wounded Knightâ€™s chamber, which was defeated as we
have already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been on
the watch to intercept the supposed monk. Rebecca retired to communicate
to Ivanhoe the result of her errand.

They had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of
intelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for the
noise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations which
had been considerable for some time, now increased into tenfold bustle
and clamour. The heavy, yet hasty step of the men-at-arms, traversed the
battlements or resounded on the narrow and winding passages and stairs
which led to the various bartisans and points of defence. The voices of
the knights were heard, animating their followers, or directing means
of defence, while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of
armour, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they addressed. Tremendous
as these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the awful event which
they presaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which Rebeccaâ€™s
high-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. Her eye
kindled, although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a
strong mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as she
repeated, half whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion,
the sacred text,--â€œThe quiver rattleth--the glittering spear and the
shield--the noise of the captains and the shouting!â€

But Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with
impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle in
the affray of which these sounds were the introduction. â€œIf I could
but drag myself,â€ he said, â€œto yonder window, that I might see how
this brave game is like to go--If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or
battle-axe to strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!--It
is in vain--it is in vain--I am alike nerveless and weaponless!â€

â€œFret not thyself, noble knight,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œthe sounds have
ceased of a sudden--it may be they join not battle.â€

â€œThou knowest nought of it,â€ said Wilfred, impatiently; â€œthis dead pause
only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and expecting
an instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering of
the storm--it will burst anon in all its fury.--Could I but reach yonder
window!â€

â€œThou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,â€ replied his
attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she firmly added, â€œI myself
will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what passes
without.â€

â€œYou must not--you shall not!â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe; â€œeach lattice, each
aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random shaft--â€

â€œIt shall be welcome!â€ murmured Rebecca, as with firm pace she ascended
two or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.

â€œRebecca, dear Rebecca!â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe, â€œthis is no maidenâ€™s
pastime--do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and render me for
ever miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself
with yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of your person at the
lattice as may be.â€

Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and
availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which
she placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with tolerable
security to herself, could witness part of what was passing without the
castle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were
making for the storm. Indeed the situation which she thus obtained was
peculiarly favourable for this purpose, because, being placed on an
angle of the main building, Rebecca could not only see what passed
beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of the
outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault. It was
an exterior fortification of no great height or strength, intended
to protect the postern-gate, through which Cedric had been recently
dismissed by Front-de-Boeuf. The castle moat divided this species of
barbican from the rest of the fortress, so that, in case of its being
taken, it was easy to cut off the communication with the main building,
by withdrawing the temporary bridge. In the outwork was a sallyport
corresponding to the postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded
by a strong palisade. Rebecca could observe, from the number of men
placed for the defence of this post, that the besieged entertained
apprehensions for its safety; and from the mustering of the assailants
in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it seemed no less plain
that it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack.

These appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, â€œThe
skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are
advanced from its dark shadow.â€

â€œUnder what banner?â€ asked Ivanhoe.

â€œUnder no ensign of war which I can observe,â€ answered Rebecca.

â€œA singular novelty,â€ muttered the knight, â€œto advance to storm such a
castle without pennon or banner displayed!--Seest thou who they be that
act as leaders?â€

â€œA knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,â€ said the
Jewess; â€œhe alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the
direction of all around him.â€

â€œWhat device does he bear on his shield?â€ replied Ivanhoe.

â€œSomething resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the
black shield.â€ [35]

â€œA fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œI know not who may
bear the device, but well I ween it might now be mine own. Canst thou
not see the motto?â€

â€œScarce the device itself at this distance,â€ replied Rebecca; â€œbut when
the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you.â€

â€œSeem there no other leaders?â€ exclaimed the anxious enquirer.

â€œNone of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,â€ said
Rebecca; â€œbut, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also assailed.
They appear even now preparing to advance--God of Zion, protect
us!--What a dreadful sight!--Those who advance first bear huge shields
and defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows
as they come on.--They raise their bows!--God of Moses, forgive the
creatures thou hast made!â€

Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,
which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by
a flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which,
mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the nakers, (a species of
kettle-drum,) retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy.
The shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din, the assailants
crying, â€œSaint George for merry England!â€ and the Normans answering
them with loud cries of â€œEn avant De Bracy!--Beau-seant!
Beau-seant!--Front-de-Boeuf a la rescousse!â€ according to the war-cries
of their different commanders.

It was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and
the desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous
defence on the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their
woodland pastimes to the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to
use the appropriate phrase of the time, so â€œwholly together,â€ that
no point at which a defender could show the least part of his person,
escaped their cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which
continued as thick and sharp as hail, while, notwithstanding, every
arrow had its individual aim, and flew by scores together against each
embrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as at every window where
a defender either occasionally had post, or might be suspected to be
stationed,--by this sustained discharge, two or three of the garrison
were slain, and several others wounded. But, confident in their armour
of proof, and in the cover which their situation afforded, the followers
of Front-de-Boeuf, and his allies, showed an obstinacy in defence
proportioned to the fury of the attack and replied with the discharge
of their large cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows, slings, and
other missile weapons, to the close and continued shower of arrows;
and, as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently protected, did
considerably more damage than they received at their hand. The whizzing
of shafts and of missiles, on both sides, was only interrupted by the
shouts which arose when either side inflicted or sustained some notable
loss.

â€œAnd I must lie here like a bedridden monk,â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe, â€œwhile
the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of
others!--Look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that
you are not marked by the archers beneath--Look out once more, and tell
me if they yet advance to the storm.â€

With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had
employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the lattice,
sheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.

â€œWhat dost thou see, Rebecca?â€ again demanded the wounded knight.

â€œNothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes,
and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.â€

â€œThat cannot endure,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œif they press not right on to
carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but little
against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the Fetterlock,
fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so
will his followers be.â€

â€œI see him not,â€ said Rebecca.

â€œFoul craven!â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe; â€œdoes he blench from the helm when the
wind blows highest?â€

â€œHe blenches not! he blenches not!â€ said Rebecca, â€œI see him now; he
leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican. [36]
--They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers
with axes.--His high black plume floats abroad over the throng, like
a raven over the field of the slain.--They have made a breach in the
barriers--they rush in--they are thrust back!--Front-de-Boeuf heads the
defenders; I see his gigantic form above the press. They throng again to
the breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to man. God
of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides--the conflict of two
oceans moved by adverse winds!â€

She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a
sight so terrible.

â€œLook forth again, Rebecca,â€ said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her
retiring; â€œthe archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are
now fighting hand to hand.--Look again, there is now less danger.â€

Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, â€œHoly
prophets of the law! Front-de-Boeuf and the Black Knight fight hand
to hand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the
progress of the strife--Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed
and of the captive!â€ She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, â€œHe
is down!--he is down!â€

â€œWho is down?â€ cried Ivanhoe; â€œfor our dear Ladyâ€™s sake, tell me which
has fallen?â€

â€œThe Black Knight,â€ answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again
shouted with joyful eagerness--â€œBut no--but no!--the name of the Lord
of Hosts be blessed!--he is on foot again, and fights as if there
were twenty menâ€™s strength in his single arm--His sword is broken--he
snatches an axe from a yeoman--he presses Front-de-Boeuf with blow on
blow--The giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the
woodman--he falls--he falls!â€

â€œFront-de-Boeuf?â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe.

â€œFront-de-Boeuf!â€ answered the Jewess; â€œhis men rush to the rescue,
headed by the haughty Templar--their united force compels the champion
to pause--They drag Front-de-Boeuf within the walls.â€

â€œThe assailants have won the barriers, have they not?â€ said Ivanhoe.

â€œThey have--they have!â€ exclaimed Rebecca--â€œand they press the besieged
hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and
endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other--down go stones,
beams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as fast as they
bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the
assault--Great God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should
be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!â€

â€œThink not of that,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œthis is no time for such
thoughts--Who yield?--who push their way?â€

â€œThe ladders are thrown down,â€ replied Rebecca, shuddering; â€œthe
soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles--The besieged
have the better.â€

â€œSaint George strike for us!â€ exclaimed the knight; â€œdo the false yeomen
give way?â€

â€œNo!â€ exclaimed Rebecca, â€œthey bear themselves right yeomanly--the Black
Knight approaches the postern with his huge axe--the thundering blows
which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of
the battle--Stones and beams are hailed down on the bold champion--he
regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!â€

â€œBy Saint John of Acre,â€ said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his
couch, â€œmethought there was but one man in England that might do such a
deed!â€

â€œThe postern gate shakes,â€ continued Rebecca; â€œit crashes--it is
splintered by his blows--they rush in--the outwork is won--Oh,
God!--they hurl the defenders from the battlements--they throw them
into the moat--O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no
longer!â€

â€œThe bridge--the bridge which communicates with the castle--have they
won that pass?â€ exclaimed Ivanhoe.

â€œNo,â€ replied Rebecca, â€œThe Templar has destroyed the plank on which
they crossed--few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle--the
shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others--Alas!--I
see it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle.â€

â€œWhat do they now, maiden?â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œlook forth yet again--this is
no time to faint at bloodshed.â€

â€œIt is over for the time,â€ answered Rebecca; â€œour friends strengthen
themselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and it affords
them so good a shelter from the foemenâ€™s shot, that the garrison only
bestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as if rather to
disquiet than effectually to injure them.â€

â€œOur friends,â€ said Wilfred, â€œwill surely not abandon an enterprise so
gloriously begun and so happily attained.--O no! I will put my faith
in the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of
iron.--Singular,â€ he again muttered to himself, â€œif there be two who can
do a deed of such derring-do! [37]--a fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on
a field sable--what may that mean?--seest thou nought else, Rebecca, by
which the Black Knight may be distinguished?â€

â€œNothing,â€ said the Jewess; â€œall about him is black as the wing of the
night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further--but having
once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know
him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he were
summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there seems as
if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every
blow which he deals upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the sin of
bloodshed!--it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and
heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.â€

â€œRebecca,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œthou hast painted a hero; surely they rest
but to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the
moat--Under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there
are no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant
emprize; since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also
glorious. I swear by the honour of my house--I vow by the name of my
bright lady-love, I would endure ten yearsâ€™ captivity to fight one day
by that good knightâ€™s side in such a quarrel as this!â€

â€œAlas,â€ said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and approaching
the couch of the wounded knight, â€œthis impatient yearning after
action--this struggling with and repining at your present weakness,
will not fail to injure your returning health--How couldst thou hope
to inflict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast
received?â€

â€œRebecca,â€ he replied, â€œthou knowest not how impossible it is for one
trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a
woman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of
battle is the food upon which we live--the dust of the â€˜meleeâ€™ is the
breath of our nostrils! We live not--we wish not to live--longer than
while we are victorious and renowned--Such, maiden, are the laws of
chivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold
dear.â€

â€œAlas!â€ said the fair Jewess, â€œand what is it, valiant knight, save an
offering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing through
the fire to Moloch?--What remains to you as the prize of all the blood
you have spilled--of all the travail and pain you have endured--of
all the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the
strong manâ€™s spear, and overtaken the speed of his war-horse?â€

â€œWhat remains?â€ cried Ivanhoe; â€œGlory, maiden, glory! which gilds our
sepulchre and embalms our name.â€

â€œGlory?â€ continued Rebecca; â€œalas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a
hatchment over the championâ€™s dim and mouldering tomb--is the defaced
sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to
the enquiring pilgrim--are these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice
of every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may
make others miserable? Or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of
a wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and
happiness, are so wildly bartered, to become the hero of those ballads
which vagabond minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?â€

â€œBy the soul of Hereward!â€ replied the knight impatiently, â€œthou
speakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quench the pure
light of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base,
the gentle knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our life
far, far beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over
pain, toil, and suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace.
Thou art no Christian, Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high
feelings which swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover hath
done some deed of emprize which sanctions his flame. Chivalry!--why,
maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection--the stay of the
oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the
tyrant--Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds
the best protection in her lance and her sword.â€

â€œI am, indeed,â€ said Rebecca, â€œsprung from a race whose courage was
distinguished in the defence of their own land, but who warred not, even
while yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in defending
their country from oppression. The sound of the trumpet wakes Judah no
longer, and her despised children are now but the unresisting victims
of hostile and military oppression. Well hast thou spoken, Sir
Knight,--until the God of Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a
second Gideon, or a new Maccabeus, it ill beseemeth the Jewish damsel to
speak of battle or of war.â€

The high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow, which
deeply expressed her sense of the degradation of her people, embittered
perhaps by the idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not entitled
to interfere in a case of honour, and incapable of entertaining or
expressing sentiments of honour and generosity.

â€œHow little he knows this bosom,â€ she said, â€œto imagine that cowardice
or meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because I have censured
the fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the
shedding of mine own blood, drop by drop, could redeem the captivity of
Judah! Nay, would to God it could avail to set free my father, and this
his benefactor, from the chains of the oppressor! The proud Christian
should then see whether the daughter of Godâ€™s chosen people dared not to
die as bravely as the vainest Nazarene maiden, that boasts her descent
from some petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north!â€

She then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.

â€œHe sleeps,â€ she said; â€œnature exhausted by sufferance and the waste
of spirits, his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary
relaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look
upon him, when it may be for the last time?--When yet but a short space,
and those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and
buoyant spirit which forsakes them not even in sleep!--When the nostril
shall be distended, the mouth agape, the eyes fixed and bloodshot; and
when the proud and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest caitiff
of this accursed castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up against
him!--And my father!--oh, my father! evil is it with his daughter,
when his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden locks of
youth!--What know I but that these evils are the messengers of Jehovahâ€™s
wrath to the unnatural child, who thinks of a strangerâ€™s captivity
before a parentâ€™s? who forgets the desolation of Judah, and looks upon
the comeliness of a Gentile and a stranger?--But I will tear this folly
from my heart, though every fibre bleed as I rend it away!â€

She wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance
from the couch of the wounded knight, with her back turned towards it,
fortifying, or endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against
the impending evils from without, but also against those treacherous
feelings which assailed her from within.




CHAPTER XXX

     Approach the chamber, look upon his bed.
     His is the passing of no peaceful ghost,
     Which, as the lark arises to the sky,
     â€˜Mid morningâ€™s sweetest breeze and softest dew,
     Is wingâ€™d to heaven by good menâ€™s sighs and tears!--
     Anselm parts otherwise.
     --Old Play

During the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the
besiegers, while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage,
and the other to strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De
Bracy held brief council together in the hall of the castle.

â€œWhere is Front-de-Boeuf?â€ said the latter, who had superintended the
defence of the fortress on the other side; â€œmen say he hath been slain.â€

â€œHe lives,â€ said the Templar, coolly, â€œlives as yet; but had he worn the
bullâ€™s head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of iron to fence
it withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a few
hours, and Front-de-Boeuf is with his fathers--a powerful limb lopped
off Prince Johnâ€™s enterprise.â€

â€œAnd a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,â€ said De Bracy; â€œthis
comes of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images of holy things
and holy men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen.â€

â€œGo to--thou art a fool,â€ said the Templar; â€œthy superstition is upon a
level with Front-de-Boeufâ€™s want of faith; neither of you can render a
reason for your belief or unbelief.â€

â€œBenedicite, Sir Templar,â€ replied De Bracy, â€œpray you to keep better
rule with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By the Mother of
Heaven, I am a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for
the â€˜bruitâ€™ goeth shrewdly out, that the most holy Order of the Temple
of Zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian
de Bois-Guilbert is of the number.â€

â€œCare not thou for such reports,â€ said the Templar; â€œbut let us think of
making good the castle.--How fought these villain yeomen on thy side?â€

â€œLike fiends incarnate,â€ said De Bracy. â€œThey swarmed close up to
the walls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize at the
archery, for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurseâ€™s
boasted policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us!
Had I not been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven
times with as little remorse as if I had been a buck in season. He told
every rivet on my armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against
my ribs with as little compunction as if my bones had been of iron--But
that I wore a shirt of Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been
fairly sped.â€

â€œBut you maintained your post?â€ said the Templar. â€œWe lost the outwork
on our part.â€

â€œThat is a shrewd loss,â€ said De Bracy; â€œthe knaves will find cover
there to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not well watched,
gain some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and
so break in upon us. Our numbers are too few for the defence of every
point, and the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but
they are the mark for as many arrows as a parish-butt on a holyday even.
Front-de-Boeuf is dying too, so we shall receive no more aid from his
bullâ€™s head and brutal strength. How think you, Sir Brian, were we
not better make a virtue of necessity, and compound with the rogues by
delivering up our prisoners?â€

â€œHow?â€ exclaimed the Templar; â€œdeliver up our prisoners, and stand an
object alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who
dared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party
of defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle
against a vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the
very refuse of mankind?--Shame on thy counsel, Maurice de Bracy!--The
ruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I consent
to such base and dishonourable composition.â€

â€œLet us to the walls, then,â€ said De Bracy, carelessly; â€œthat man never
breathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter rate than I
do. But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two
scores of my gallant troop of Free Companions?--Oh, my brave lances! if
ye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should
I see my banner at the head of your clump of spears! And how short while
would these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter!â€

â€œWish for whom thou wilt,â€ said the Templar, â€œbut let us make
what defence we can with the soldiers who remain--They are chiefly
Front-de-Boeufâ€™s followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of
insolence and oppression.â€

â€œThe better,â€ said De Bracy; â€œthe rugged slaves will defend themselves
to the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of the
peasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert;
and, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice de Bracy bear himself this day
as a gentleman of blood and lineage.â€

â€œTo the walls!â€ answered the Templar; and they both ascended the
battlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish,
in defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest
danger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had
possessed themselves. The castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican
by the moat, and it was impossible that the besiegers could assail the
postern-door, with which the outwork corresponded, without surmounting
that obstacle; but it was the opinion both of the Templar and De Bracy,
that the besiegers, if governed by the same policy their leader had
already displayed, would endeavour, by a formidable assault, to draw
the chief part of the defendersâ€™ observation to this point, and take
measures to avail themselves of every negligence which might take place
in the defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their numbers
only permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to space along
the walls in communication with each other, who might give the alarm
whenever danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that De Bracy
should command the defence at the postern, and the Templar should keep
with him a score of men or thereabouts as a body of reserve, ready to
hasten to any other point which might be suddenly threatened. The loss
of the barbican had also this unfortunate effect, that, notwithstanding
the superior height of the castle walls, the besieged could not see from
them, with the same precision as before, the operations of the enemy;
for some straggling underwood approached so near the sallyport of the
outwork, that the assailants might introduce into it whatever force they
thought proper, not only under cover, but even without the knowledge of
the defenders. Utterly uncertain, therefore, upon what point the storm
was to burst, De Bracy and his companion were under the necessity of
providing against every possible contingency, and their followers,
however brave, experienced the anxious dejection of mind incident to men
enclosed by enemies, who possessed the power of choosing their time and
mode of attack.

Meanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon
a bed of bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usual resource of
bigots in that superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone for
the crimes they were guilty of by liberality to the church, stupefying
by this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and forgiveness;
and although the refuge which success thus purchased, was no more like
to the peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance, than the
turbid stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy and natural
slumbers, it was still a state of mind preferable to the agonies of
awakened remorse. But among the vices of Front-de-Boeuf, a hard and
griping man, avarice was predominant; and he preferred setting church
and churchmen at defiance, to purchasing from them pardon and absolution
at the price of treasure and of manors. Nor did the Templar, an infidel
of another stamp, justly characterise his associate, when he said
Front-de-Boeuf could assign no cause for his unbelief and contempt for
the established faith; for the Baron would have alleged that the Church
sold her wares too dear, that the spiritual freedom which she put up to
sale was only to be bought like that of the chief captain of Jerusalem,
â€œwith a great sum,â€ and Front-de-Boeuf preferred denying the virtue of
the medicine, to paying the expense of the physician.

But the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were
gliding from before his eyes, and when the savage Baronâ€™s heart, though
hard as a nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into the
waste darkness of futurity. The fever of his body aided the impatience
and agony of his mind, and his death-bed exhibited a mixture of
the newly awakened feelings of horror, combating with the fixed and
inveterate obstinacy of his disposition;--a fearful state of mind, only
to be equalled in those tremendous regions, where there are complaints
without hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense of present
agony, and a presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished!

â€œWhere be these dog-priests now,â€ growled the Baron, â€œwho set such price
on their ghostly mummery?--where be all those unshod Carmelites, for
whom old Front-de-Boeuf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing his heir
of many a fair rood of meadow, and many a fat field and close--where be
the greedy hounds now?--Swilling, I warrant me, at the ale, or playing
their juggling tricks at the bedside of some miserly churl.--Me, the
heir of their founder--me, whom their foundation binds them to pray
for--me--ungrateful villains as they are!--they suffer to die like the
houseless dog on yonder common, unshriven and unhouseled!--Tell the
Templar to come hither--he is a priest, and may do something--But
no!--as well confess myself to the devil as to Brian de Bois-Guilbert,
who recks neither of heaven nor of hell.--I have heard old men talk of
prayer--prayer by their own voice--Such need not to court or to bribe
the false priest--But I--I dare not!â€

â€œLives Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,â€ said a broken and shrill voice close by
his bedside, â€œto say there is that which he dares not!â€

The evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-Boeuf heard, in
this strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those
demons, who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the
beds of dying men to distract their thoughts, and turn them from the
meditations which concerned their eternal welfare. He shuddered and drew
himself together; but, instantly summoning up his wonted resolution, he
exclaimed, â€œWho is there?--what art thou, that darest to echo my words
in a tone like that of the night-raven?--Come before my couch that I may
see thee.â€

â€œI am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,â€ replied the voice.

â€œLet me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou beâ€™st indeed a
fiend,â€ replied the dying knight; â€œthink not that I will blench from
thee.--By the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors
that hover round me, as I have done with mortal dangers, heaven or hell
should never say that I shrunk from the conflict!â€

â€œThink on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,â€ said the almost unearthly
voice, â€œon rebellion, on rapine, on murder!--Who stirred up the
licentious John to war against his grey-headed father--against his
generous brother?â€

â€œBe thou fiend, priest, or devil,â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthou liest
in thy throat!--Not I stirred John to rebellion--not I alone--there were
fifty knights and barons, the flower of the midland counties--better
men never laid lance in rest--And must I answer for the fault done
by fifty?--False fiend, I defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no
more--let me die in peace if thou be mortal--if thou be a demon, thy
time is not yet come.â€

â€œIn peace thou shalt NOT die,â€ repeated the voice; â€œeven in death
shalt thou think on thy murders--on the groans which this castle has
echoed--on the blood that is engrained in its floors!â€

â€œThou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,â€ answered Front-de-Boeuf,
with a ghastly and constrained laugh. â€œThe infidel Jew--it was merit
with heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore are men canonized
who dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?--The Saxon porkers, whom I
have slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my lineage, and
of my liege lord.--Ho! ho! thou seest there is no crevice in my coat of
plate--Art thou fled?--art thou silenced?â€

â€œNo, foul parricide!â€ replied the voice; â€œthink of thy father!--think
of his death!--think of his banquet-room flooded with his gore, and that
poured forth by the hand of a son!â€

â€œHa!â€ answered the Baron, after a long pause, â€œan thou knowest that,
thou art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as the monks call
thee!--That secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in that of one
besides--the temptress, the partaker of my guilt.--Go, leave me, fiend!
and seek the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee what she
and I alone witnessed.--Go, I say, to her, who washed the wounds, and
straighted the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of
one parted in time and in the course of nature--Go to her, she was my
temptress, the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed--let
her, as well as I, taste of the tortures which anticipate hell!â€

â€œShe already tastes them,â€ said Ulrica, stepping before the couch of
Front-de-Boeuf; â€œshe hath long drunken of this cup, and its bitterness
is now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.--Grind not thy teeth,
Front-de-Boeuf--roll not thine eyes--clench not thine hand, nor shake
it at me with that gesture of menace!--The hand which, like that of thy
renowned ancestor who gained thy name, could have broken with one stroke
the skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as mine
own!â€

â€œVile murderous hag!â€ replied Front-de-Boeuf; â€œdetestable screech-owl!
it is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thou hast assisted
to lay low?â€

â€œAy, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf,â€ answered she, â€œit is Ulrica!--it is the
daughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!--it is the sister of his
slaughtered sons!--it is she who demands of thee, and of thy fatherâ€™s
house, father and kindred, name and fame--all that she has lost by the
name of Front-de-Boeuf!--Think of my wrongs, Front-de-Boeuf, and answer
me if I speak not truth. Thou hast been my evil angel, and I will be
thine--I will dog thee till the very instant of dissolution!â€

â€œDetestable fury!â€ exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, â€œthat moment shalt thou
never witness--Ho! Giles, Clement, and Eustace! Saint Maur, and Stephen!
seize this damned witch, and hurl her from the battlements headlong--she
has betrayed us to the Saxon!--Ho! Saint Maur! Clement! false-hearted,
knaves, where tarry ye?â€

â€œCall on them again, valiant Baron,â€ said the hag, with a smile of
grisly mockery; â€œsummon thy vassals around thee, doom them that loiter
to the scourge and the dungeon--But know, mighty chief,â€ she continued,
suddenly changing her tone, â€œthou shalt have neither answer, nor aid,
nor obedience at their hands.--Listen to these horrid sounds,â€ for the
din of the recommenced assault and defence now rung fearfully loud from
the battlements of the castle; â€œin that war-cry is the downfall of thy
house--The blood-cemented fabric of Front-de-Boeufâ€™s power totters
to the foundation, and before the foes he most despised!--The Saxon,
Reginald!--the scorned Saxon assails thy walls!--Why liest thou here,
like a worn-out hind, when the Saxon storms thy place of strength?â€

â€œGods and fiends!â€ exclaimed the wounded knight; â€œO, for one momentâ€™s
strength, to drag myself to the â€˜meleeâ€™, and perish as becomes my name!â€

â€œThink not of it, valiant warrior!â€ replied she; â€œthou shalt die no
soldierâ€™s death, but perish like the fox in his den, when the peasants
have set fire to the cover around it.â€

â€œHateful hag! thou liest!â€ exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf; â€œmy followers bear
them bravely--my walls are strong and high--my comrades in arms fear
not a whole host of Saxons, were they headed by Hengist and Horsa!--The
war-cry of the Templar and of the Free Companions rises high over the
conflict! And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon, for joy
of our defence, it shall consume thee, body and bones; and I shall live
to hear thou art gone from earthly fires to those of that hell, which
never sent forth an incarnate fiend more utterly diabolical!â€

â€œHold thy belief,â€ replied Ulrica, â€œtill the proof reach thee--But, no!â€
 she said, interrupting herself, â€œthou shalt know, even now, the doom,
which all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable to avoid,
though it is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thou the
smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds
through the chamber?--Didst thou think it was but the darkening of
thy bursting eyes--the difficulty of thy cumbered breathing?--No!
Front-de-Boeuf, there is another cause--Rememberest thou the magazine of
fuel that is stored beneath these apartments?â€

â€œWoman!â€ he exclaimed with fury, â€œthou hast not set fire to it?--By
heaven, thou hast, and the castle is in flames!â€

â€œThey are fast rising at least,â€ said Ulrica, with frightful composure;
â€œand a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon
those who would extinguish them.--Farewell, Front-de-Boeuf!--May Mista,
Skogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient Saxons--fiends, as the
priests now call them--supply the place of comforters at your dying bed,
which Ulrica now relinquishes!--But know, if it will give thee comfort
to know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with thyself,
the companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guilt.--And now,
parricide, farewell for ever!--May each stone of this vaulted roof find
a tongue to echo that title into thine ear!â€

So saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-Boeuf could hear the
crash of the ponderous key, as she locked and double-locked the door
behind her, thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the
extremity of agony he shouted upon his servants and allies--â€œStephen and
Saint Maur!--Clement and Giles!--I burn here unaided!--To the rescue--to
the rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert, valiant De Bracy!--It is Front-de-Boeuf
who calls!--It is your master, ye traitor squires!--Your ally--your
brother in arms, ye perjured and faithless knights!--all the curses due
to traitors upon your recreant heads, do you abandon me to perish thus
miserably!--They hear me not--they cannot hear me--my voice is lost in
the din of battle.--The smoke rolls thicker and thicker--the fire has
caught upon the floor below--O, for one drought of the air of heaven,
were it to be purchased by instant annihilation!â€ And in the mad frenzy
of despair, the wretch now shouted with the shouts of the fighters, now
muttered curses on himself, on mankind, and on Heaven itself.--â€œThe red
fire flashes through the thick smoke!â€ he exclaimed; â€œthe demon marches
against me under the banner of his own element--Foul spirit, avoid!--I
go not with thee without my comrades--all, all are thine, that garrison
these walls--Thinkest thou Front-de-Boeuf will be singled out to go
alone?--No--the infidel Templar--the licentious De Bracy--Ulrica, the
foul murdering strumpet--the men who aided my enterprises--the dog
Saxons and accursed Jews, who are my prisoners--all, all shall attend
me--a goodly fellowship as ever took the downward road--Ha, ha, ha!â€ and
he laughed in his frenzy till the vaulted roof rang again. â€œWho laughed
there?â€ exclaimed Front-de-Boeuf, in altered mood, for the noise of
the conflict did not prevent the echoes of his own mad laughter
from returning upon his ear--â€œwho laughed there?--Ulrica, was it
thou?--Speak, witch, and I forgive thee--for, only thou or the fiend of
hell himself could have laughed at such a moment. Avaunt--avaunt!---â€

But it were impious to trace any farther the picture of the blasphemer
and parricideâ€™s deathbed.




CHAPTER XXXI

     Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,
     Or, close the wall up with our English dead.
     -------And you, good yeomen,
     Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
     The mettle of your pasture--let us swear
     That you are worth your breeding.
     King Henry V

Cedric, although not greatly confident in Ulricaâ€™s message, omitted not
to communicate her promise to the Black Knight and Locksley. They were
well pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in
the moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily
agreed with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought
to be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in
the hands of the cruel Front-de-Boeuf.

â€œThe royal blood of Alfred is endangered,â€ said Cedric.

â€œThe honour of a noble lady is in peril,â€ said the Black Knight.

â€œAnd, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,â€ said the good yeoman,
â€œwere there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave,
Wamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.â€

â€œAnd so would I,â€ said the Friar; â€œwhat, sirs! I trust well that a
fool--I mean, dâ€™ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild and
master of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup of
wine as ever a flitch of bacon can--I say, brethren, such a fool shall
never want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait, while
I can say a mass or flourish a partisan.â€ And with that he made his
heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his
light crook.

â€œTrue, Holy Clerk,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œtrue as if Saint Dunstan
himself had said it.--And now, good Locksley, were it not well that
noble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?â€

â€œNot a jot I,â€ returned Cedric; â€œI have never been wont to study either
how to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which
the Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the
foremost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier
in the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.â€

â€œSince it stands thus with noble Cedric,â€ said Locksley, â€œI am most
willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang
me up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show
themselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as
there are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.â€

â€œWell said, stout yeoman,â€ answered the Black Knight; â€œand if I be
thought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among
these brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight,
for so I may surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my
experience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.â€

The parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the
first assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.

When the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the
happy event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such
a strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from
combining their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork
which they had lost. This the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding,
conscious that the men whom he led, being hasty and untrained
volunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must, upon
any sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the veteran soldiers
of the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both defensive
and offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of the
besiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect discipline
and the habitual use of weapons.

The knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of
floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the
moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some
time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure to
execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.

When the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the
besiegers:--â€œIt avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is
descending to the west--and I have that upon my hands which will not
permit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel if
the horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily accomplish
our purpose. Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid him commence a
discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward
as if about to assault it; and you, true English hearts, stand by me,
and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the moat whenever the
postern on our side is thrown open. Follow me boldly across, and aid me
to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the castle. As many of you as
like not this service, or are but ill armed to meet it, do you man the
top of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to your ears, and mind you
quell with your shot whatever shall appear to man the rampart--Noble
Cedric, wilt thou take the direction of those which remain?â€

â€œNot so, by the soul of Hereward!â€ said the Saxon; â€œlead I cannot; but
may posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the foremost
wherever thou shalt point the way--The quarrel is mine, and well it
becomes me to be in the van of the battle.â€

â€œYet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,â€ said the knight, â€œthou hast neither
hauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and
sword.â€

â€œThe better!â€ answered Cedric; â€œI shall be the lighter to climb these
walls. And,--forgive the boast, Sir Knight,--thou shalt this day see
the naked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye
beheld the steel corslet of a Norman.â€

â€œIn the name of God, then,â€ said the knight, â€œfling open the door, and
launch the floating bridge.â€

The portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat,
and which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle,
was now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward,
and soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle
and outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men
abreast to cross the moat. Well aware of the importance of taking the
foe by surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw
himself upon the bridge, and reached the opposite side. Here he began to
thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from
the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former
drawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat from the
barbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of
the portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two were
instantly shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the moat;
the others retreated back into the barbican.

The situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly dangerous,
and would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the
archers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon
the battlements, distracting the attention of those by whom they were
manned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the
storm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them. But their
situation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every
moment.

â€œShame on ye all!â€ cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; â€œdo ye
call yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station
under the walls of the castle?--Heave over the coping stones from the
battlements, an better may not be--Get pick-axe and levers, and down
with that huge pinnacle!â€ pointing to a heavy piece of stone carved-work
that projected from the parapet.

At this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the angle
of the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout yeoman
Locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to the
outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.

â€œSaint George!â€ he cried, â€œMerry Saint George for England!--To the
charge, bold yeomen!--why leave ye the good knight and noble Cedric to
storm the pass alone?--make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for
thy rosary,--make in, brave yeomen!--the castle is ours, we have friends
within--See yonder flag, it is the appointed signal--Torquilstone is
ours!--Think of honour, think of spoil--One effort, and the place is
ours!â€

With that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the
breast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracyâ€™s direction, was
loosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the
heads of Cedric and the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the
hands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and
had loosened the stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his
head-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man.
The men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the
shot of this tremendous archer.

â€œDo you give ground, base knaves!â€ said De Bracy; â€œâ€˜Mount joye Saint
Dennis!â€™--Give me the lever!â€

And, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which was
of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the remnant
of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants, but also
to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had crossed. All
saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar himself, avoided
setting foot on the raft. Thrice did Locksley bend his shaft against De
Bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knightâ€™s armour of
proof.

â€œCurse on thy Spanish steel-coat!â€ said Locksley, â€œhad English smith
forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or
sendal.â€ He then began to call out, â€œComrades! friends! noble Cedric!
bear back, and let the ruin fall.â€

His warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself
occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty
war-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked
bridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him.
But his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already
tottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have
accomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his
ears:--

â€œAll is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.â€

â€œThou art mad to say so!â€ replied the knight.

â€œIt is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain
to extinguish it.â€

With the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian
de Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not
so calmly received by his astonished comrade.

â€œSaints of Paradise!â€ said De Bracy; â€œwhat is to be done? I vow to Saint
Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold--â€

â€œSpare thy vow,â€ said the Templar, â€œand mark me. Lead thy men down, as
if to a sally; throw the postern-gate open--There are but two men who
occupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the
barbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on
the outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend
ourselves until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair
quarter.â€

â€œIt is well thought upon,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI will play my part--Templar,
thou wilt not fail me?â€

â€œHand and glove, I will not!â€ said Bois-Guilbert. â€œBut haste thee, in
the name of God!â€

De Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the
postern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce
was this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced his
way inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the foremost
instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leaderâ€™s
efforts to stop them.

â€œDogs!â€ said De Bracy, â€œwill ye let TWO men win our only pass for
safety?â€

â€œHe is the devil!â€ said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the
blows of their sable antagonist.

â€œAnd if he be the devil,â€ replied De Bracy, â€œwould you fly from him into
the mouth of hell?--the castle burns behind us, villains!--let despair
give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this champion
myself.â€

And well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had
acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage
to which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted
champions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows
which they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight
with his ponderous axe. At length the Norman received a blow, which,
though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never
more would De Bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such
violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.

â€œYield thee, De Bracy,â€ said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and
holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the
knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of
mercy,)--â€œyield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou art
but a dead man.â€

â€œI will not yield,â€ replied De Bracy faintly, â€œto an unknown conqueror.
Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me--it shall never be said
that Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.â€

The Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.

â€œI yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,â€ answered the
Norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of
deep though sullen submission.

â€œGo to the barbican,â€ said the victor, in a tone of authority, â€œand
there wait my further orders.â€

â€œYet first, let me say,â€ said De Bracy, â€œwhat it imports thee to know.
Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the
burning castle without present help.â€

â€œWilfred of Ivanhoe!â€ exclaimed the Black Knight--â€œprisoner, and
perish!--The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair
of his head be singed--Show me his chamber!â€

â€œAscend yonder winding stair,â€ said De Bracy; â€œit leads to his
apartment--Wilt thou not accept my guidance?â€ he added, in a submissive
voice.

â€œNo. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De
Bracy.â€

During this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at
the head of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had
pushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and drove
back the dispirited and despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom some
asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part fled
towards the court-yard. De Bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast
a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. â€œHe trusts me not!â€ he repeated;
â€œbut have I deserved his trust?â€ He then lifted his sword from the
floor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the
barbican, gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way.

As the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the
chamber, where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He
had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and
his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at
the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was
for some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the
smouldering and stifling vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which
rolled into the apartment--the cries for water, which were heard even
above the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this
new danger.

â€œThe castle burns,â€ said Rebecca; â€œit burns!--What can we do to save
ourselves?â€

â€œFly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œfor no human aid
can avail me.â€

â€œI will not fly,â€ answered Rebecca; â€œwe will be saved or perish
together--And yet, great God!--my father, my father--what will be his
fate!â€

At this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar
presented himself,--a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken
and bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his
casque. â€œI have found thee,â€ said he to Rebecca; â€œthou shalt prove I
will keep my word to share weal and woe with thee--There is but one
path to safety, I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to
thee--up, and instantly follow me!â€ [38]

â€œAlone,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œI will not follow thee. If thou wert born of
woman--if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee--if thy heart
be not hard as thy breastplate--save my aged father--save this wounded
knight!â€

â€œA knight,â€ answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, â€œa
knight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the
shape of sword or flame--and who recks how or where a Jew meets with
his?â€

â€œSavage warrior,â€ said Rebecca, â€œrather will I perish in the flames than
accept safety from thee!â€

â€œThou shalt not choose, Rebecca--once didst thou foil me, but never
mortal did so twice.â€

So saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with
her shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her
cries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe
thundered against him. â€œHound of the Temple--stain to thine Order--set
free the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands
thee!--Villain, I will have thy heartâ€™s blood!â€

â€œI had not found thee, Wilfred,â€ said the Black Knight, who at that
instant entered the apartment, â€œbut for thy shouts.â€

â€œIf thou beâ€™st true knight,â€ said Wilfred, â€œthink not of me--pursue yon
ravisher--save the Lady Rowena--look to the noble Cedric!â€

â€œIn their turn,â€ answered he of the Fetterlock, â€œbut thine is first.â€

And seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the
Templar had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and
having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again
entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.

One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from
window and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the
walls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress
of the flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce
more dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued
the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in
their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the
soldiers of the tyrant Front-de-Boeuf. Most of the garrison resisted to
the uttermost--few of them asked quarter--none received it. The air was
filled with groans and clashing of arms--the floors were slippery with
the blood of despairing and expiring wretches.

Through this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena, while
the faithful Gurth, following him closely through the â€œmeleeâ€, neglected
his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at
his master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his wardâ€™s
apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a
crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant
death. He committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted in
safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy,
and not yet interrupted by the flames. This accomplished, the loyal
Cedric hastened in quest of his friend Athelstane, determined, at every
risk to himself, to save that last scion of Saxon royalty. But ere
Cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been
a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had procured liberation for
himself and his companion in adversity.

When the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the
Jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, â€œSaint George
and the dragon!--Bonny Saint George for merry England!--The castle is
won!â€ And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging against
each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered
around the hall.

A guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and
whose spirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wambaâ€™s
clamour, and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the Templar
that foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners found no
difficulty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from thence
into the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of contest.
Here sat the fierce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded by several
of the garrison both on horse and foot, who had united their strength
to that of this renowned leader, in order to secure the last chance
of safety and retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge had been
lowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers, who
had hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their missiles, no
sooner saw the flames breaking out, and the bridge lowered, than they
thronged to the entrance, as well to prevent the escape of the garrison,
as to secure their own share of booty ere the castle should be burnt
down. On the other hand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by
the postern were now issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with
fury the remnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides
at once.

Animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their
indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with
the utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in
driving back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca,
placed on horseback before one of the Templarâ€™s Saracen slaves, was in
the midst of the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the
confusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety.
Repeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held
before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon
starting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward,
struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same
instant once more at her bridle rein.

Athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,
beheld the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and
doubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in
despite of all resistance which could be offered.

â€œBy the soul of Saint Edward,â€ he said, â€œI will rescue her from yonder
over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!â€

â€œThink what you do!â€ cried Wamba; â€œhasty hand catches frog for fish--by
my bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena--see but her long dark
locks!--Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but
I will be no follower--no bones of mine shall be broken unless I know
for whom.--And you without armour too!--Bethink you, silk bonnet never
kept out steel blade.--Nay, then, if wilful will to water, wilful must
drench.--â€˜Deus vobiscumâ€™, most doughty Athelstane!â€--he concluded,
loosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the Saxonâ€™s tunic.

To snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose
dying grasp had just relinquished it--to rush on the Templarâ€™s band, and
to strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior
at each blow, was, for Athelstaneâ€™s great strength, now animated with
unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two
yards of Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest tone.

â€œTurn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to
touch--turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!â€

â€œDog!â€ said the Templar, grinding his teeth, â€œI will teach thee to
blaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;â€ and with these words,
half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon, and
rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of
the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.

Well said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So
trenchant was the Templarâ€™s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had
been a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the
ill-fated Saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head,
levelled him with the earth.

â€œâ€˜Ha! Beau-seant!â€™â€ exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, â€œthus be it to the
maligners of the Temple-knights!â€ Taking advantage of the dismay which
was spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, â€œThose who
would save themselves, follow me!â€ he pushed across the drawbridge,
dispersing the archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed
by his Saracens, and some five or six men-at-arms, who had mounted their
horses. The Templarâ€™s retreat was rendered perilous by the numbers of
arrows shot off at him and his party; but this did not prevent him from
galloping round to the barbican, of which, according to his previous
plan, he supposed it possible De Bracy might have been in possession.

â€œDe Bracy! De Bracy!â€ he shouted, â€œart thou there?â€

â€œI am here,â€ replied De Bracy, â€œbut I am a prisoner.â€

â€œCan I rescue thee?â€ cried Bois-Guilbert.

â€œNo,â€ replied De Bracy; â€œI have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I will
be true prisoner. Save thyself--there are hawks abroad--put the seas
betwixt you and England--I dare not say more.â€

â€œWell,â€ answered the Templar, â€œan thou wilt tarry there, remember I
have redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks
the walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient, and
thither will I, like heron to her haunt.â€

Having thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.

Those of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued
to fight desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the
Templar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained any
hope of escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of the
castle, when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a turret, in
the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a war-song, such
as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the scalds of the
yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew back from her
uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified vengeance contended
in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she brandished the distaff
which she held in her hand, as if she had been one of the Fatal Sisters,
who spin and abridge the thread of human life. Tradition has preserved
some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn which she chanted wildly amid
that scene of fire and of slaughter:--

     1.
     Whet the bright steel,
     Sons of the White Dragon!
     Kindle the torch,
     Daughter of Hengist!
     The steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet,
     It is hard, broad, and sharply pointed;
     The torch goeth not to the bridal chamber,
     It steams and glitters blue with sulphur.
     Whet the steel, the raven croaks!
     Light the torch, Zernebock is yelling!
     Whet the steel, sons of the Dragon!
     Kindle the torch, daughter of Hengist!

     2.
     The black cloud is low over the thaneâ€™s castle
     The eagle screams--he rides on its bosom.
     Scream not, grey rider of the sable cloud,
     Thy banquet is prepared!
     The maidens of Valhalla look forth,
     The race of Hengist will send them guests.
     Shake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla!
     And strike your loud timbrels for joy!
     Many a haughty step bends to your halls,
     Many a helmed head.

     3.
     Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,
     The black clouds gather round;
     Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!
     The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against
     them.
     He, the bright consumer of palaces,
     Broad waves he his blazing banner,
     Red, wide and dusky,
     Over the strife of the valiant:
     His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;
     He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the
     wound!

     4.
     All must perish!
     The sword cleaveth the helmet;
     The strong armour is pierced by the lance;
     Fire devoureth the dwelling of princes,
     Engines break down the fences of the battle.
     All must perish!
     The race of Hengist is gone--
     The name of Horsa is no more!
     Shrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword!
     Let your blades drink blood like wine;
     Feast ye in the banquet of slaughter,
     By the light of the blazing halls!
     Strong be your swords while your blood is warm,
     And spare neither for pity nor fear,
     For vengeance hath but an hour;
     Strong hate itself shall expire
     I also must perish! [39]

The towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to
the evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through
the adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof
and rafter; and the combatants were driven from the court-yard. The
vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the
neighbouring wood. The victors, assembling in large bands, gazed with
wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in which their own ranks
and arms glanced dusky red. The maniac figure of the Saxon Ulrica was
for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing
her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined empress of the
conflagration which she had raised. At length, with a terrific crash,
the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the flames which had
consumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced each murmur of
the armed spectators, who, for the space of several minutes, stirred not
a finger, save to sign the cross. The voice of Locksley was then heard,
â€œShout, yeomen!--the den of tyrants is no more! Let each bring his
spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the Trysting-tree in the
Harthill-walk; for there at break of day will we make just partition
among our own bands, together with our worthy allies in this great deed
of vengeance.â€




CHAPTER XXXII.

     Trust me each state must have its policies:
     Kingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;
     Even the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,
     Keeps yet some touch of civil discipline;
     For not since Adam wore his verdant apron,
     Hath man with man in social union dwelt,
     But laws were made to draw that union closer.
     --Old Play

The daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green
boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn
from the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood,
and no huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he
paced at the head of the antlerâ€™d herd.

The outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the
Harthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves
after the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber, many
with hearing and recounting the events of the day, and computing the
heaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of their
Chief.

The spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was
consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,
had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be
appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. Yet so strict were
the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any
part of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the
disposal of their leader.

The place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
Locksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the story,
but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a
mile of the demolished castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley assumed his
seat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. He assigned to
the Black Knight a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a place upon
his left.

â€œPardon my freedom, noble sirs,â€ he said, â€œbut in these glades I am
monarch--they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck but
little of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to
mortal man.--Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our curtal
Friar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.â€--No one
had seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. â€œOver gods forbode!â€ said the outlaw
chief, â€œI trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a
thought too late. Who saw him since the castle was taâ€™en?â€

â€œI,â€ quoth the Miller, â€œmarked him busy about the door of a cellar,
swearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of
Front-de-Boeufâ€™s Gascoigne wine.â€

â€œNow, the saints, as many as there be of them,â€ said the Captain,
â€œforefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished by
the fall of the castle!--Away, Miller!--take with you enow of men,
seek the place where you last saw him--throw water from the moat on the
scorching ruins--I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my
curtal Friar.â€

The numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an
interesting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much
the troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.

â€œMeanwhile, let us proceed,â€ said Locksley; â€œfor when this bold deed
shall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and other
allies of Front-de-Boeuf, will be in motion against us, and it were well
for our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.--Noble Cedric,â€ he
said, turning to the Saxon, â€œthat spoil is divided into two portions; do
thou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy people
who were partakers with us in this adventure.â€

â€œGood yeoman,â€ said Cedric, â€œmy heart is oppressed with sadness. The
noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more--the last sprout of
the sainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never
return!--A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human
breath can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me,
do but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their last
mansion. The Lady Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and must
be escorted by a sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now, have
left this place; and I waited--not to share the booty, for, so help me
God and Saint Withold! as neither I nor any of mine will touch the value
of a liard,--I waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy bold
yeomen, for the life and honour ye have saved.â€

â€œNay, but,â€ said the chief Outlaw, â€œwe did but half the work at
most--take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and
followers.â€

â€œI am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,â€ answered Cedric.

â€œAnd some,â€ said Wamba, â€œhave been wise enough to reward themselves;
they do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear
motley.â€

â€œThey are welcome,â€ said Locksley; â€œour laws bind none but ourselves.â€

â€œBut, thou, my poor knave,â€ said Cedric, turning about and embracing
his Jester, â€œhow shall I reward thee, who feared not to give thy body
to chains and death instead of mine!--All forsook me, when the poor fool
was faithful!â€

A tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke--a mark of
feeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there
was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that
waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.

â€œNay,â€ said the Jester, extricating himself from masterâ€™s caress, â€œif
you pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester must weep
for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?--But, uncle, if you
would indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who
stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.â€

â€œPardon him!â€ exclaimed Cedric; â€œI will both pardon and reward
him.--Kneel down, Gurth.â€--The swineherd was in an instant at his
masterâ€™s feet--â€œTHEOW and ESNE [40] art thou no longer,â€ said Cedric
touching him with a wand; â€œFOLKFREE and SACLESS [41] art thou in town
and from town, in the forest as in the field. A hide of land I give to
thee in my steads of Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee and thine aye
and for ever; and Godâ€™s malison on his head who this gainsays!â€

No longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his
feet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground.
â€œA smith and a file,â€ he cried, â€œto do away the collar from the neck
of a freeman!--Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and
doubly will I fight for you!--There is a free spirit in my breast--I am
a man changed to myself and all around.--Ha, Fangs!â€ he continued,--for
that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump
upon him, to express his sympathy,--â€œknowest thou thy master still?â€

â€œAy,â€ said Wamba, â€œFangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must
needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us
and thyself.â€

â€œI shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,â€ said
Gurth; â€œand were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not let
thee want it.â€

â€œNay,â€ said Wamba, â€œnever think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf
sits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of
battle--And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury--Better a fool at a feast
than a wise man at a fray.â€

The tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared,
surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who
joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her
freedom. She herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut
palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an
unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. Her
lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope
for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past
deliverance--She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that
Athelstane was dead. The former assurance filled her with the most
sincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter,
she might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed
from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been
contradicted by her guardian Cedric.

As Rowena bent her steed towards Locksleyâ€™s seat, that bold yeoman, with
all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of
courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously waving her hand,
and bending so low that her beautiful and loose tresses were for an
instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey, she expressed in
few but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to Locksley and her
other deliverers.--â€œGod bless you, brave men,â€ she concluded, â€œGod and
Our Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly perilling yourselves
in the cause of the oppressed!--If any of you should hunger, remember
Rowena has food--if you should thirst, she has many a butt of wine and
brown ale--and if the Normans drive ye from these walks, Rowena has
forests of her own, where her gallant deliverers may range at full
freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow hath struck down the deer.â€

â€œThanks, gentle lady,â€ said Locksley; â€œthanks from my company and
myself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the
greenwood do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowenaâ€™s deliverance may be
received as an atonement.â€

Again bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a
moment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,
she found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood
under a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast,
and Rowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up,
however, and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame suffused
his handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute; then,
stepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee before
her.

â€œWill the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye--on a captive knight--on a
dishonoured soldier?â€

â€œSir Knight,â€ answered Rowena, â€œin enterprises such as yours, the real
dishonour lies not in failure, but in success.â€

â€œConquest, lady, should soften the heart,â€ answered De Bracy; â€œlet me
but know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an
ill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to
serve her in nobler ways.â€

â€œI forgive you, Sir Knight,â€ said Rowena, â€œas a Christian.â€

â€œThat means,â€ said Wamba, â€œthat she does not forgive him at all.â€

â€œBut I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has
occasioned,â€ continued Rowena.

â€œUnloose your hold on the ladyâ€™s rein,â€ said Cedric, coming up. â€œBy the
bright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to the earth
with my javelin--but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de
Bracy, for thy share in this foul deed.â€

â€œHe threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,â€ said De Bracy; â€œbut when
had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?â€

Then retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.

Cedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the Black
Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to Rotherwood.

â€œI know,â€ he said, â€œthat ye errant knights desire to carry your fortunes
on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but war is
a changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to the
champion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the halls
of Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair the
injuries of fortune, and all he has is his delivererâ€™s--Come, therefore,
to Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.â€

â€œCedric has already made me rich,â€ said the Knight,--â€œhe has taught me
the value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave Saxon, and
that speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from
your halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as
will put even thy generosity to the test.â€

â€œIt is granted ere spoken out,â€ said Cedric, striking his ready hand
into the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,--â€œit is granted already,
were it to affect half my fortune.â€

â€œGage not thy promise so lightly,â€ said the Knight of the Fetterlock;
â€œyet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile, adieu.â€

â€œI have but to say,â€ added the Saxon, â€œthat, during the funeral rites
of the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his
castle of Coningsburgh--They will be open to all who choose to partake
of the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith,
mother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who
laboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from
Norman chains and Norman steel.â€

â€œAy, ay,â€ said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master,
â€œrare feeding there will be--pity that the noble Athelstane cannot
banquet at his own funeral.--But he,â€ continued the Jester, lifting up
his eyes gravely, â€œis supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour to
the cheer.â€

â€œPeace, and move on,â€ said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being
checked by the recollection of Wambaâ€™s recent services. Rowena waved a
graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock--the Saxon bade God speed him,
and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.

They had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the
greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and
took the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of
a neighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or
â€œsoul-scatâ€, which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which
the body of Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly
and slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of
Coningsburgh, to be there deposited in the grave of Hengist, from whom
the deceased derived his long descent. Many of his vassals had assembled
at the news of his death, and followed the bier with all the external
marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws arose, and
paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which they had
so lately rendered to beauty--the slow chant and mournful step of the
priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades as had
fallen in the yesterdayâ€™s array. But such recollections dwell not long
with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere the sound
of the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in
the distribution of their spoil.

â€œValiant knight,â€ said Locksley to the Black Champion, â€œwithout whose
good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed,
will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best
serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?â€

â€œI accept the offer,â€ said the Knight, â€œas frankly as it is given; and I
ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own pleasure.â€

â€œHe is thine already,â€ said Locksley, â€œand well for him! else the
tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his
Free-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around
him.--But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my
father.â€

â€œDe Bracy,â€ said the Knight, â€œthou art free--depart. He whose prisoner
thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But beware of
the future, lest a worse thing befall thee.--Maurice de Bracy, I say
BEWARE!â€

De Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the
yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud
knight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form
to its full height, and exclaimed, â€œPeace, ye yelping curs! who open
upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay--De Bracy
scorns your censure as he would disdain your applause. To your brakes
and caves, ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or
noble is but spoken within a league of your fox-earths.â€

This ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of
arrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw
Chief. Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several
which had been taken in the stables of Front-de-Boeuf stood accoutred
around, and were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon the
saddle, and galloped off through the wood.

When the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the
chief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had
recently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.

â€œNoble knight.â€ he said to him of the Fetterlock, â€œif you disdain not to
grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has once worn,
this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant bearing--and
if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant knight, ye
chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and Tees, wind
three mots [42] upon the horn thus, â€˜Wa-sa-hoa!â€™ and it may well chance
ye shall find helpers and rescue.â€

He then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call
which he described, until the knight had caught the notes.

â€œGramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,â€ said the Knight; â€œand better help
than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost
need.â€ And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood
rang.

â€œWell blown and clearly,â€ said the yeoman; â€œbeshrew me an thou knowest
not as much of woodcraft as of war!--thou hast been a striker of deer in
thy day, I warrant.--Comrades, mark these three mots--it is the call of
the Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens not to
serve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with his
own bowstring.â€

â€œLong live our leader!â€ shouted the yeomen, â€œand long live the Black
Knight of the Fetterlock!--May he soon use our service, to prove how
readily it will be paid.â€

Locksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he
performed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the whole
was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next
allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows
and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for
the souls of such as had left no surviving family. The rest was divided
amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment
of the Chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred, was delivered
with great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. The
Black Knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a state so
lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably
governed, and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice
and judgment of their leader.

When each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the
treasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that
belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the
portion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.

â€œI would,â€ said the leader, â€œwe could hear tidings of our joyous
chaplain--he was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed, or
spoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes
of our successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover
some of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of his
a prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to help
me to deal with him in due sort--I greatly misdoubt the safety of the
bluff priest.â€

â€œI were right sorry for that,â€ said the Knight of the Fetterlock, â€œfor I
stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in his
cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there learn
some tidings of him.â€

While they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the
arrival of him for whom they feared, as they learned from the stentorian
voice of the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly person.

â€œMake room, my merry-men!â€ he exclaimed; â€œroom for your godly father
and his prisoner--Cry welcome once more.--I come, noble leader, like an
eagle with my prey in my clutch.â€--And making his way through the ring,
amidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph, his
huge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which
was fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent
down by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who
shouted aloud, â€œWhere is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or
if it were but a lay?--By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever
out of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!â€

â€œCurtal Priest,â€ said the Captain, â€œthou hast been at a wet mass this
morning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast
thou got here?â€

â€œA captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,â€ replied the
Clerk of Copmanhurst; â€œto my bow and to my halberd, I should rather
say; and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity.
Speak, Jew--have I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?--have I not taught
thee thy â€˜credoâ€™, thy â€˜paterâ€™, and thine â€˜Ave Mariaâ€™?--Did I not spend
the whole night in drinking to thee, and in expounding of mysteries?â€

â€œFor the love of God!â€ ejaculated the poor Jew, â€œwill no one take me out
of the keeping of this mad--I mean this holy man?â€

â€œHowâ€™s this, Jew?â€ said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; â€œdost thou
recant, Jew?--Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thine infidelity,
though thou are not so tender as a suckling pig--I would I had one
to break my fast upon--thou art not too tough to be roasted! Be
conformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. â€˜Ave Mariaâ€™!--â€

â€œNay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,â€ said Locksley; â€œlet us
rather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.â€

â€œBy Saint Dunstan,â€ said the Friar, â€œI found him where I sought for
better ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued
there; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an eveningâ€™s
drought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so much good
liquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and
was coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to
seek when a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong
door--Aha! thought I, here is the choicest juice of all in this secret
crypt; and the knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left
the key in the door--In therefore I went, and found just nought besides
a commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently
rendered himself my prisoner, rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh
myself after the fatigue of the action, with the unbeliever, with one
humming cup of sack, and was proceeding to lead forth my captive,
when, crash after crash, as with wild thunder-dint and levin-fire, down
toppled the masonry of an outer tower, (marry beshrew their hands that
built it not the firmer!) and blocked up the passage. The roar of one
falling tower followed another--I gave up thought of life; and deeming
it a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in
company with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but
I took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down the
partisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And truly,
by the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been sown in good soil;
only that, with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole night,
and being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughts of sack which I
sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is well-nigh
dizzied, I trow.--But I was clean exhausted.--Gilbert and Wibbald know
in what state they found me--quite and clean exhausted.â€

â€œWe can bear witness,â€ said Gilbert; â€œfor when we had cleared away the
ruin, and by Saint Dunstanâ€™s help lighted upon the dungeon stair, we
found the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar
more than half--exhausted, as he calls it.â€

â€œYe be knaves! ye lie!â€ retorted the offended Friar; â€œit was you and
your gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your
morning draught--I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captainâ€™s own
throat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I
have told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.â€

â€œJew,â€ said the Captain, â€œis this true? hast thou renounced thine
unbelief?â€

â€œMay I so find mercy in your eyes,â€ said the Jew, â€œas I know not one
word which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night.
Alas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had
our holy father Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf
listener.â€

â€œThou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.â€ said the Friar; â€œI will
remind thee of but one word of our conference--thou didst promise to
give all thy substance to our holy Order.â€

â€œSo help me the Promise, fair sirs,â€ said Isaac, even more alarmed than
before, â€œas no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged
beggarâ€™d man--I fear me a childless--have ruth on me, and let me go!â€

â€œNay,â€ said the Friar, â€œif thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy
Church, thou must do penance.â€

Accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of
it lustily on the Jewâ€™s shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the
blow, and thereby transferred the Holy Clerkâ€™s resentment to himself.

â€œBy Saint Thomas of Kent,â€ said he, â€œan I buckle to my gear, I will
teach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre thine
iron case there!â€

â€œNay, be not wroth with me,â€ said the Knight; â€œthou knowest I am thy
sworn friend and comrade.â€

â€œI know no such thing,â€ answered the Friar; â€œand defy thee for a
meddling coxcomb!â€

â€œNay, but,â€ said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking
his quondam host, â€œhast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for I say
nothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break
thy vow of fast and vigil?â€

â€œTruly, friend,â€ said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, â€œI will bestow
a buffet on thee.â€

â€œI accept of no such presents,â€ said the Knight; â€œI am content to take
thy cuff [421] as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deep as ever thy prisoner
there exacted in his traffic.â€

â€œI will prove that presently,â€ said the Friar.

â€œHola!â€ cried the Captain, â€œwhat art thou after, mad Friar? brawling
beneath our Trysting-tree?â€

â€œNo brawling,â€ said the Knight, â€œit is but a friendly interchange of
courtesy.--Friar, strike an thou darest--I will stand thy blow, if thou
wilt stand mine.â€

â€œThou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,â€ said the
churchman; â€œbut have at thee--Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath of
Gath in his brazen helmet.â€

The Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full
strength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled an
ox. But his adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered by
all the yeomen around; for the Clerkâ€™s cuff was proverbial amongst them,
and there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the occasion to
know its vigour.

â€œNow, Priest,â€ said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, â€œif I had
vantage on my head, I will have none on my hand--stand fast as a true
man.â€

â€œâ€˜Genam meam dedi vapulatoriâ€™--I have given my cheek to the smiter,â€
 said the Priest; â€œan thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow, I will
freely bestow on thee the Jewâ€™s ransom.â€

So spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But
who may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such
strength and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon
the plain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. But he arose
neither angry nor crestfallen.

â€œBrother,â€ said he to the Knight, â€œthou shouldst have used thy strength
with more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst
broken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops.
Nevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will
exchange no more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter. End
now all unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard will
not change his spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.â€

â€œThe Priest,â€ said Clement, â€œis not half so confident of the Jewâ€™s
conversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.â€

â€œGo to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?--what, is there no
respect?--all masters and no men?--I tell thee, fellow, I was somewhat
totty when I received the good knightâ€™s blow, or I had kept my ground
under it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can give as
well as take.â€

â€œPeace all!â€ said the Captain. â€œAnd thou, Jew, think of thy ransom;
thou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in all
Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy presence
among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a prisoner of
another cast.â€

â€œWere many of Front-de-Boeufâ€™s men taken?â€ demanded the Black Knight.

â€œNone of note enough to be put to ransom,â€ answered the Captain; â€œa
set of hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a new
master--enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them
were not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty--a
jolly monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear
and wearing apparel.--Here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a
pyet.â€ And, between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of
the outlaw Chief, our old friend, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.




CHAPTER XXXIII

     ---Flower of warriors,
     How isâ€™t with Titus Lartius?
     MARCIUS.--As with a man busied about decrees,
     Condemning some to death and some to exile,
     Ransoming him or pitying, threatening the other.
     --Coriolanus


The captive Abbotâ€™s features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture
of offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.

â€œWhy, how now, my masters?â€ said he, with a voice in which all three
emotions were blended. â€œWhat order is this among ye? Be ye Turks
or Christians, that handle a churchman?--Know ye what it is, â€˜manus
imponere in servos Dominiâ€™? Ye have plundered my mails--torn my cope
of curious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!--Another in my
place would have been at his â€˜excommunicabo vosâ€™; but I am placible,
and if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore
my mails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in
masses at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no
venison until next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of
this mad frolic.â€

â€œHoly Father,â€ said the chief Outlaw, â€œit grieves me to think that you
have met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your
fatherly reprehension.â€

â€œUsage!â€ echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan
leader; â€œit were usage fit for no hound of good race--much less for a
Christian--far less for a priest--and least of all for the Prior of
the holy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken minstrel,
called Allan-a-Dale--â€˜nebulo quidamâ€™--who has menaced me with corporal
punishment--nay, with death itself, an I pay not down four hundred
crowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already robbed
me of--gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value; besides what
is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my pouncer-box and
silver crisping-tongs.â€

â€œIt is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your
reverend bearing,â€ replied the Captain.

â€œIt is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,â€ said the Prior; â€œhe
swore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up on
the highest tree in the greenwood.â€

â€œDid he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had
better comply with his demands--for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to
abide by his word when he has so pledged it.â€ [43]

â€œYou do but jest with me,â€ said the astounded Prior, with a forced
laugh; â€œand I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when
the mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the
morning.â€

â€œAnd I am as grave as a father confessor,â€ replied the Outlaw; â€œyou must
pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be called to
a new election; for your place will know you no more.â€

â€œAre ye Christians,â€ said the Prior, â€œand hold this language to a
churchman?â€

â€œChristians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,â€
 answered the Outlaw. â€œLet our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound to
this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.â€

The Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friarâ€™s frock over his
green cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning
he had acquired by rote in former days, â€œHoly father,â€ said he, â€œâ€˜Deus
faciat salvam benignitatem vestramâ€™--You are welcome to the greenwood.â€

â€œWhat profane mummery is this?â€ said the Prior. â€œFriend, if thou beâ€™st
indeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I may escape
from these menâ€™s hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a
morris-dancer.â€

â€œTruly, reverend father,â€ said the Friar, â€œI know but one mode in which
thou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrewâ€™s day with us, we are taking our
tithes.â€

â€œBut not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?â€ said the Prior.

â€œOf church and lay,â€ said the Friar; â€œand therefore, Sir Prior â€˜facite
vobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatisâ€™--make yourselves friends of the
Mammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve your
turn.â€

â€œI love a jolly woodsman at heart,â€ said the Prior, softening his tone;
â€œcome, ye must not deal too hard with me--I can well of woodcraft,
and can wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings
again--Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.â€

â€œGive him a horn,â€ said the Outlaw; â€œwe will prove the skill he boasts
of.â€

The Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.

â€œSir Prior,â€ he said, â€œthou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom
thee--we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knightâ€™s shield hath it,
to set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee--thou art
one of those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the
ancient English bugle notes.--Prior, that last flourish on the recheat
hath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old manly
blasts of venerie.â€

â€œWell, friend,â€ said the Abbot, peevishly, â€œthou art ill to please with
thy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my
ransom. At a word--since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the
devil--what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without
having fifty men at my back?â€

â€œWere it not well,â€ said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the
Captain, â€œthat the Prior should name the Jewâ€™s ransom, and the Jew name
the Priorâ€™s?â€

â€œThou art a mad knave,â€ said the Captain, â€œbut thy plan
transcends!--Here, Jew, step forth--Look at that holy Father Aymer,
Prior of the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we
should hold him?--Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrant
thee.â€

â€œO, assuredly,â€ said Isaac. â€œI have trafficked with the good fathers,
and bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much
wool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and
drink the sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx. Ah,
if an outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings by
the year and by the month, I would pay much gold and silver to redeem my
captivity.â€

â€œHound of a Jew!â€ exclaimed the Prior, â€œno one knows better than thy own
cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the finishing of
our chancel--â€

â€œAnd for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due
allowance of Gascon wine,â€ interrupted the Jew; â€œbut that--that is small
matters.â€

â€œHear the infidel dog!â€ said the churchman; â€œhe jangles as if our holy
community did come under debts for the wines we have a license to
drink, â€˜propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendumâ€™. The circumcised
villain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men listen and rebuke
him not!â€

â€œAll this helps nothing,â€ said the leader.--â€œIsaac, pronounce what he
may pay, without flaying both hide and hair.â€

â€œAn six hundred crowns,â€ said Isaac, â€œthe good Prior might well pay to
your honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.â€

â€œSix hundred crowns,â€ said the leader, gravely; â€œI am contented--thou
hast well spoken, Isaac--six hundred crowns.--It is a sentence, Sir
Prior.â€

â€œA sentence!--a sentence!â€ exclaimed the band; â€œSolomon had not done it
better.â€

â€œThou hearest thy doom, Prior,â€ said the leader.

â€œYe are mad, my masters,â€ said the Prior; â€œwhere am I to find such a
sum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx,
I shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that purpose
that I go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows [44] my two
priests.â€

â€œThat will be but blind trust,â€ said the Outlaw; â€œwe will retain thee,
Prior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a cup of
wine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft,
thou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.â€

â€œOr, if so please you,â€ said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the
outlaws, â€œI can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of certain
monies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will
grant me a quittance.â€

â€œHe shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,â€ said the Captain;
â€œand thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as well as
for thyself.â€

â€œFor myself! ah, courageous sirs,â€ said the Jew, â€œI am a broken and
impoverished man; a beggarâ€™s staff must be my portion through life,
supposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.â€

â€œThe Prior shall judge of that matter,â€ replied the Captain.--â€œHow say
you, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?â€

â€œCan he afford a ransom?â€ answered the Prior â€œIs he not Isaac of York,
rich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who
were led into Assyrian bondage?--I have seen but little of him myself,
but our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report
says that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame
in any Christian land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that
such gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the
state, and even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and
extortions.â€

â€œHold, father,â€ said the Jew, â€œmitigate and assuage your choler. I pray
of your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no one. But
when churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come
knocking to Isaacâ€™s door, they borrow not his shekels with these uncivil
terms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this matter,
and our day shall be truly kept, so God saâ€™ me?--and Kind Isaac, if ever
you served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when the day
comes, and I ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and The curse
of Egypt on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and uncivil
populace against poor strangers!â€

â€œPrior,â€ said the Captain, â€œJew though he be, he hath in this spoken
well. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without
farther rude terms.â€

â€œNone but â€˜latro famosusâ€™--the interpretation whereof,â€ said the Prior,
â€œwill I give at some other time and tide--would place a Christian
prelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye require
me to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openly that ye will
wrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns.â€

â€œA sentence!--a sentence!â€ exclaimed the chief Outlaw.

â€œA sentence!--a sentence!â€ shouted his assessors; â€œthe Christian has
shown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than the Jew.â€

â€œThe God of my fathers help me!â€ said the Jew; â€œwill ye bear to the
ground an impoverished creature?--I am this day childless, and will ye
deprive me of the means of livelihood?â€

â€œThou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,â€
 said Aymer.

â€œAlas! my lord,â€ said Isaac, â€œyour law permits you not to know how the
child of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart--O Rebecca!
laughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a zecchin,
and each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give to know
whether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!â€

â€œWas not thy daughter dark-haired?â€ said one of the outlaws; â€œand wore
she not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?â€

â€œShe did!--she did!â€ said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as
formerly with fear. â€œThe blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canst thou tell
me aught of her safety?â€

â€œIt was she, then,â€ said the yeoman, â€œwho was carried off by the proud
Templar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn my
bow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the
damsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.â€

â€œOh!â€ answered the Jew, â€œI would to God thou hadst shot, though the
arrow had pierced her bosom!--Better the tomb of her fathers than the
dishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod!
Ichabod! the glory hath departed from my house!â€

â€œFriends,â€ said the Chief, looking round, â€œthe old man is but a Jew,
natheless his grief touches me.--Deal uprightly with us, Isaac--will
paying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether
penniless?â€

Isaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by
dint of inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection,
grew pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small
surplus.

â€œWell--go to--what though there be,â€ said the Outlaw, â€œwe will not
reckon with thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as well hope
to redeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as
to shoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.--We will take thee at the
same ransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower,
which hundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon
this worshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of
rating a Jew merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt
have six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughterâ€™s ransom.
Templars love the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle
of black eyes.--Hasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De
Bois-Guilbert, ere worse comes of it. Thou wilt find him, as our scouts
have brought notice, at the next Preceptory house of his Order.--Said I
well, my merry mates?â€

The yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leaderâ€™s
opinion; and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by
learning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw
himself at the feet of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard
against his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The
Captain drew himself back, and extricated himself from the Jewâ€™s grasp,
not without some marks of contempt.

â€œNay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no
such Eastern prostrations--Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like
me.â€

â€œAy, Jew,â€ said Prior Aymer; â€œkneel to God, as represented in the
servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due
gifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for
thyself and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she is of
fair and comely countenance,--I beheld her in the lists of Ashby. Also
Brian de Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much--bethink thee how
thou mayst deserve my good word with him.â€

â€œAlas! alas!â€ said the Jew, â€œon every hand the spoilers arise against
me--I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of
Egypt.â€

â€œAnd what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?â€ answered
the Prior; â€œfor what saith holy writ, â€˜verbum Domini projecerunt, et
sapientia est nulla in eisâ€™--they have cast forth the word of the
Lord, and there is no wisdom in them; â€˜propterea dabo mulieres eorum
exterisâ€™--I will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar,
as in the present matter; â€˜et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienisâ€™,
and their treasures to others--as in the present case to these honest
gentlemen.â€

Isaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into
his state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led
him aside.

â€œAdvise thee well, Isaac,â€ said Locksley, â€œwhat thou wilt do in this
matter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is
vain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his
profusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am
blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac,
with the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags--What!
know I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into
the vaulted chamber under thy garden at York?â€ The Jew grew as pale as
death--â€œBut fear nothing from me,â€ continued the yeoman, â€œfor we are
of old acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair
daughter Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in
thy house till his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him
recovered, and with a piece of money?--Usurer as thou art, thou didst
never place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it
has this day saved thee five hundred crowns.â€

â€œAnd thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?â€ said Isaac; â€œI
thought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.â€

â€œI am Bend-the-Bow,â€ said the Captain, â€œand Locksley, and have a good
name besides all these.â€

â€œBut thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same
vaulted apartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some
merchandises which I will gladly part with to you--one hundred yards
of Lincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of
Spanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough, round,
and sound--these will I send thee for thy good-will, honest Diccon, an
thou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.â€

â€œSilent as a dormouse,â€ said the Outlaw; â€œand never trust me but I am
grieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it--The Templars lances are
too strong for my archery in the open field--they would scatter us like
dust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off, something
might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come,
shall I treat for thee with the Prior?â€

â€œIn Godâ€™s name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my
bosom!â€

â€œDo not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,â€ said the
Outlaw, â€œand I will deal with him in thy behalf.â€

He then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as
his shadow.

â€œPrior Aymer,â€ said the Captain, â€œcome apart with me under this tree.
Men say thou dost love wine, and a ladyâ€™s smile, better than beseems thy
Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard, too,
thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may well
be that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest not a
purse of gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love oppression or
cruelty.--Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the means of pleasure
and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of silver, if thy
intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to procure the
freedom of his daughter.â€

â€œIn safety and honour, as when taken from me,â€ said the Jew, â€œotherwise
it is no bargain.â€

â€œPeace, Isaac,â€ said the Outlaw, â€œor I give up thine interest.--What say
you to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?â€

â€œThe matter,â€ quoth the Prior, â€œis of a mixed condition; for, if I do a
good deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage
of a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the Israelite
will advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the building
of our dortour, [45] I will take it on my conscience to aid him in the
matter of his daughter.â€

â€œFor a score of marks to the dortour,â€ said the Outlaw,--â€œBe still, I
say, Isaac!--or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, we will
not stand with you.â€

â€œNay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bowâ€--said Isaac, endeavouring to
interpose.

â€œGood Jew--good beast--good earthworm!â€ said the yeoman, losing
patience; â€œan thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance
with thy daughterâ€™s life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of
every maravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!â€

Isaac shrunk together, and was silent.

â€œAnd what pledge am I to have for all this?â€ said the Prior.

â€œWhen Isaac returns successful through your mediation,â€ said the Outlaw,
â€œI swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the money in good
silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he had better
have paid twenty such sums.â€

â€œWell then, Jew,â€ said Aymer, â€œsince I must needs meddle in this matter,
let me have the use of thy writing-tablets--though, hold--rather than
use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I find
one?â€

â€œIf your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jewâ€™s tablets, for
the pen I can find a remedy,â€ said the yeoman; and, bending his bow, he
aimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the
advanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way
to the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came fluttering
down, transfixed with the arrow.

â€œThere, Prior,â€ said the Captain, â€œare quills enow to supply all the
monks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to
writing chronicles.â€

The Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian
de Bois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered
them to the Jew, saying, â€œThis will be thy safe-conduct to the
Preceptory of Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to accomplish
the delivery of thy daughter, if it be well backed with proffers of
advantage and commodity at thine own hand; for, trust me well, the
good Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do nought for
nought.â€

â€œWell, Prior,â€ said the Outlaw, â€œI will detain thee no longer here than
to give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy
ransom is fixed--I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that
ye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint
Mary refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang
ten years the sooner!â€

With a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to
Bois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of York
of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal of his
ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for that
sum.

â€œAnd now,â€ said Prior Aymer, â€œI will pray you of restitution of my mules
and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending upon
me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of which
I have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as a true
prisoner.â€

â€œTouching your brethren, Sir Prior,â€ said Locksley, â€œthey shall have
present freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses
and mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may
enable you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means
of journeying.--But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else,
you must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will
not yield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the
vanities of this life, the strong temptation to break the rule of his
foundation, by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.â€

â€œThink what you do, my masters,â€ said the Prior, â€œere you put your hand
on the Churchâ€™s patrimony--These things are â€˜inter res sacrasâ€™, and
I wot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical
hands.â€

â€œI will take care of that, reverend Prior,â€ said the Hermit of
Copmanhurst; â€œfor I will wear them myself.â€

â€œFriend, or brother,â€ said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his
doubts, â€œif thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to look
how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast taken in
this dayâ€™s work.â€

â€œFriend Prior,â€ returned the Hermit, â€œyou are to know that I belong to
a little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for the
Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and all the
convent.â€

â€œThou art utterly irregular,â€ said the Prior; â€œone of those disorderly
men, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause, profane
the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take counsel at
their hands; â€˜lapides pro pane condonantes iisâ€™, giving them stones
instead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.â€

â€œNay,â€ said the Friar, â€œan my brain-pan could have been broken by Latin,
it had not held so long together.--I say, that easing a world of such
misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks, is a
lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.â€

â€œThou beâ€™st a hedge-priest,â€ [46] said the Prior, in great wrath,
â€œâ€˜excommunicabo vosâ€™.â€

â€œThou beâ€™st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,â€ said the
Friar, equally indignant; â€œI will pouch up no such affront before my
parishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I
be a reverend brother to thee. â€˜Ossa ejus perfringamâ€™, I will break your
bones, as the Vulgate hath it.â€

â€œHola!â€ cried the Captain, â€œcome the reverend brethren to such
terms?--Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.--Prior, an thou hast not
made thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.--Hermit,
let the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.â€

The yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their
voices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered
the more fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior
at length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was
compromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the
Outlawâ€™s chaplain, and being joined by his attendants, rode off with
considerably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so
far as worldly matters were concerned, than he had exhibited before this
rencounter.

It remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom
which he was to pay on the Priorâ€™s account, as well as upon his own. He
gave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his
tribe at York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand
crowns, and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.

â€œMy brother Sheva,â€ he said, groaning deeply, â€œhath the key of my
warehouses.â€

â€œAnd of the vaulted chamber,â€ whispered Locksley.

â€œNo, no--may Heaven forefend!â€ said Isaac; â€œevil is the hour that let
any one whomsoever into that secret!â€

â€œIt is safe with me,â€ said the Outlaw, â€œso be that this thy scroll
produce the sum therein nominated and set down.--But what now, Isaac?
art dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy
daughterâ€™s peril out of thy mind?â€

The Jew started to his feet--â€œNo, Diccon, no--I will presently set
forth.--Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and will
not call evil.â€

Yet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting
advice:--â€œBe liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse for
thy daughterâ€™s safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in
her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured
molten down thy throat.â€

Isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey,
accompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the
same time his guards, through the wood.

The Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various
proceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he
avoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil
policy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and
influence of the laws.

â€œGood fruit, Sir Knight,â€ said the yeoman, â€œwill sometimes grow on a
sorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and
unmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there
are, doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise its license with some
moderation, and some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to
follow such a trade at all.â€

â€œAnd to one of those,â€ said the Knight, â€œI am now, I presume, speaking?â€

â€œSir Knight,â€ said the Outlaw, â€œwe have each our secret. You are welcome
to form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures touching you,
though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are shot at. But as
I do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not offended that I
preserve my own.â€

â€œI crave pardon, brave Outlaw,â€ said the Knight, â€œyour reproof is just.
But it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on either
side.--Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?â€

â€œThere is my hand upon it,â€ said Locksley; â€œand I will call it the hand
of a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.â€

â€œAnd there is mine in return,â€ said the Knight, â€œand I hold it honoured
by being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the unlimited
power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which he
performs, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well, gallant
Outlaw!â€ Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the Fetterlock,
mounting upon his strong war-horse, rode off through the forest.




CHAPTER XXXIV


     KING JOHN.--Iâ€™ll tell thee what, my friend,
     He is a very serpent in my way;
     And wheresoeâ€™er this foot of mine doth tread,
     He lies before me.--Dost thou understand me?
     --King John

There was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John
had invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he
hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brotherâ€™s throne.
Waldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among
them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in
making an open declaration of their purpose. But their enterprise was
delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy.
The stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of Front-de-Boeuf; the
buoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy; the sagacity, martial
experience, and renowned valour of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, were
important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in
secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither John nor his
adviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the Jew also seemed to have
vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the
subsidy for which Prince John had contracted with that Israelite and his
brethren. This deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency
so critical.

It was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused
report began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and
Bois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-Boeuf, had been taken or
slain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he
feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance,
for the purpose of committing an assault on the Saxon Cedric and his
attendants. At another time the Prince would have treated this deed of
violence as a good jest; but now, that it interfered with and impeded
his own plans, he exclaimed against the perpetrators, and spoke of
the broken laws, and the infringement of public order and of private
property, in a tone which might have become King Alfred.

â€œThe unprincipled marauders,â€ he said--â€œwere I ever to become monarch of
England, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their
own castles.â€

â€œBut to become monarch of England,â€ said his Ahithophel coolly, â€œit is
necessary not only that your Grace should endure the transgressions
of these unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your
protection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in
the habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl
Saxons should have realized your Graceâ€™s vision, of converting feudal
drawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one to
whom such an imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it will
be dangerous to stir without Front-de-Boeuf, De Bracy, and the Templar;
and yet we have gone too far to recede with safety.â€

Prince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to
stride up and down the apartment.

â€œThe villains,â€ he said, â€œthe base treacherous villains, to desert me at
this pinch!â€

â€œNay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,â€ said Waldemar, â€œwho
must be toying with follies when such business was in hand.â€

â€œWhat is to be done?â€ said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar.

â€œI know nothing which can be done,â€ answered his counsellor, â€œsave that
which I have already taken order for.--I came not to bewail this evil
chance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.â€

â€œThou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,â€ said the Prince; â€œand when
I have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John will be
renowned in our annals.--What hast thou commanded?â€

â€œI have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracyâ€™s lieutenant, to cause his
trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently
forth towards the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, to do what yet may be done
for the succour of our friends.â€

Prince Johnâ€™s face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has
undergone what it conceives to be an insult. â€œBy the face of God!â€
 he said, â€œWaldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over
malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in
a town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.â€

â€œI crave your Graceâ€™s pardon,â€ said Fitzurse, internally cursing the
idle vanity of his patron; â€œbut when time pressed, and even the loss of
minutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon
me, in a matter of such importance to your Graceâ€™s interest.â€

â€œThou art pardoned, Fitzurse,â€ said the prince, gravely; â€œthy purpose
hath atoned for thy hasty rashness.--But whom have we here?--De Bracy
himself, by the rood!--and in strange guise doth he come before us.â€

It was indeed De Bracy--â€œbloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.â€
 His armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken,
defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay
and dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it
on the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told
his news.

â€œDe Bracy,â€ said Prince John, â€œwhat means this?--Speak, I charge
thee!--Are the Saxons in rebellion?â€

â€œSpeak, De Bracy,â€ said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his
master, â€œthou wert wont to be a man--Where is the Templar?--where
Front-de-Boeuf?â€

â€œThe Templar is fled,â€ said De Bracy; â€œFront-de-Boeuf you will never
see more. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own
castle and I alone am escaped to tell you.â€

â€œCold news,â€ said Waldemar, â€œto us, though you speak of fire and
conflagration.â€

â€œThe worst news is not yet said,â€ answered De Bracy; and, coming up
to Prince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone--â€œRichard is in
England--I have seen and spoken with him.â€

Prince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken
bench to support himself--much like to a man who receives an arrow in
his bosom.

â€œThou ravest, De Bracy,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œit cannot be.â€

â€œIt is as true as truth itself,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI was his prisoner, and
spoke with him.â€

â€œWith Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?â€ continued Fitzurse.

â€œWith Richard Plantagenet,â€ replied De Bracy, â€œwith Richard
Coeur-de-Lion--with Richard of England.â€

â€œAnd thou wert his prisoner?â€ said Waldemar; â€œhe is then at the head of
a power?â€

â€œNo--only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his person
is unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He joined
them only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.â€

â€œAy,â€ said Fitzurse, â€œsuch is indeed the fashion of Richard--a true
knight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting the
prowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while
the weighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is
endangered.--What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?â€

â€œI?--I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused
them--I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for
Flanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always find
employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay
down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which God
sends us?â€

â€œI am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,â€ answered Waldemar.

â€œGive her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank,
with the help of lance and stirrup,â€ said De Bracy.

â€œNot so,â€ answered Fitzurse; â€œI will take sanctuary in this church of
Saint Peter--the Archbishop is my sworn brother.â€

During this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the
stupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence,
and had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his
followers. â€œThey fall off from me,â€ he said to himself, â€œthey hold no
more by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on
it!--Hell and fiends! can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted
by these cravens?â€--He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical
passion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on
their conversation.

â€œHa, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Ladyâ€™s brow, I held ye
sage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour,
pleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might
be won by one bold cast!â€

â€œI understand you not,â€ said De Bracy. â€œAs soon as Richardâ€™s return is
blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over
with us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France or take
the protection of the Queen Mother.â€

â€œI seek no safety for myself,â€ said Prince John, haughtily; â€œthat I
could secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De Bracy,
and you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should not
greatly delight to see your heads blackening on Cliffordâ€™s gate yonder.
Thinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not suffer thee
to be taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make his
peace with King Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert
Estoteville lies betwixt thee and Hull with all his forces, and that the
Earl of Essex is gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear these
levies even before Richardâ€™s return, trowest thou there is any doubt
now which party their leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville alone has
strength enough to drive all thy Free Lances into the Humber.â€--Waldemar
Fitzurse and De Bracy looked in each otherâ€™s faces with blank
dismay.--â€œThere is but one road to safety,â€ continued the Prince, and
his brow grew black as midnight; â€œthis object of our terror journeys
alone--He must be met withal.â€

â€œNot by me,â€ said De Bracy, hastily; â€œI was his prisoner, and he took me
to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.â€

â€œWho spoke of harming him?â€ said Prince John, with a hardened laugh;
â€œthe knave will say next that I meant he should slay him!--No--a prison
were better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?--Things
will be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise--It was
founded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany--Our
uncle Robert lived and died in the castle of Cardiffe.â€

â€œAy, but,â€ said Waldemar, â€œyour sire Henry sate more firm in his seat
than your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by the
sexton--no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.â€

â€œPrison or tomb,â€ said De Bracy, â€œI wash my hands of the whole matter.â€

â€œVillain!â€ said Prince John, â€œthou wouldst not bewray our counsel?â€

â€œCounsel was never bewrayed by me,â€ said De Bracy, haughtily, â€œnor must
the name of villain be coupled with mine!â€

â€œPeace, Sir Knight!â€ said Waldemar; â€œand you, good my lord, forgive the
scruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove them.â€

â€œThat passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,â€ replied the Knight.

â€œWhy, good Sir Maurice,â€ rejoined the wily politician, â€œstart not aside
like a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of your
terror.--This Richard--but a day since, and it would have been thy
dearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle--a
hundred times I have heard thee wish it.â€

â€œAy,â€ said De Bracy, â€œbut that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and
in the ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of
assaulting him alone, and in a forest.â€

â€œThou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,â€ said Waldemar.
â€œWas it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won renown? or
was it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and
unknown forests?â€

â€œAy, but I promise you,â€ said De Bracy, â€œthat neither Tristram nor
Lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard Plantagenet,
and I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.â€

â€œThou art mad, De Bracy--what is it we propose to thee, a hired and
retained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for
Prince Johnâ€™s service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou
scruplest, though thy patronâ€™s fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine
own, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!â€

â€œI tell you,â€ said De Bracy, sullenly, â€œthat he gave me my life. True,
he sent me from his presence, and refused my homage--so far I owe him
neither favour nor allegiance--but I will not lift hand against him.â€

â€œIt needs not--send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.â€

â€œYe have sufficient ruffians of your own,â€ said De Bracy; â€œnot one of
mine shall budge on such an errand.â€

â€œArt thou so obstinate, De Bracy?â€ said Prince John; â€œand wilt thou
forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?â€

â€œI mean it not,â€ said De Bracy; â€œI will abide by you in aught that
becomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway
practice comes not within my vow.â€

â€œCome hither, Waldemar,â€ said Prince John. â€œAn unhappy prince am I. My
father, King Henry, had faithful servants--He had but to say that he was
plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint
though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.--Tracy, Morville,
Brito [47] loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are
extinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen
off from his fatherâ€™s fidelity and courage.â€

â€œHe has fallen off from neither,â€ said Waldemar Fitzurse; â€œand since
it may not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this perilous
enterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a
zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far short
of what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole calendar
of saints, than put spear in rest against Coeur-de-Lion.--De Bracy, to
thee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard
Prince Johnâ€™s person. If you receive such news as I trust to send you,
our enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.--Page,â€ he said,
â€œhie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in readiness; and
bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three Spears of Spyinghow,
come to me instantly; and let the scout-master, Hugh Bardon, attend me
also.--Adieu, my Prince, till better times.â€ Thus speaking, he left the
apartment. â€œHe goes to make my brother prisoner,â€ said Prince John to De
Bracy, â€œwith as little touch of compunction, as if it but concerned the
liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will observe our orders, and use
our dear Richardâ€™s person with all due respect.â€

De Bracy only answered by a smile.

â€œBy the light of Our Ladyâ€™s brow,â€ said Prince John, â€œour orders to
him were most precise--though it may be you heard them not, as we stood
together in the oriel window--Most clear and positive was our charge
that Richardâ€™s safety should be cared for, and woe to Waldemarâ€™s head if
he transgress it!â€

â€œI had better pass to his lodgings,â€ said De Bracy, â€œand make him fully
aware of your Graceâ€™s pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may
not perchance have reached that of Waldemar.â€

â€œNay, nay,â€ said Prince John, impatiently, â€œI promise thee he heard me;
and, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come hither;
let me lean on thy shoulder.â€

They walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and Prince
John, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say,
â€œWhat thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?--He trusts
to be our Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office so high
to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so
readily undertaking this enterprise against Richard. Thou dost think,
I warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly
declining this unpleasing task--But no, Maurice! I rather honour thee
for thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary to be done,
the perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and there may be
refusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our estimation those
who deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate brother forms no
such good title to the high office of Chancellor, as thy chivalrous and
courageous denial establishes in thee to the truncheon of High Marshal.
Think of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy charge.â€

â€œFickle tyrant!â€ muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the
Prince; â€œevil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor, indeed!--He
who hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I
trow. But High Marshal of England! that,â€ he said, extending his arm, as
if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the
antechamber, â€œthat is indeed a prize worth playing for!â€

De Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an
attendant.

â€œBid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall
have spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.â€

The scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John
traversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.

â€œBardon,â€ said he, â€œwhat did Waldemar desire of thee?â€

â€œTwo resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and
skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.â€

â€œAnd thou hast fitted him?â€

â€œLet your grace never trust me else,â€ answered the master of the spies.
â€œOne is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and Teviotdale
thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer. The other
is Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in merry
Sherwood; he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood, betwixt
this and Richmond.â€

â€œâ€˜Tis well,â€ said the Prince.--â€œGoes Waldemar forth with them?â€

â€œInstantly,â€ said Bardon.

â€œWith what attendance?â€ asked John, carelessly.

â€œBroad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his
cruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that
belonged to Ralph Middletonâ€™s gang--they are called the Spears of
Spyinghow.â€

â€œâ€˜Tis well,â€ said Prince John; then added, after a momentâ€™s pause,
â€œBardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on Maurice
De Bracy--so that he shall not observe it, however--And let us know
of his motions from time to time--with whom he converses, what he
proposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.â€

Hugh Bardon bowed, and retired.

â€œIf Maurice betrays me,â€ said Prince John--â€œif he betrays me, as his
bearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard thundering
at the gates of York.â€




CHAPTER XXXV

     Arouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,
     Strive with the half-starved lion for his prey;
     Lesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering fire
     Of wild Fanaticism.
     --Anonymus

Our tale now returns to Isaac of York.--Mounted upon a mule, the gift of
the Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the
Jew had set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of
negotiating his daughterâ€™s redemption. The Preceptory was but a dayâ€™s
journey from the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had
hoped to reach it before nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his
guides at the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of
silver, he began to press on with such speed as his weariness permitted
him to exert. But his strength failed him totally ere he had reached
within four miles of the Temple-Court; racking pains shot along his back
and through his limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt at heart
being now augmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered altogether
incapable of proceeding farther than a small market-town, were dwelt
a Jewish Rabbi of his tribe, eminent in the medical profession, and
to whom Isaac was well known. Nathan Ben Israel received his suffering
countryman with that kindness which the law prescribed, and which the
Jews practised to each other. He insisted on his betaking himself to
repose, and used such remedies as were then in most repute to check the
progress of the fever, which terror, fatigue, ill usage, and sorrow, had
brought upon the poor old Jew.

On the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey,
Nathan remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host and as his
physician. It might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied,
that more than life and death depended upon his going that morning to
Templestowe.

â€œTo Templestowe!â€ said his host with surprise again felt his pulse,
and then muttered to himself, â€œHis fever is abated, yet seems his mind
somewhat alienated and disturbed.â€

â€œAnd why not to Templestowe?â€ answered his patient. â€œI grant thee,
Nathan, that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised Children of
the Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest
that pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these
bloodthirsty Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of
the Templars, as well as the Commanderies of the Knights Hospitallers,
as they are called.â€ [48]

â€œI know it well,â€ said Nathan; â€œbut wottest thou that Lucas de
Beaumanoir, the chief of their Order, and whom they term Grand Master,
is now himself at Templestowe?â€

â€œI know it not,â€ said Isaac; â€œour last letters from our brethren at
Paris advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for aid
against the Sultan Saladine.â€

â€œHe hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,â€ said Ben
Israel; â€œand he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm to
correct and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against those
who have departed from the vow which they have made, and great is the
fear of those sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?â€

â€œIt is well known unto me,â€ said Isaac; â€œthe Gentiles deliver this Lucas
Beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the Nazarene
law; and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of the
Saracens, and a cruel tyrant to the Children of the Promise.â€

â€œAnd truly have they termed him,â€ said Nathan the physician. â€œOther
Templars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure, or
bribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different
stamp--hating sensuality, despising treasure, and pressing forward to
that which they call the crown of martyrdom--The God of Jacob speedily
send it unto him, and unto them all! Specially hath this proud man
extended his glove over the children of Judah, as holy David over Edom,
holding the murder of a Jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as the
death of a Saracen. Impious and false things has he said even of the
virtues of our medicines, as if they were the devices of Satan--The Lord
rebuke him!â€

â€œNevertheless,â€ said Isaac, â€œI must present myself at Templestowe,
though he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times
heated.â€

He then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The Rabbi
listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of
his people, rending his clothes, and saying, â€œAh, my daughter!--ah, my
daughter!--Alas! for the beauty of Zion!--Alas! for the captivity of
Israel!â€

â€œThou seest,â€ said Isaac, â€œhow it stands with me, and that I may not
tarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir, being the
chief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which
he doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter
Rebecca.â€

â€œGo thou,â€ said Nathan Ben Israel, â€œand be wise, for wisdom availed
Daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well
with thee, even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee
from the presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scorn to our
people is his morning and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst
speak with Bois-Guilbert in private, thou shalt the better prevail with
him; for men say that these accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in
the Preceptory--May their counsels be confounded and brought to shame!
But do thou, brother, return to me as if it were to the house of thy
father, and bring me word how it has sped with thee; and well do I hope
thou wilt bring with thee Rebecca, even the scholar of the wise Miriam,
whose cures the Gentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by
necromancy.â€

Isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hourâ€™s riding
brought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.

This establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and
pastures, which the devotion of the former Preceptor had bestowed upon
their Order. It was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected
by these knights, and which the disordered state of England rendered
peculiarly necessary. Two halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the
drawbridge, and others, in the same sad livery, glided to and fro upon
the walls with a funereal pace, resembling spectres more than soldiers.
The inferior officers of the Order were thus dressed, ever since their
use of white garments, similar to those of the knights and esquires, had
given rise to a combination of certain false brethren in the mountains
of Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great dishonour
on the Order. A knight was now and then seen to cross the court in his
long white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and his arms folded.
They passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn,
and mute greeting; for such was the rule of their Order, quoting
thereupon the holy texts, â€œIn many words thou shalt not avoid sin,â€ and
â€œLife and death are in the power of the tongue.â€ In a word, the
stern ascetic rigour of the Temple discipline, which had been so long
exchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence, seemed at once to have
revived at Templestowe under the severe eye of Lucas Beaumanoir.

Isaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the
manner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to his
unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less dangerous
than their unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion would be
the object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his wealth
would have exposed him in the other to the extortions of unrelenting
oppression.

Meantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the
Preceptory, included within the precincts of its exterior fortification,
and held sad and confidential communication with a brother of his Order,
who had come in his company from Palestine.

The Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testified by his long
grey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of which,
however, years had been unable to quench the fire. A formidable warrior,
his thin and severe features retained the soldierâ€™s fierceness of
expression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the emaciation
of abstinence, and the spiritual pride of the self-satisfied devotee.
Yet with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed somewhat
striking and noble, arising, doubtless, from the great part which his
high office called upon him to act among monarchs and princes, and
from the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the valiant and
high-born knights, who were united by the rules of the Order. His
stature was tall, and his gait, undepressed by age and toil, was
erect and stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe regularity,
according to the rule of Saint Bernard himself, being composed of what
was then called Burrel cloth, exactly fitted to the size of the wearer,
and bearing on the left shoulder the octangular cross peculiar to the
Order, formed of red cloth. No vair or ermine decked this garment; but
in respect of his age, the Grand Master, as permitted by the rules, wore
his doublet lined and trimmed with the softest lambskin, dressed with
the wool outwards, which was the nearest approach he could regularly
make to the use of fur, then the greatest luxury of dress. In his hand
he bore that singular â€œabacusâ€, or staff of office, with which Templars
are usually represented, having at the upper end a round plate, on which
was engraved the cross of the Order, inscribed within a circle or orle,
as heralds term it. His companion, who attended on this great personage,
had nearly the same dress in all respects, but his extreme deference
towards his Superior showed that no other equality subsisted between
them. The Preceptor, for such he was in rank, walked not in a line with
the Grand Master, but just so far behind that Beaumanoir could speak to
him without turning round his head.

â€œConrade,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œdear companion of my battles and my
toils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can confide my sorrows. To thee
alone can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired
to be dissolved and to be with the just. Not one object in England hath
met mine eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of
our brethren, beneath the massive roof of our Temple Church in yonder
proud capital. O, valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I
gazed upon these good soldiers of the cross, where they lie sculptured
on their sepulchres,--O, worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble
cells, and take to your repose a weary brother, who would rather strive
with a hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our Holy
Order!â€

â€œIt is but true,â€ answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; â€œit is but too true;
and the irregularities of our brethren in England are even more gross
than those in France.â€

â€œBecause they are more wealthy,â€ answered the Grand Master. â€œBear with
me, brother, although I should something vaunt myself. Thou knowest the
life I have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with devils
embodied and disembodied, striking down the roaring lion, who goeth
about seeking whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout
priest, wheresoever I met with him--even as blessed Saint Bernard hath
prescribed to us in the forty-fifth capital of our rule, â€˜Ut Leo semper
feriaturâ€™. [49]

â€œBut by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and
my life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones; by that very Holy
Temple I swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still retain
the ancient severity of our Order, I look upon no brethren whom I can
bring my soul to embrace under that holy name. What say our statutes,
and how do our brethren observe them? They should wear no vain or
worldly ornament, no crest upon their helmet, no gold upon stirrup or
bridle-bit; yet who now go pranked out so proudly and so gaily as the
poor soldiers of the Temple? They are forbidden by our statutes to take
one bird by means of another, to shoot beasts with bow or arblast, to
halloo to a hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after game. But now,
at hunting and hawking, and each idle sport of wood and river, who so
prompt as the Templars in all these fond vanities? They are forbidden
to read, save what their Superior permitted, or listen to what is
read, save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the hours of
refaction; but lo! their ears are at the command of idle minstrels, and
their eyes study empty romaunts. They were commanded to extirpate magic
and heresy. Lo! they are charged with studying the accursed cabalistical
secrets of the Jews, and the magic of the Paynim Saracens. Simpleness
of diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage, gruels, eating flesh
but thrice a-week, because the accustomed feeding on flesh is a
dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their tables groan
under delicate fare! Their drink was to be water, and now, to drink like
a Templar, is the boast of each jolly boon companion! This very garden,
filled as it is with curious herbs and trees sent from the Eastern
climes, better becomes the harem of an unbelieving Emir, than the
plot which Christian Monks should devote to raise their homely
pot-herbs.--And O, Conrade! well it were that the relaxation of
discipline stopped even here!--Well thou knowest that we were forbidden
to receive those devout women, who at the beginning were associated
as sisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth chapter, the
Ancient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from the right
path to paradise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were, the
cope-stone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled
doctrine which he had enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even to
our sisters and our mothers, the kiss of affection--â€˜ut omnium
mulierum fugiantur osculaâ€™.--I shame to speak--I shame to think--of the
corruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood. The souls
of our pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint
Omer, and of the blessed Seven who first joined in dedicating their
lives to the service of the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment
of paradise itself. I have seen them, Conrade, in the visions of the
night--their sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their
brethren, and for the foul and shameful luxury in which they wallow.
Beaumanoir, they say, thou slumberest--awake! There is a stain in the
fabric of the Temple, deep and foul as that left by the streaks of
leprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old. [50]

â€œThe soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as the
eye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their own
race only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more
accursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!--Slay
the sinners, male and female!--Take to thee the brand of Phineas!--The
vision fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I could still hear the clank of
their mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.--And I will do
according to their word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and the
unclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out of the
building.â€

â€œYet bethink thee, reverend father,â€ said Mont-Fitchet, â€œthe stain
hath become engrained by time and consuetude; let thy reformation be
cautious, as it is just and wise.â€

â€œNo, Mont-Fitchet,â€ answered the stern old man--â€œit must be sharp
and sudden--the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,
self-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful
friends--our presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised up
against us mighty enemies.--We must cast away these riches, which are
a temptation to princes--we must lay down that presumption, which is
an offence to them--we must reform that license of manners, which is a
scandal to the whole Christian world! Or--mark my words--the Order of
the Temple will be utterly demolished--and the Place thereof shall no
more be known among the nations.â€

â€œNow may God avert such a calamity!â€ said the Preceptor.

â€œAmen,â€ said the Grand Master, with solemnity, â€œbut we must deserve his
aid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers in Heaven, nor
the powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this
generation--My intelligence is sure--the ground on which our fabric is
reared is already undermined, and each addition we make to the structure
of our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss. We must
retrace our steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of
the Cross, sacrificing to our calling, not alone our blood and our
lives--not alone our lusts and our vices--but our ease, our comforts,
and our natural affections, and act as men convinced that many a
pleasure which may be lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed
soldier of the Temple.â€

At this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the
aspirants after this holy Order wore during their noviciate the cast-off
garments of the knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing profoundly
before the Grand Master, stood silent, awaiting his permission ere he
presumed to tell his errand.

â€œIs it not more seemly,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œto see this Damian,
clothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear with reverend
silence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the fond fool
was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as proud as any
popinjay?--Speak, Damian, we permit thee--What is thine errand?â€

â€œA Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,â€ said the
Squire, â€œwho prays to speak with brother Brian de Bois-Guilbert.â€

â€œThou wert right to give me knowledge of it,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œin
our presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer of our Order, who
may not walk according to his own will, but to that of his Master--even
according to the text, â€˜In the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed
me.â€™--It imports us especially to know of this Bois-Guilbertâ€™s
proceedings,â€ said he, turning to his companion.

â€œReport speaks him brave and valiant,â€ said Conrade.

â€œAnd truly is he so spoken of,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œin our valour
only we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroes of the
Cross. But brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed
man, stirred, I doubt me, to take our vows and to renounce the world,
not in sincerity of soul, but as one whom some touch of light discontent
had driven into penitence. Since then, he hath become an active and
earnest agitator, a murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader amongst
those who impugn our authority; not considering that the rule is given
to the Master even by the symbol of the staff and the rod--the staff to
support the infirmities of the weak--the rod to correct the faults of
delinquents.--Damian,â€ he continued, â€œlead the Jew to our presence.â€

The squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes
returned, marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave, ushered into the
presence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat with
more profound reverence and terror than that with which the Jew drew
near to the presence of the Grand Master. When he had approached within
the distance of three yards, Beaumanoir made a sign with his staff that
he should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down on the earth which he
kissed in token of reverence; then rising, stood before the Templars,
his hands folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast, in all the
submission of Oriental slavery.

â€œDamian,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œretire, and have a guard ready to
await our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the garden until we
shall leave it.â€--The squire bowed and retreated.--â€œJew,â€ continued the
haughty old man, â€œmark me. It suits not our condition to hold with
thee long communication, nor do we waste words or time upon any one.
Wherefore be brief in thy answers to what questions I shall ask thee,
and let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue doubles with me, I will
have it torn from thy misbelieving jaws.â€

The Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.

â€œPeace, unbeliever!--not a word in our presence, save in answer to
our questions.--What is thy business with our brother Brian de
Bois-Guilbert?â€

Isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be
interpreted into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, what
hope could he have of achieving his daughterâ€™s deliverance? Beaumanoir
saw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some
assurance.

â€œFear nothing,â€ he said, â€œfor thy wretched person, Jew, so thou dealest
uprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from thee thy business
with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?â€

â€œI am bearer of a letter,â€ stammered out the Jew, â€œso please your
reverend valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of the Abbey of
Jorvaulx.â€

â€œSaid I not these were evil times, Conrade?â€ said the Master. â€œA
Cistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and can find
no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.--Give me the letter.â€

The Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in
which he had deposited the Priorâ€™s tablets for the greater security, and
was about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to place it
within the reach of his grim interrogator.

â€œBack, dog!â€ said the Grand Master; â€œI touch not misbelievers, save with
the sword.--Conrade, take thou the letter from the Jew, and give it to
me.â€

Beaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside
carefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its
folds. â€œReverend father,â€ said Conrade, interposing, though with much
deference, â€œwilt thou break the seal?â€

â€œAnd will I not?â€ said Beaumanoir, with a frown. â€œIs it not written in
the forty-second capital, â€˜De Lectione Literarumâ€™ that a Templar shall
not receive a letter, no not from his father, without communicating the
same to the Grand Master, and reading it in his presence?â€

He then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and
horror; read it over again more slowly; then holding it out to Conrade
with one hand, and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed--â€œHere
is goodly stuff for one Christian man to write to another, and both
members, and no inconsiderable members, of religious professions! When,â€
 said he solemnly, and looking upward, â€œwilt thou come with thy fanners
to purge the thrashing-floor?â€

Mont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse
it.

â€œRead it aloud, Conrade,â€ said the Grand Master,--â€œand do thouâ€
 (to Isaac) â€œattend to the purport of it, for we will question thee
concerning it.â€

Conrade read the letter, which was in these words: â€œAymer, by divine
grace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Maryâ€™s of Jorvaulx, to
Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple,
wisheth health, with the bounties of King Bacchus and of my Lady Venus.
Touching our present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the
hands of certain lawless and godless men, who have not feared to detain
our person, and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of
Front-de-Boeufâ€™s misfortune, and that thou hast escaped with that fair
Jewish sorceress, whose black eyes have bewitched thee. We are heartily
rejoiced of thy safety; nevertheless, we pray thee to be on thy guard in
the matter of this second Witch of Endor; for we are privately assured
that your Great Master, who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks and
black eyes, comes from Normandy to diminish your mirth, and amend your
misdoings. Wherefore we pray you heartily to beware, and to be found
watching, even as the Holy Text hath it, â€˜Invenientur vigilantesâ€™. And
the wealthy Jew her father, Isaac of York, having prayed of me letters
in his behalf, I gave him these, earnestly advising, and in a sort
entreating, that you do hold the damsel to ransom, seeing he will pay
you from his bags as much as may find fifty damsels upon safer terms,
whereof I trust to have my part when we make merry together, as true
brothers, not forgetting the wine-cup. For what saith the text, â€˜Vinum
laetificat cor hominisâ€™; and again, â€˜Rex delectabitur pulchritudine
tuaâ€™.

â€œTill which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of
thieves, about the hour of matins,

â€œAymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.

â€œâ€˜Postscriptum.â€™ Truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me,
and will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw deer-stealer, the
whistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.â€

â€œWhat sayest thou to this, Conrade?â€ said the Grand Master--â€œDen of
thieves! and a fit residence is a den of thieves for such a Prior. No
wonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy Land we
lose place by place, foot by foot, before the infidels, when we have
such churchmen as this Aymer.--And what meaneth he, I trow, by this
second Witch of Endor?â€ said he to his confident, something apart.
Conrade was better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of
gallantry, than was his Superior; and he expounded the passage which
embarrassed the Grand Master, to be a sort of language used by worldly
men towards those whom they loved â€˜par amoursâ€™; but the explanation did
not satisfy the bigoted Beaumanoir.

â€œThere is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is
no match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca of York was a
pupil of that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew
own it even now.â€ Then turning to Isaac, he said aloud, â€œThy daughter,
then, is prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?â€

â€œAy, reverend valorous sir,â€ stammered poor Isaac, â€œand whatsoever
ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance---â€

â€œPeace!â€ said the Grand Master. â€œThis thy daughter hath practised the
art of healing, hath she not?â€

â€œAy, gracious sir,â€ answered the Jew, with more confidence; â€œand knight
and yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly gift which Heaven
hath assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath recovered
them by her art, when every other human aid hath proved vain; but the
blessing of the God of Jacob was upon her.â€

Beaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. â€œSee, brother,â€
 he said, â€œthe deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold the baits
with which he fishes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life in
exchange for eternal happiness hereafter. Well said our blessed
rule, â€˜Semper percutiatur leo voransâ€™.--Up on the lion! Down with the
destroyer!â€ said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, as if in defiance
of the powers of darkness--â€œThy daughter worketh the cures, I doubt
not,â€ thus he went on to address the Jew, â€œby words and sighs, and
periapts, and other cabalistical mysteries.â€

â€œNay, reverend and brave Knight,â€ answered Isaac, â€œbut in chief measure
by a balsam of marvellous virtue.â€

â€œWhere had she that secret?â€ said Beaumanoir.

â€œIt was delivered to her,â€ answered Isaac, reluctantly, â€œby Miriam, a
sage matron of our tribe.â€

â€œAh, false Jew!â€ said the Grand Master; â€œwas it not from that same
witch Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of
throughout every Christian land?â€ exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing
himself. â€œHer body was burnt at a stake, and her ashes were scattered to
the four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as
much to her pupil, and more also! I will teach her to throw spell and
incantation over the soldiers of the blessed Temple.--There, Damian,
spurn this Jew from the gate--shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again.
With his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high
office warrant.â€

Poor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the
preceptory; all his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard and
disregarded. He could do not better than return to the house of the
Rabbi, and endeavour, through his means, to learn how his daughter was
to be disposed of. He had hitherto feared for her honour, he was now
to tremble for her life. Meanwhile, the Grand Master ordered to his
presence the Preceptor of Templestowe.




CHAPTER XXXVI

     Say not my art is fraud--all live by seeming.
     The beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier
     Gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;
     The clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier
     Will eke with it his service.--All admit it,
     All practise it; and he who is content
     With showing what he is, shall have small credit
     In church, or camp, or state--So wags the world.
     --Old Play

Albert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order, Preceptor
of the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that Philip
Malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history,
and was, like that baron, in close league with Brian de Bois-Guilbert.

Amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order
included but too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished; but
with this difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew how
to throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to
assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised.
Had not the arrival of the Grand Master been so unexpectedly sudden,
he would have seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to
argue any relaxation of discipline. And, even although surprised, and,
to a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such
respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made
such haste to reform the particulars he censured,--succeeded, in fine,
so well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been
lately devoted to license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began to
entertain a higher opinion of the Preceptorâ€™s morals, than the first
appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.

But these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were
greatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a
house of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the
paramour of a brother of the Order; and when Albert appeared before him,
he was regarded with unwonted sternness.

â€œThere is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order
of the Temple,â€ said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, â€œa Jewish
woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir
Preceptor.â€

Albert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate
Rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building,
and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being
known. He read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to
himself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.

â€œWhy are you mute?â€ continued the Grand Master.

â€œIs it permitted to me to reply?â€ answered the Preceptor, in a tone of
the deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an
instantâ€™s space for arranging his ideas.

â€œSpeak, you are permitted,â€ said the Grand Master--â€œspeak, and say,
knowest thou the capital of our holy rule,--â€˜De commilitonibus Templi
in sancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter
oblectationem carnis?â€™â€ [51]

â€œSurely, most reverend father,â€ answered the Preceptor, â€œI have not
risen to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most
important prohibitions.â€

â€œHow comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered
a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish sorceress,
into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?â€

â€œA Jewish sorceress!â€ echoed Albert Malvoisin; â€œgood angels guard us!â€

â€œAy, brother, a Jewish sorceress!â€ said the Grand Master, sternly. â€œI
have said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that
wretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch
Miriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy
Preceptory?â€

â€œYour wisdom, reverend father,â€ answered the Preceptor, â€œhath rolled
away the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good
a knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the
charms of this female, whom I received into this house merely to place a
bar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented
at the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother.â€

â€œHath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?â€
 demanded the Grand Master.

â€œWhat! under this roof?â€ said the Preceptor, crossing himself; â€œSaint
Magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!--No! if I have sinned in
receiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus break
off our brotherâ€™s besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed to me
so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some touch of
insanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since your reverend
wisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a sorceress, perchance it
may account fully for his enamoured folly.â€

â€œIt doth!--it doth!â€ said Beaumanoir. â€œSee, brother Conrade, the peril
of yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan! We look
upon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure
in what men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion,
obtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work
which was begun by idleness and folly. It may be that our brother
Bois-Guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe
chastisement; rather the support of the staff, than the strokes of the
rod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly,
and restore him to his brethren.â€

â€œIt were deep pity,â€ said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, â€œto lose to the Order
one of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid of
its sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert slain
with his own hand.â€

â€œThe blood of these accursed dogs,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œshall be a
sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise
and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and
charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall burst
the bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords with which
the Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even
heaps upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who hath flung her
enchantments over a brother of the Holy Temple, assuredly she shall die
the death.â€

â€œBut the laws of England,â€--said the Preceptor, who, though delighted
that the Grand Masterâ€™s resentment, thus fortunately averted from
himself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to
fear he was carrying it too far.

â€œThe laws of England,â€ interrupted Beaumanoir, â€œpermit and enjoin each
judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most petty
baron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain.
And shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within
a preceptory of his Order?--No!--we will judge and condemn. The witch
shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be
forgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.â€

Albert Malvoisin bowed and retired,--not to give directions for
preparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and
communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not
long ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had
anew sustained from the fair Jewess. â€œThe unthinking,â€ he said, â€œthe
ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved
her life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until
roof and rafters crackled and crashed around me. I was the butt of a
hundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against
a latticed casement, and the only use I made of my shield was for her
protection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl
upbraids me that I did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only
the slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that
ever she will be brought to grant any. The devil, that possessed her
race with obstinacy, has concentrated its full force in her single
person!â€

â€œThe devil,â€ said the Preceptor, â€œI think, possessed you both. How oft
have I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell you
that there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who
would think it sin to refuse so brave a knight â€˜le don dâ€™amoureux
merciâ€™, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate
Jewess! By the mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when he
maintains she hath cast a spell over you.â€

â€œLucas Beaumanoir!â€--said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully--â€œAre these your
precautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that
Rebecca is in the Preceptory?â€

â€œHow could I help it?â€ said the Preceptor. â€œI neglected nothing that
could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the
devil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I
could; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied--the victim
of magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.â€

â€œShe shall not, by Heaven!â€ said Bois-Guilbert.

â€œBy Heaven, she must and will!â€ said Malvoisin. â€œNeither you nor any
one else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of
a Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous
indulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the
power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.â€

â€œWill future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!â€ said
Bois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.

â€œWhat they may believe, I know not,â€ said Malvoisin, calmly; â€œbut I know
well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to the
hundred, will cry â€˜amenâ€™ to the Grand Masterâ€™s sentence.â€

â€œI have it,â€ said Bois-Guilbert. â€œAlbert, thou art my friend. Thou must
connive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some place
of greater security and secrecy.â€

â€œI cannot, if I would,â€ replied the Preceptor; â€œthe mansion is filled
with the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted to
him. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you
in this matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have
risked enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a
sentence of degradation, or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake
of a painted piece of Jewish flesh and blood. And you, if you will be
guided by my counsel, will give up this wild-goose chase, and fly your
hawk at some other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,--thy present rank, thy
future honours, all depend on thy place in the Order. Shouldst thou
adhere perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give
Beaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He
is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and
he knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will
ruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of
a Jewish sorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst
not control him. When the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest
caress the daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own
humour.â€

â€œMalvoisin,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œthou art a cold-blooded--â€

â€œFriend,â€ said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which
Bois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,--â€œa cold-blooded
friend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I tell thee
once more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once more,
thou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master--throw
thyself at his feet and tell him--â€

â€œNot at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotardâ€™s very beard will I
say--â€

â€œSay to him, then, to his beard,â€ continued Malvoisin, coolly, â€œthat you
love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost enlarge
on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of
the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by the avowal
of a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren,
and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to
lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between
Flanders and Burgundy.â€

â€œThou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,â€ said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, after
a momentâ€™s reflection. â€œI will give the hoary bigot no advantage over
me; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should
expose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast her off--yes, I will
leave her to her fate, unless--â€

â€œQualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,â€ said Malvoisin; â€œwomen
are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours--ambition is the serious
business of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this Jewess,
before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched
before thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close
conversation--I must order the hall for his judgment-seat.â€

â€œWhat!â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œso soon?â€

â€œAy,â€ replied the Preceptor, â€œtrial moves rapidly on when the judge has
determined the sentence beforehand.â€

â€œRebecca,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, â€œthou art like
to cost me dear--Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm
hypocrite recommends?--One effort will I make to save thee--but beware
of ingratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my
love. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where
contempt and reproaches are his only reward.â€

The Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined
by Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Masterâ€™s
resolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.

â€œIt is surely a dream,â€ said the Preceptor; â€œwe have many Jewish
physicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful
cures.â€

â€œThe Grand Master thinks otherwise,â€ said Mont-Fitchet; â€œand, Albert,
I will be upright with thee--wizard or not, it were better that this
miserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost to
the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest his
high rank, his fame in arms--thou knowest the zeal with which many of
our brethren regard him--but all this will not avail him with our Grand
Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of
this Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it
were better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert were partner in
her destruction.â€

â€œI have been working him even now to abandon her,â€ said Malvoisin;
â€œbut still, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for
sorcery?--Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that
the proofs are so weak?â€

â€œThey must be strengthened, Albert,â€ replied Mont-Fitchet, â€œthey must be
strengthened. Dost thou understand me?â€

â€œI do,â€ said the Preceptor, â€œnor do I scruple to do aught for
advancement of the Order--but there is little time to find engines
fitting.â€

â€œMalvoisin, they MUST be found,â€ said Conrade; â€œwell will it advantage
both the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor Preceptory--that of
Maison-Dieu is worth double its value--thou knowest my interest with our
old Chief--find those who can carry this matter through, and thou art
Preceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent--How sayst thou?â€

â€œThere is,â€ replied Malvoisin, â€œamong those who came hither with
Bois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my
brother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of
Front-de-Boeuf--It may be they know something of the witcheries of this
woman.â€

â€œAway, seek them out instantly--and hark thee, if a byzant or two will
sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.â€

â€œThey would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,â€
 said the Preceptor.

â€œAway, then,â€ said Mont-Fitchet; â€œat noon the affair will proceed. I
have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned
to the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.â€

The ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca
heard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place
of confinement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and
the circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the
solitary visits of the fierce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of
any evil that could befall her besides. The door of the chamber was
unlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by
four warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.

â€œDaughter of an accursed race!â€ said the Preceptor, â€œarise and follow
us.â€

â€œWhither,â€ said Rebecca, â€œand for what purpose?â€

â€œDamsel,â€ answered Conrade, â€œit is not for thee to question, but to
obey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought
before the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to
answer for thine offences.â€

â€œMay the God of Abraham be praised!â€ said Rebecca, folding her hands
devoutly; â€œthe name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me
as the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee--permit me
only to wrap my veil around my head.â€

They descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long
gallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the
great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his
court of justice.

The lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and
yeomen, who made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended
by the Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of
halberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her. As she
passed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a
scrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she received almost
unconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents. The
assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave
her courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she had
been conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon the scene, which we shall
endeavour to describe in the next chapter.




CHAPTER XXXVII

     Stern was the law which bade its votâ€™ries leave
     At human woes with human hearts to grieve;
     Stern was the law, which at the winning wile
     Of frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;
     But sterner still, when high the iron-rod
     Of tyrant power she shook, and callâ€™d that power of God.
     --The Middle Ages

The Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy Rebecca,
occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall--a
platform, which we have already described as the place of honour,
destined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests
of an ancient mansion.

On an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master
of the Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his
hand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet
was placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order,
whose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the day.
The black dresses, bare scalps, and demure looks of these church-men,
formed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the knights who
attended, either as residing in the Preceptory, or as come thither to
attend upon their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom there were four
present, occupied seats lower in height, and somewhat drawn back behind
that of their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed no such rank in
the Order, were placed on benches still lower, and preserving the same
distance from the Preceptors as these from the Grand Master. Behind
them, but still upon the dais or elevated portion of the hall, stood the
esquires of the Order, in white dresses of an inferior quality.

The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in
the faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring,
united with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession,
and which, in the presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit upon
every brow.

The remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards, holding
partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn thither,
to see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far the greater
part of those inferior persons were, in one rank or other, connected
with the Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their black
dresses. But peasants from the neighbouring country were not refused
admittance; for it was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the edifying
spectacle of the justice which he administered as public as possible.
His large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the assembly,
and his countenance appeared elated by the conscious dignity, and
imaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A psalm,
which he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age had not
deprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day; and the
solemn sounds, â€œVenite exultemus Dominoâ€, so often sung by the Templars
before engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged by Lucas most
appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed
it, over the powers of darkness. The deep prolonged notes, raised by
a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant,
arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolled on amongst its arches
with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters.

When the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around
the circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was
vacant. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left
his place, and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the
benches occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand
extending his long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face;
while the other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which,
sheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.

â€œUnhappy man!â€ said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance
of compassion. â€œThou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses him.
To this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers
of this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!--Seest thou he cannot
look upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse
from his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the
floor?--It may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at
and defy the foul enemy. â€˜Semper Leo percutiatur!â€™â€

This was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade
Mont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the
assembly.

â€œReverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this
Holy Order, my brethren and my children!--you also, well-born and pious
Esquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!--and you also, Christian
brethren, of every degree!--Be it known to you, that it is not defect of
power in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation;
for, however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed, with this
batoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of
this our Holy Order. Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly and
religious profession, hath said, in the fifty-ninth capital, [53] that
he would not that brethren be called together in council, save at the
will and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those more
worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office, to judge, as
well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of the
whole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all such
chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to
proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath
made an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is
the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with
bows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known
rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have therefore
summoned to our presence a Jewish woman, by name Rebecca, daughter
of Isaac of York--a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries;
whereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a
churl, but of a Knight--not of a secular Knight, but of one devoted
to the service of the Holy Temple--not of a Knight Companion, but of a
Preceptor of our Order, first in honour as in place. Our brother, Brian
de Bois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now
hear me, as a true and zealous champion of the Cross, by whose arm many
deeds of valour have been wrought in the Holy Land, and the holy places
purified from pollution by the blood of those infidels who defiled them.
Neither have our brotherâ€™s sagacity and prudence been less in repute
among his brethren than his valour and discipline; in so much, that
knights, both in eastern and western lands, have named De Bois-Guilbert
as one who may well be put in nomination as successor to this batoon,
when it shall please Heaven to release us from the toil of bearing
it. If we were told that such a man, so honoured, and so honourable,
suddenly casting away regard for his character, his vows, his brethren,
and his prospects, had associated to himself a Jewish damsel, wandered
in this lewd company, through solitary places, defended her person in
preference to his own, and, finally, was so utterly blinded and besotted
by his folly, as to bring her even to one of our own Preceptories,
what should we say but that the noble knight was possessed by some
evil demon, or influenced by some wicked spell?--If we could suppose
it otherwise, think not rank, valour, high repute, or any earthly
consideration, should prevent us from visiting him with punishment, that
the evil thing might be removed, even according to the text, â€˜Auferte
malum ex vobisâ€™. For various and heinous are the acts of transgression
against the rule of our blessed Order in this lamentable history.--1st,
He hath walked according to his proper will, contrary to capital 33,
â€˜Quod nullus juxta propriam voluntatem incedatâ€™.--2d, He hath held
communication with an excommunicated person, capital 57, â€˜Ut fratres
non participent cum excommunicatisâ€™, and therefore hath a portion
in â€˜Anathema Maranathaâ€™.--3d, He hath conversed with strange women,
contrary to the capital, â€˜Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis
mulieribusâ€™.--4th, He hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be
feared, solicited the kiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of
our renowned Order, â€˜Ut fugiantur osculaâ€™, the soldiers of the Cross are
brought into a snare. For which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de
Bois-Guilbert should be cut off and cast out from our congregation, were
he the right hand and right eye thereof.â€

He paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger
part, who had been inclined to smile at the statute â€˜De osculis
fugiendisâ€™, became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the Grand
Master was next to propose.

â€œSuch,â€ he said, â€œand so great should indeed be the punishment of a
Knight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his Order in
such weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan had
obtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his eyes
too lightly upon a damselâ€™s beauty, we are then rather to lament than
chastise his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance as
may purify him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of
our indignation upon the accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh
occasioned his utter falling away.--Stand forth, therefore, and bear
witness, ye who have witnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge
of the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be
satisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must
go on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our
brother.â€

Several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which
Bois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the
blazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to
her safety. The men gave these details with the exaggerations common to
vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event,
and their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased
by the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent
person for whose information it had been delivered. Thus the dangers
which Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently great, became
portentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight to Rebeccaâ€™s
defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of discretion, but
even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference
to what she said, even although her language was often severe and
upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his
haughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.

The Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner
in which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The
evidence of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently
studied to spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time
to time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some
temporary alienation of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of
the damsel whom he brought along with him. With sighs of penitence, the
Preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and
her lover within the walls of the Preceptory--â€œBut my defence,â€ he
concluded, â€œhas been made in my confession to our most reverend father
the Grand Master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct
may have been irregular. Joyfully will I submit to any penance he shall
assign me.â€

â€œThou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,â€ said Beaumanoir; â€œthy motives
were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring
brother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong;
as he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup
instead of the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of
accomplishing his purpose. Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our
pious founder for matins, and nine for vespers; be those services
doubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars permitted the use of flesh;
but do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This do for six weeks to
come, and thy penance is accomplished.â€

With a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of
Templestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his
seat.

â€œWere it not well, brethren,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œthat we examine
something into the former life and conversation of this woman, specially
that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical charms
and spells, since the truths which we have heard may well incline us to
suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother has been acted
upon by some infernal enticement and delusion?â€

Herman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other
three were Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an
ancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the
sabre of the Moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his
brethren. He arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted
him license of speech. â€œI would crave to know, most Reverend Father,
of our valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these
wondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his
unhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?â€

â€œBrian de Bois-Guilbert,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œthou hearest the
question which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer.
I command thee to reply to him.â€

Bois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus
addressed, and remained silent.

â€œHe is possessed by a dumb devil,â€ said the Grand Master. â€œAvoid thee,
Sathanus!--Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee, by this symbol
of our Holy Order.â€

Bois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and
indignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would have
little availed him. â€œBrian de Bois-Guilbert,â€ he answered, â€œreplies not,
most Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If his honour be
impeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that sword which
has often fought for Christendom.â€

â€œWe forgive thee, Brother Brian,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œthough that
thou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a glorifying of
thine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our
own worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less of
thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heavenâ€™s
leave, we will quell and drive forth from our assembly.â€ A glance of
disdain flashed from the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made
no reply.--â€œAnd now,â€ pursued the Grand Master, â€œsince our Brother of
Goodalrickeâ€™s question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we our
quest, brethren, and with our patronâ€™s assistance, we will search to the
bottom this mystery of iniquity.--Let those who have aught to witness of
the life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth before us.â€
 There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when the Grand
Master enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the crowd a
bedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect use of his
limbs, by a miraculous balsam.

The poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar,
terrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the
guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly
cured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on crutches
to give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many
tears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at York, he
was suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring for Isaac
the rich Jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to
stir from his bed until the remedies applied by Rebeccaâ€™s directions,
and especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree
restored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said, she had given
him a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of
money withal, to return to the house of his father, near to Templestowe.
â€œAnd may it please your gracious Reverence,â€ said the man, â€œI cannot
think the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a
Jewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the Pater and the Creed,
and it never operated a whit less kindly--â€

â€œPeace, slave,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œand begone! It well suits brutes
like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and to be
giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the fiend can
impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in order to bring
into credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou that unguent of
which thou speakest?â€

The peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a
small box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with
most of the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary.
Beaumanoir, after crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and,
learned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the
lid,--â€œThe Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.â€

â€œStrange powers of Sathanas.â€ said he, â€œwhich can convert Scripture into
blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!--Is there no leech
here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?â€

Two mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other
a barber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials,
excepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to
be Oriental herbs. But with the true professional hatred to a successful
practitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the medicine was
beyond their own knowledge, it must necessarily have been compounded
from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they themselves, though
no conjurors, fully understood every branch of their art, so far as it
might be exercised with the good faith of a Christian. When this medical
research was ended, the Saxon peasant desired humbly to have back the
medicine which he had found so salutary; but the Grand Master frowned
severely at the request. â€œWhat is thy name, fellow?â€ said he to the
cripple.

â€œHigg, the son of Snell,â€ answered the peasant.

â€œThen Higg, son of Snell,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œI tell thee it is
better to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of unbelieversâ€™
medicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil infidels
of their treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them benevolent
gifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.â€

â€œAlack,â€ said the peasant, â€œan it shall not displease your Reverence,
the lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I will
tell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that
your mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him
faithful service.â€

â€œOut with the prating villain!â€ said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared to
refute this practical application of his general maxim.

Higg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the
fate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even
at the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the
terror of which withered his very heart within him.

At this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to
unveil herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied
patiently, but with dignity,--â€œThat it was not the wont of the daughters
of her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of
strangers.â€ The sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her
reply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. But
Beaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity
which could interfere with his imagined duty, was a virtue of itself,
repeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The guards
were about to remove her veil accordingly, when she stood up before
the Grand Master and said, â€œNay, but for the love of your own
daughters--Alas,â€ she said, recollecting herself, â€œye have no
daughters!--yet for the remembrance of your mothers--for the love of
your sisters, and of female decency, let me not be thus handled in your
presence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I
will obey you,â€ she added, with an expression of patient sorrow in her
voice, which had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; â€œye are
elders among your people, and at your command I will show the features
of an ill-fated maiden.â€

She withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which
bashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a
murmur of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their
eyes, in silent correspondence, that Brianâ€™s best apology was in the
power of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But
Higg, the son of Snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the
sight of the countenance of his benefactress.

â€œLet me go forth,â€ he said to the warders at the door of the hall,--â€œlet
me go forth!--To look at her again will kill me, for I have had a share
in murdering her.â€

â€œPeace, poor man,â€ said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; â€œthou
hast done me no harm by speaking the truth--thou canst not aid me by
thy complaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee--go home and save
thyself.â€

Higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders,
who were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them
reprehension, and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be silent,
and was permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom Albert
Malvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their
testimony, were now called forward. Though both were hardened and
inflexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as well as her
excelling beauty, at first appeared to stagger them; but an expressive
glance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their dogged
composure; and they delivered, with a precision which would have seemed
suspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether
fictitious or trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant
with suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and
the sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. The
circumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days, divided
into two classes--those which were immaterial, and those which were
actually and physically impossible. But both were, in those ignorant
and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of guilt.--The first
class set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter to herself in an
unknown tongue--that the songs she sung by fits were of a strangely
sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and his heart
throb--that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward
for a reply--that her garments were of a strange and mystic form,
unlike those of women of good repute--that she had rings impressed with
cabalistical devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her
veil.

All these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely
listened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that
Rebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.

But there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of
the assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however
incredible. One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded
man, brought with them to the castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said,
make certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious
words, which he blessed God he understood not, when the iron head of a
square cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding was
stanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a quarter
of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in
managing a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This legend was
probably founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on the
wounded Ivanhoe when in the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the
more difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to
produce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony, he drew from
his pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been
miraculously extracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full
ounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however marvellous.

His comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the
scene betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of
precipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his
companion, this fellow stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself
upon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white
swan, under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of
Torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the
female form.

Less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient
to convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a
Jewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too
weighty for Rebeccaâ€™s youth, though combined with the most exquisite
beauty.

The Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn
tone demanded of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of
condemnation, which he was about to pronounce.

â€œTo invoke your pity,â€ said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat
tremulous with emotion, â€œwould, I am aware, be as useless as I should
hold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another
religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our
faiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men
(whom may Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would
avail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still
less would it advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my
dress, language, and manners, are those of my people--I had well-nigh
said of my country, but alas! we have no country. Nor will I even
vindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there
listening to the fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant
into the victim.--God be judge between him and me! but rather would I
submit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me,
than listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon
me--friendless, defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own
faith, and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn
protestations of the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to
himself the charge brought against me--but to himself--Yes, Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not
false? as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?â€

There was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was
silent.

â€œSpeak,â€ she said, â€œif thou art a man--if thou art a Christian,
speak!--I conjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by the name
thou dost inherit--by the knighthood thou dost vaunt--by the honour of
thy mother--by the tomb and the bones of thy father--I conjure thee to
say, are these things true?â€

â€œAnswer her, brother,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œif the Enemy with whom
thou dost wrestle will give thee power.â€

In fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which
almost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that
at last he replied, looking to Rebecca,--â€œThe scroll!--the scroll!â€

â€œAy,â€ said Beaumanoir, â€œthis is indeed testimony! The victim of her
witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which
is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.â€

But Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were
from Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment
which she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in
the Arabian character, â€œDemand a Champion!â€ The murmuring commentary
which ran through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert,
gave Rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll
unobserved. When the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.

â€œRebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy
knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too powerful.
Hast thou aught else to say?â€

â€œThere is yet one chance of life left to me,â€ said Rebecca, â€œeven by
your own fierce laws. Life has been miserable--miserable, at least, of
late--but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me the
means of defending it. I deny this charge--I maintain my innocence, and
I declare the falsehood of this accusation--I challenge the privilege of
trial by combat, and will appear by my champion.â€

â€œAnd who, Rebecca,â€ replied the Grand Master, â€œwill lay lance in rest
for a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?â€

â€œGod will raise me up a champion,â€ said Rebecca--â€œIt cannot be that in
merry England--the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so many are
ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one
to fight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by
combat--there lies my gage.â€

She took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before
the Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which
excited universal surprise and admiration.




CHAPTER XXXVIII

     ---There I throw my gage,
     To prove it on thee to the extremest point
     Of martial daring.
     --Richard II

Even Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance
of Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but
with passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of
duty, his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he
pursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity
of subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he conceived
peculiarly incumbent on him. His features relaxed in their usual
severity as he gazed upon the beautiful creature before him, alone,
unfriended, and defending herself with so much spirit and courage. He
crossed himself twice, as doubting whence arose the unwonted softening
of a heart, which on such occasions used to resemble in hardness the
steel of his sword. At length he spoke.

â€œDamsel,â€ he said, â€œif the pity I feel for thee arise from any practice
thine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I rather judge
it the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form
should be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter--confess thy
witchcrafts--turn thee from thine evil faith--embrace this holy
emblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. In some
sisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and
fitting penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. This do and
live--what has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die
for it?â€

â€œIt was the law of my fathers,â€ said Rebecca; â€œit was delivered in
thunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud and in fire.
This, if ye are Christians, ye believe--it is, you say, recalled; but so
my teachers have not taught me.â€

â€œLet our chaplain,â€ said Beaumanoir, â€œstand forth, and tell this
obstinate infidel--â€

â€œForgive the interruption,â€ said Rebecca, meekly; â€œI am a maiden,
unskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it be
Godâ€™s will.--Let me pray your answer to my demand of a champion.â€

â€œGive me her glove,â€ said Beaumanoir. â€œThis is indeed,â€ he continued, as
he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, â€œa slight and frail
gage for a purpose so deadly!--Seest thou, Rebecca, as this thin and
light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so is
thy cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast
defied.â€

â€œCast my innocence into the scale,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œand the glove of
silk shall outweigh the glove of iron.â€

â€œThen thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that
bold challenge which thou hast made?â€

â€œI do persist, noble sir,â€ answered Rebecca.

â€œSo be it then, in the name of Heaven,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œand may
God show the right!â€

â€œAmen,â€ replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply
echoed by the whole assembly.

â€œBrethren,â€ said Beaumanoir, â€œyou are aware that we might well have
refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat--but though a
Jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and
God forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it
should be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well
as men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to
refuse proffered combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca,
the daughter of Isaac of York, is, by many frequent and suspicious
circumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble
knight of our holy Order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her
innocence. To whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should
deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our
champion on the field?â€

â€œTo Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,â€ said the
Preceptor of Goodalricke, â€œand who, moreover, best knows how the truth
stands in this matter.â€

â€œBut if,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œour brother Brian be under the
influence of a charm or a spell--we speak but for the sake of
precaution, for to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more
willingly confide this or a more weighty cause.â€

â€œReverend father,â€ answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, â€œno spell can
effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of God.â€

â€œThou sayest right, brother,â€ said the Grand Master. â€œAlbert Malvoisin,
give this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.--It is our charge to
thee, brother,â€ he continued, addressing himself to Bois-Guilbert, â€œthat
thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause shall
triumph.--And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third
day from the present to find a champion.â€

â€œThat is but brief space,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œfor a stranger, who is
also of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life
and honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved
soldier.â€

â€œWe may not extend it,â€ answered the Grand Master; â€œthe field must be
foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the
fourth day from hence.â€

â€œGodâ€™s will be done!â€ said Rebecca; â€œI put my trust in Him, to whom an
instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.â€

â€œThou hast spoken well, damsel,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œbut well know
we who can array himself like an angel of light. It remains but to name
a fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.--Where
is the Preceptor of this house?â€

Albert Malvoisin, still holding Rebeccaâ€™s glove in his hand, was
speaking to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.

â€œHow!â€ said the Grand Master, â€œwill he not receive the gage?â€

â€œHe will--he doth, most Reverend Father,â€ said Malvoisin, slipping the
glove under his own mantle. â€œAnd for the place of combat, I hold the
fittest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory,
and used by us for military exercise.â€

â€œIt is well,â€ said the Grand Master.--â€œRebecca, in those lists shalt
thou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thy
champion shall be discomfited by the judgment of God, thou shalt then
die the death of a sorceress, according to doom.--Let this our judgment
be recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend
ignorance.â€

One of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately
engrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of
the Templar Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when
he had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the Grand
Master, which, when translated from the Norman-French in which it was
couched, was expressed as follows.--

â€œRebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of
sorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a Knight
of the most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and
saith, that the testimony delivered against her this day is false,
wicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful â€˜essoineâ€™ [54] of her body as
being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion
instead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal â€˜devoirâ€™ in
all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage of battle do fully
appertain, and that at her peril and cost. And therewith she proffered
her gage. And the gage having been delivered to the noble Lord and
Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion,
he was appointed to do this battle, in behalf of his Order and himself,
as injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant. Wherefore the
most reverend Father and puissant Lord, Lucas Marquis of Beaumanoir, did
allow of the said challenge, and of the said â€˜essoineâ€™ of the
appellantâ€™s body, and assigned the third day for the said combat, the
place being the enclosure called the lists of Saint George, near to the
Preceptory of Templestowe. And the Grand Master appoints the appellant
to appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a person convicted
of sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to appear, under the
penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default; and the
noble Lord and most reverend Father aforesaid appointed the battle to be
done in his own presence, and according to all that is commendable and
profitable in such a case. And may God aid the just cause!â€

â€œAmen!â€ said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all around.
Rebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,
remained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly
reminded the Grand Master, that she ought to be permitted some
opportunity of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of
making her condition known to them, and procuring, if possible, some
champion to fight in her behalf.

â€œIt is just and lawful,â€ said the Grand Master; â€œchoose what messenger
thou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication with thee in thy
prison-chamber.â€

â€œIs there,â€ said Rebecca, â€œany one here, who, either for love of a good
cause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed being?â€

All were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand
Master, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he
should be suspected of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect of
reward, far less any feelings of compassion alone, could surmount this
apprehension.

Rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then
exclaimed, â€œIs it really thus?--And, in English land, am I to be
deprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of
an act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal?â€

Higg, the son of Snell, at length replied, â€œI am but a maimed man,
but that I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable
assistance.--I will do thine errand,â€ he added, addressing Rebecca, â€œas
well as a crippled object can, and happy were my limbs fleet enough
to repair the mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy
charity, I little thought I was leading thee into danger!â€

â€œGod,â€ said Rebecca, â€œis the disposer of all. He can turn back the
captivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his
message the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac
of York--here is that will pay for horse and man--let him have this
scroll.--I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me,
but most truly do I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a
champion will be raised up for me. Farewell!--Life and death are in thy
haste.â€

The peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in Hebrew.
Many of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a document so
suspicious; but Higg was resolute in the service of his benefactress.
She had saved his body, he said, and he was confident she did not mean
to peril his soul.

â€œI will get me,â€ he said, â€œmy neighbour Buthanâ€™s good capul, [55] and I
will be at York within as brief space as man and beast may.â€

But as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a
quarter of a mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with two
riders, whom, by their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be
Jews; and, on approaching more nearly, discovered that one of them was
his ancient employer, Isaac of York. The other was the Rabbi Ben Samuel;
and both had approached as near to the Preceptory as they dared, on
hearing that the Grand Master had summoned a chapter for the trial of a
sorceress.

â€œBrother Ben Samuel,â€ said Isaac, â€œmy soul is disquieted, and I wot not
why. This charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil
practices on our people.â€

â€œBe of good comfort, brother,â€ said the physician; â€œthou canst deal with
the Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness, and canst
therefore purchase immunity at their hands--it rules the savage minds of
those ungodly men, even as the signet of the mighty Solomon was said
to command the evil genii.--But what poor wretch comes hither upon his
crutches, desiring, as I think, some speech of me?--Friend,â€ continued
the physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, â€œI refuse thee not the
aid of mine art, but I relieve not with one asper those who beg for alms
upon the highway. Out upon thee!--Hast thou the palsy in thy legs? then
let thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit thou beâ€™st unfit for
a speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for the warfare, or for the
service of a hasty master, yet there be occupations--How now, brother?â€
 said he, interrupting his harangue to look towards Isaac, who had but
glanced at the scroll which Higg offered, when, uttering a deep groan,
he fell from his mule like a dying man, and lay for a minute insensible.

The Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the
remedies which his art suggested for the recovery of his companion. He
had even taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about
to proceed to phlebotomy, when the object of his anxious solicitude
suddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to throw
dust on his grey hairs. The physician was at first inclined to ascribe
this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity; and,
adhering to his original purpose, began once again to handle his
implements. But Isaac soon convinced him of his error.

â€œChild of my sorrow,â€ he said, â€œwell shouldst thou be called Benoni,
instead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to the
grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!â€

â€œBrother,â€ said the Rabbi, in great surprise, â€œart thou a father in
Israel, and dost thou utter words like unto these?--I trust that the
child of thy house yet liveth?â€

â€œShe liveth,â€ answered Isaac; â€œbut it is as Daniel, who was called
Beltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She is captive
unto those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her,
sparing neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O! she was as a
crown of green palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night,
like the gourd of Jonah!--Child of my love!--child of my old age!--oh,
Rebecca, daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath
encompassed thee.â€

â€œYet read the scroll,â€ said the Rabbi; â€œperadventure it may be that we
may yet find out a way of deliverance.â€

â€œDo thou read, brother,â€ answered Isaac, â€œfor mine eyes are as a
fountain of water.â€

The physician read, but in their native language, the following words:--

â€œTo Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York,
peace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!--My
father, I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth
not--even for the crime of witchcraft. My father, if a strong man can be
found to do battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the
custom of the Nazarenes, and that within the lists of Templestowe, on
the third day from this time, peradventure our fathersâ€™ God will give
him strength to defend the innocent, and her who hath none to help her.
But if this may not be, let the virgins of our people mourn for me as
for one cast off, and for the hart that is stricken by the hunter, and
for the flower which is cut down by the scythe of the mower. Wherefore
look now what thou doest, and whether there be any rescue. One Nazarene
warrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf, even Wilfred, son of
Cedric, whom the Gentiles call Ivanhoe. But he may not yet endure
the weight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the tidings unto him, my
father; for he hath favour among the strong men of his people, and as
he was our companion in the house of bondage, he may find some one to do
battle for my sake. And say unto him, even unto him, even unto Wilfred,
the son of Cedric, that if Rebecca live, or if Rebecca die, she liveth
or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal. And if it be
the will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter, do not
thou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty; but betake
thyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, under the shadow
of the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen; for less
cruel are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob, than the
cruelties of the Nazarenes of England.â€

Isaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the
letter, and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of Oriental
sorrow, tearing his garments, besprinkling his head with dust, and
ejaculating, â€œMy daughter! my daughter! flesh of my flesh, and bone of
my bone!â€

â€œYet,â€ said the Rabbi, â€œtake courage, for this grief availeth nothing.
Gird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. It may
be he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath
favour in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes Coeur-de-Lion,
and the tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may
be that he may obtain his letter, and his signet, commanding these men
of blood, who take their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof,
that they proceed not in their purposed wickedness.â€

â€œI will seek him out,â€ said Isaac, â€œfor he is a good youth, and hath
compassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour, and
what other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?â€

â€œNay, but,â€ said the Rabbi, â€œthou speakest as one that knoweth not the
Gentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as with gold thou
buyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward to
find out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up and be doing, for great
sin it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the city of
York, where many warriors and strong men are assembled, and doubt not I
will find among them some one who will do battle for thy daughter; for
gold is their god, and for riches will they pawn their lives as well as
their lands.--Thou wilt fulfil, my brother, such promise as I may make
unto them in thy name?â€

â€œAssuredly, brother,â€ said Isaac, â€œand Heaven be praised that raised me
up a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not their full demand
at once, for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people that
they will ask pounds, and peradventure accept of ounces--Nevertheless,
be it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this thing, and what would
my gold avail me if the child of my love should perish!â€

â€œFarewell,â€ said the physician, â€œand may it be to thee as thy heart
desireth.â€

They embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The
crippled peasant remained for some time looking after them.

â€œThese dog-Jews!â€ said he; â€œto take no more notice of a free
guild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcised
Hebrew like themselves! They might have flung me a mancus or two,
however. I was not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls, and run
the risk of being bewitched, as more folks than one told me. And what
care I for the bit of gold that the wench gave me, if I am to come to
harm from the priest next Easter at confession, and be obliged to give
him twice as much to make it up with him, and be called the Jewâ€™s
flying post all my life, as it may hap, into the bargain? I think I was
bewitched in earnest when I was beside that girl!--But it was always so
with Jew or Gentile, whosoever came near her--none could stay when she
had an errand to go--and still, whenever I think of her, I would give
shop and tools to save her life.â€




CHAPTER XXXIX

     O maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,
     My bosom is proud as thine own.
     --Seward

It was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be
called such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door
of Rebeccaâ€™s prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then
engaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which
concluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English.

     When Israel, of the Lord beloved,
     Out of the land of bondage came,
     Her fatherâ€™s God before her moved,
     An awful guide, in smoke and flame.
     By day, along the astonishâ€™d lands
     The cloudy pillar glided slow;
     By night, Arabiaâ€™s crimsonâ€™d sands
     Returnâ€™d the fiery columnâ€™s glow.

     There rose the choral hymn of praise,
     And trump and timbrel answerâ€™d keen,
     And Zionâ€™s daughters pourâ€™d their lays,
     With priestâ€™s and warriorâ€™s voice between.
     No portents now our foes amaze,
     Forsaken Israel wanders lone;
     Our fathers would not know THY ways,
     And THOU hast left them to their own.

     But, present still, though now unseen;
     When brightly shines the prosperous day,
     Be thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen
     To temper the deceitful ray.
     And oh, when stoops on Judahâ€™s path
     In shade and storm the frequent night,
     Be THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,
     A burning, and a shining light!

     Our harps we left by Babelâ€™s streams,
     The tyrantâ€™s jest, the Gentileâ€™s scorn;
     No censer round our altar beams,
     And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.
     But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,
     The flesh of rams, I will not prize;
     A contrite heart, and humble thought,
     Are mine accepted sacrifice.

When the sounds of Rebeccaâ€™s devotional hymn had died away in silence,
the low knock at the door was again renewed. â€œEnter,â€ she said, â€œif
thou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy
entrance.â€

â€œI am,â€ said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, â€œfriend or
foe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.â€

Alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she
considered as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with
a cautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest
corner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she
could, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible.
She drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution,
as one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it,
being offered, to the utmost of her power.

â€œYou have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,â€ said the Templar; â€œor if I
must so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to fear me.â€

â€œI fear you not, Sir Knight,â€ replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn
breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; â€œmy trust is strong,
and I fear thee not.â€

â€œYou have no cause,â€ answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; â€œmy former frantic
attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are guards, over
whom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you to death,
Rebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one, even by me,
were my frenzy--for frenzy it is--to urge me so far.â€

â€œMay Heaven be praised!â€ said the Jewess; â€œdeath is the least of my
apprehensions in this den of evil.â€

â€œAy,â€ replied the Templar, â€œthe idea of death is easily received by the
courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A thrust with a
lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little--To you, a spring from
a dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors,
compared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me--I say this--perhaps
mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, Rebecca, than
thine are; but we know alike how to die for them.â€

â€œUnhappy man,â€ said the Jewess; â€œand art thou condemned to expose thy
life for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge
the solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which
is not bread--but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate on the
wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the
Rock of Ages.â€

â€œSilence, maiden,â€ answered the Templar; â€œsuch discourse now avails but
little. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as
misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted
course of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men
calls thy crime.â€

â€œAnd to whom--if such my fate--to whom do I owe this?â€ said Rebecca
â€œsurely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause, dragged
me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to
exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.â€

â€œThink not,â€ said the Templar, â€œthat I have so exposed thee; I would
have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as
ever I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.â€

â€œHad thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,â€ said
Rebecca, â€œI had thanked thee for thy care--as it is, thou hast claimed
merit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me,
preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.â€

â€œTruce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,â€ said the Templar; â€œI have my
own cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it.â€

â€œWhat is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?â€ said the Jewess; â€œspeak it
briefly.--If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou
hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to
myself--the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and I
have few moments to prepare for it.â€

â€œI perceive, Rebecca,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œthat thou dost continue to
burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I have
prevented.â€

â€œSir Knight,â€ said Rebecca, â€œI would avoid reproaches--But what is more
certain than that I owe my death to thine unbridled passion?â€

â€œYou err--you err,â€--said the Templar, hastily, â€œif you impute what
I could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.--Could I
guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of frantic
valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid self-torments
of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above
common sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our Order, who think
and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the
grounds of his opinions and actions?â€

â€œYet,â€ said Rebecca, â€œyou sate a judge upon me, innocent--most
innocent--as you knew me to be--you concurred in my condemnation, and,
if I aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my
guilt, and assure my punishment.â€

â€œThy patience, maiden,â€ replied the Templar. â€œNo race knows so well as
thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark as
to make advantage even of an adverse wind.â€

â€œLamented be the hour,â€ said Rebecca, â€œthat has taught such art to
the House of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the
stubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and
the denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before
strangers. It is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own
misdeeds and those of our fathers; but you--you who boast your freedom
as your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to
soothe the prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?â€

â€œYour words are bitter, Rebecca,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the
apartment with impatience, â€œbut I came not hither to bandy reproaches
with you.--Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although
circumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is
the mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside
by the rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. That scroll
which warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it
came, if not from Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou have excited
such interest?â€

â€œA brief respite from instant death,â€ said Rebecca, â€œwhich will little
avail me--was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou hast
heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the
tomb?â€

â€œNo maiden,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œthis was NOT all that I purposed. Had
it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and
the fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and
judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the
Champion Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion
of the Order. Then I myself--such was my purpose--had, on the sounding
of the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed
in the fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his
shield and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two
or three of the brethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them
out of the saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine
innocence have been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have
trusted for the reward of my victory.â€

â€œThis, Sir Knight,â€ said Rebecca, â€œis but idle boasting--a brag of what
you would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise. You
received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can find
one, must encounter your lance in the lists--yet you would assume the
air of my friend and protector!â€

â€œThy friend and protector,â€ said the Templar, gravely, â€œI will yet
be--but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of dishonour;
and then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all
that I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.â€

â€œSpeak,â€ said Rebecca; â€œI understand thee not.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œI will speak as freely as ever
did doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky
confessional.--Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and
rank--lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I mean,
in which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding to
that mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard Lucas
de Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such is my
certain doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause. Accursed be he
of Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed Albert
de Malvoisin, who withheld me from the resolution I had formed,
of hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and
superannuated fool, who listened to a charge so absurd, and against a
creature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!â€

â€œAnd what now avails rant or flattery?â€ answered Rebecca. â€œThou hast
made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent
woman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes--What
avails it to reckon together?--thy choice is made.â€

â€œNo, Rebecca,â€ said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer
towards her; â€œmy choice is NOT made--nay, mark, it is thine to make the
election. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms;
and if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and
faggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms on
equal issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and his
minion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear
his corslet, and Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou
diest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth
to enter the lists in thy defence.â€

â€œAnd what avails repeating this so often?â€ said Rebecca.

â€œMuch,â€ replied the Templar; â€œfor thou must learn to look at thy fate on
every side.â€

â€œWell, then, turn the tapestry,â€ said the Jewess, â€œand let me see the
other side.â€

â€œIf I appear,â€ said Bois-Guilbert, â€œin the fatal lists, thou diest by a
slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty
hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and dishonoured
knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels--the
illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a
hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour, I lose the prospect
of such greatness as scarce emperors attain to--I sacrifice mighty
ambition, I destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which
heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled--and yet, Rebecca,â€ he
added, throwing himself at her feet, â€œthis greatness will I sacrifice,
this fame will I renounce, this power will I forego, even now when it
is half within my grasp, if thou wilt say, Bois-Guilbert, I receive thee
for my lover.â€

â€œThink not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œbut
hasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John--they cannot,
in honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand
Master. So shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part,
or the pretext of requiring any requital from me.â€

â€œWith these I deal not,â€ he continued, holding the train of her
robe--â€œit is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy
choice? Bethink thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is
death who is my rival.â€

â€œI weigh not these evils,â€ said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild
knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even
feign to endure it. â€œBe a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith
recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions
pretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital
which would change thy magnanimity into base barter.â€

â€œNo, damsel!â€ said the proud Templar, springing up, â€œthou shalt not thus
impose on me--if I renounce present fame and future ambition, I renounce
it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me, Rebecca,â€
 he said, again softening his tone; â€œEngland,--Europe,--is not the
world. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even for my
ambition. We will go to Palestine, where Conrade, Marquis of Montserrat,
is my friend--a friend free as myself from the doting scruples which
fetter our free-born reason--rather with Saladin will we league
ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn.--I will
form new paths to greatness,â€ he continued, again traversing the room
with hasty strides--â€œEurope shall hear the loud step of him she has
driven from her sons!--Not the millions whom her crusaders send to
slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine--not the sabres of the
thousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way so deep into
that land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of
me and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere
to me in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen, Rebecca--on Mount Carmel
shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and I will
exchange my long-desired batoon for a sceptre!â€

â€œA dream,â€ said Rebecca; â€œan empty vision of the night, which, were it
a waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which thou
mightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or
religious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties,
and cast away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member,
in order to gratify an unruly passion for the daughter of another
people.--Put not a price on my deliverance, Sir Knight--sell not a deed
of generosity--protect the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not
for a selfish advantage--Go to the throne of England; Richard will
listen to my appeal from these cruel men.â€

â€œNever, Rebecca!â€ said the Templar, fiercely. â€œIf I renounce my Order,
for thee alone will I renounce it--Ambition shall remain mine, if thou
refuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.--Stoop my crest to
Richard?--ask a boon of that heart of pride?--Never, Rebecca, will I
place the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake
the Order, I never will degrade or betray it.â€

â€œNow God be gracious to me,â€ said Rebecca, â€œfor the succour of man is
well-nigh hopeless!â€

â€œIt is indeed,â€ said the Templar; â€œfor, proud as thou art, thou hast in
me found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest, think
not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength;
and think then upon thine own fate--to die the dreadful death of the
worst of criminals--to be consumed upon a blazing pile--dispersed to the
elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed--not a
relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived
and moved!--Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect--thou
wilt yield to my suit.â€

â€œBois-Guilbert,â€ answered the Jewess, â€œthou knowest not the heart
of woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best
feelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles
hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown
by woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a
woman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient
of pain--yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to
suffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that my courage shall
mount higher than thine. Farewell--I waste no more words on thee; the
time that remains on earth to the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise
spent--she must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his
people, but who ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in
sincerity and in truth.â€

â€œWe part then thus?â€ said the Templar, after a short pause; â€œwould to
Heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth and
Christian in faith!--Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think when
and how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine own
degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of
spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my look
only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor--this could I wish,
Rebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share I
must have in thy death.â€

â€œThou hast spoken the Jew,â€ said Rebecca, â€œas the persecution of such
as thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his country,
but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence,
which oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history of the
people of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought such
marvels among the nations, were then a people of misers and of
usurers!--And know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which
your boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the
cedar--names that ascend far back to those high times when the Divine
Presence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive
their splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful Voice, which
bade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the Vision--Such
were the princes of the House of Jacob.â€

Rebeccaâ€™s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race,
but faded as she added, with at sigh, â€œSuch WERE the princes of Judah,
now such no more!--They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and
mixed with the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who
shame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac
the son of Adonikam! Farewell!--I envy not thy blood-won honours--I envy
not thy barbarous descent from northern heathens--I envy thee not thy
faith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy
practice.â€

â€œThere is a spell on me, by Heaven!â€ said Bois-Guilbert. â€œI almost think
yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with which
I part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.--Fair
creature!â€ he said, approaching near her, but with great respect,--â€œso
young, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and
with infamy and agony. Who would not weep for thee?--The tear, that has
been a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I
gaze on thee. But it must be--nothing may now save thy life. Thou and
I are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that
hurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which
are dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let
us part, at least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in
vain, and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.â€

â€œThus,â€ said Rebecca, â€œdo men throw on fate the issue of their own wild
passions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the author of my
early death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind;
but it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and
conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.â€

â€œYes,â€ said the Templar, â€œI am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me,
untaught, untamed--and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and
crafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me
above them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high
in my views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I
remain--proud, inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall
have proof.--But thou forgivest me, Rebecca?â€

â€œAs freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.â€

â€œFarewell, then,â€ said the Templar, and left the apartment.

The Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the
return of Bois-Guilbert.

â€œThou hast tarried long,â€ he said; â€œI have been as if stretched on
red-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or his spy
Conrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.--But what
ails thee, brother?--Thy step totters, thy brow is as black as night.
Art thou well, Bois-Guilbert?â€

â€œAy,â€ answered the Templar, â€œas well as the wretch who is doomed to die
within an hour.--Nay, by the rood, not half so well--for there be those
in such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By Heaven,
Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me. I am half resolved to
go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth, and refuse
to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me.â€

â€œThou art mad,â€ answered Malvoisin; â€œthou mayst thus indeed utterly ruin
thyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life of
this Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will
name another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the
accused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty imposed
on thee.â€

â€œâ€˜Tis false--I will myself take arms in her behalf,â€ answered the
Templar, haughtily; â€œand, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, that thou
knowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point
of my lance.â€

â€œAy, but thou forgettest,â€ said the wily adviser, â€œthou wilt have
neither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to Lucas
Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and see
how long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom.
The words shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an
hundred feet under ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide
trial as a recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy
possession, thou wilt be enjoying straw, darkness, and chains, in some
distant convent cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy
water, to expel the foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee.
Thou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.â€

â€œI will break forth and fly,â€ said Bois-Guilbert--â€œfly to some distant
land, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way. No
drop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by my
sanction.â€

â€œThou canst not fly,â€ said the Preceptor; â€œthy ravings have excited
suspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go
and make the essay--present thyself before the gate, and command the
bridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.--Thou are
surprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou
to fly, what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of
thine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?--Think on it. Where
shall thine old companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de
Bois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant,
amid the hisses of the assembled people? What grief will be at the Court
of France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news, that
the knight that set him hard in Palestine, and well-nigh darkened his
renown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could not
even save by so costly a sacrifice!â€

â€œMalvoisin,â€ said the Knight, â€œI thank thee--thou hast touched the
string at which my heart most readily thrills!--Come of it what may,
recreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to
God, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear in
these lists! But they will be empty--no one will risk to break a lance
for the innocent, the forlorn.â€

â€œThe better for thee, if it prove so,â€ said the Preceptor; â€œif no
champion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall
die, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame,
and who will count that blame for praise and commendation.â€

â€œTrue,â€ said Bois-Guilbert; â€œif no champion appears, I am but a part
of the pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no
part in what is to follow.â€

â€œNone whatever,â€ said Malvoisin; â€œno more than the armed image of Saint
George when it makes part of a procession.â€

â€œWell, I will resume my resolution,â€ replied the haughty Templar. â€œShe
has despised me--repulsed me--reviled me--And wherefore should I offer
up for her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others?
Malvoisin, I will appear in the lists.â€

He left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the
Preceptor followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in
Bois-Guilbertâ€™s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much
advantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to
mention the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on
condition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca.
Yet although, in combating his friendâ€™s better feelings, he possessed
all the advantage which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over
a man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all
Malvoisinâ€™s art to keep Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had
prevailed on him to adopt. He was obliged to watch him closely
to prevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to intercept his
communication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an open
rupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various
arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as
champion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating or
ensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which he
could save himself from degradation and disgrace.




CHAPTER XL

     Shadows avaunt!--Richardâ€™s himself again.
     Richard III

When the Black Knight--for it becomes necessary to resume the train of
his adventures--left the Trysting-tree of the generous Outlaw, he held
his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent
and revenue, called the Priory of Saint Botolph, to which the wounded
Ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance
of the faithful Gurth, and the magnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at
present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt Wilfred
and his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave
communication, messengers were dispatched by the Prior in several
directions, and that on the succeeding morning the Black Knight was
about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who
attended as his guide.

â€œWe will meet,â€ he said to Ivanhoe, â€œat Coningsburgh, the castle of the
deceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds the funeral
feast for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together,
Sir Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.
Thou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy
father.â€

So saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed an
anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the Black Knight would
not listen to the proposal.

â€œRest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the
next. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, who can play priest
or fool as I shall be most in the humour.â€

â€œAnd I,â€ said Wamba, â€œwill attend you with all my heart. I would fain
see the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be not full
and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and
cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, Sir Knight, I
will trust your valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in
case mine own wit should fail.â€

â€œAnd how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit
halts?--resolve me that.â€

â€œWit, Sir Knight,â€ replied the Jester, â€œmay do much. He is a quick,
apprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, and knows how
to keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is a
sturdy fellow, that makes all split. He rows against both wind and tide,
and makes way notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight, while I
take advantage of the fair weather in our noble masterâ€™s temper, I will
expect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough.â€

â€œSir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be
distinguished,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œI fear me you have chosen a talkative and
a troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and alley
in the woods as well as eâ€™er a hunter who frequents them; and the poor
knave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.â€

â€œNay,â€ said the Knight, â€œan he have the gift of showing my road, I shall
not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.--Fare
thee well, kind Wilfred--I charge thee not to attempt to travel till
to-morrow at earliest.â€

So saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips,
took leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with Wamba for
his companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were
lost in the shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into the
convent.

But shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old man
came in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his health.

â€œIt is better,â€ he said, â€œthan my fondest hope could have anticipated;
either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to
suppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel
already as if I could bear my corslet; and so much the better, for
thoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here longer
in inactivity.â€

â€œNow, the saints forbid,â€ said the Prior, â€œthat the son of the Saxon
Cedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! It were
shame to our profession were we to suffer it.â€

â€œNor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable father,â€
 said Ivanhoe, â€œdid I not feel myself able to endure the journey, and
compelled to undertake it.â€

â€œAnd what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?â€ said the Prior.

â€œHave you never, holy father,â€ answered the Knight, â€œfelt an
apprehension of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted to
assign a cause?--Have you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny
landscape, by the sudden cloud, which augurs a coming tempest?--And
thinkest thou not that such impulses are deserving of attention, as
being the hints of our guardian spirits, that danger is impending?â€

â€œI may not deny,â€ said the Prior, crossing himself, â€œthat such things
have been, and have been of Heaven; but then such communications have
had a visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art,
what avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst
not aid, were he to be assaulted?â€

â€œPrior,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œthou dost mistake--I am stout enough to exchange
buffets with any who will challenge me to such a traffic--But were it
otherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by other means than by
force of arms? It is but too well known that the Saxons love not the
Norman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon
them when their hearts are irritated by the death of Athelstane,
and their heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge
themselves? I hold his entrance among them at such a moment most
perilous, and I am resolved to share or avert the danger; which, that I
may the better do, I would crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose
pace may be softer than that of my â€˜destrierâ€™.â€ [56]

â€œSurely,â€ said the worthy churchman; â€œyou shall have mine own ambling
jennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the Abbot
of Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call her, that
unless you were to borrow a ride on the jugglerâ€™s steed that paces a
hornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a creature so
gentle and smooth-paced. I have composed many a homily on her back, to
the edification of my brethren of the convent, and many poor Christian
souls.â€

â€œI pray you, reverend father,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œlet Malkin be got ready
instantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.â€

â€œNay, but fair sir,â€ said the Prior, â€œI pray you to remember that Malkin
hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrant not her
enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I
promise you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue
weight--I did but borrow the â€˜Fructus Temporumâ€™ from the priest of Saint
Bees, and I promise you she would not stir from the gate until I had
exchanged the huge volume for my little breviary.â€

â€œTrust me, holy father,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œI will not distress her with too
much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she has
the worst.â€

This reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knightâ€™s heels a
pair of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse that
his best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.

The deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoeâ€™s heels were now
armed, began to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, and
ejaculate,--â€œNay, but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth not
the spur--Better it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple
down at the Grange, which may be had in little more than an hour, and
cannot but be tractable, in respect that she draweth much of our winter
fire-wood, and eateth no corn.â€

â€œI thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as
I see Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carry mine
armour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload
Malkinâ€™s back, she shall not overcome my patience. And now, farewell!â€

Ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his
wound promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the
importunity of the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his
age and fatness would permit, now singing the praises of Malkin, now
recommending caution to the Knight in managing her.

â€œShe is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,â€ said
the old man, laughing at his own jest, â€œbeing barely in her fifteenth
year.â€

Ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfreyâ€™s
paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Priorâ€™s grave advices
and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his
squire (for such Gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he
followed the track of the Black Knight into the forest, while the
Prior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him, and
ejaculating,--â€œSaint Mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war!
I would I had not trusted Malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as I
am with the cold rheum, I am undone if aught but good befalls her. And
yet,â€ said he, recollecting himself, â€œas I would not spare my own old
and disabled limbs in the good cause of Old England, so Malkin must eâ€™en
run her hazard on the same venture; and it may be they will think our
poor house worthy of some munificent guerdon--or, it may be, they will
send the old Prior a pacing nag. And if they do none of these, as great
men will forget little menâ€™s service, truly I shall hold me well repaid
in having done that which is right. And it is now well-nigh the fitting
time to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectory--Ah! I doubt
they obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and matins.â€

So the Prior of Saint Botolphâ€™s hobbled back again into the refectory,
to preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for
the friarsâ€™ breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the table,
and many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to the
convent, and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at another
season, would have attracted observation. But as the stockfish was
highly salted, and the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the brethren
were too anxiously employed to admit of their making much use of their
ears; nor do we read of any of the fraternity, who was tempted to
speculate upon the mysterious hints of their Superior, except Father
Diggory, who was severely afflicted by the toothache, so that he could
only eat on one side of his jaws.

In the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their
leisure through the recesses of the forest; the good Knight whiles
humming to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes
encouraging by questions the prating disposition of his attendant, so
that their dialogue formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest, of
which we would fain give our readers some idea. You are then to imagine
this Knight, such as we have already described him, strong of person,
tall, broad-shouldered, and large of bone, mounted on his mighty black
charger, which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight, so easily he
paced forward under it, having the visor of his helmet raised, in order
to admit freedom of breath, yet keeping the beaver, or under part,
closed, so that his features could be but imperfectly distinguished. But
his ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could be plainly seen, and the large and
bright blue eyes, that flashed from under the dark shade of the raised
visor; and the whole gesture and look of the champion expressed careless
gaiety and fearless confidence--a mind which was unapt to apprehend
danger, and prompt to defy it when most imminent--yet with whom danger
was a familiar thought, as with one whose trade was war and adventure.

The Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led
him to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with
a targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding
his profession, shown himself a skilful master during the storming of
Torquilstone. Indeed, the infirmity of Wambaâ€™s brain consisted chiefly
in a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him not long to
remain quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas,
although he was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any
immediate task, or in apprehending any immediate topic. On horseback,
therefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards,
now on the horseâ€™s ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,--now
hanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting with his face to the
tail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until his
palfrey took his freaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his
length on the green grass--an incident which greatly amused the Knight,
but compelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter.

At the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous pair
were engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in which the clown
bore a mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the Fetterlock.
And thus run the ditty:--

     Anna-Marie, love, up is the sun,
     Anna-Marie, love, morn is begun,
     Mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,
     Up in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.
     Anna-Marie, love, up in the morn,
     The hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,
     The echo rings merry from rock and from tree,
     â€˜Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.

Wamba.

     O Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,
     Around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,
     For what are the joys that in waking we prove,
     Compared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?
     Let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,
     Let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,
     Softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,--
     But think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.

â€œA dainty song,â€ said Wamba, when they had finished their carol, â€œand I
swear by my bauble, a pretty moral!--I used to sing it with Gurth, once
my playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less than
a freemen; and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced by the
melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty
betwixt sleeping and waking--my bones ache at thinking of the tune ever
since. Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to please
you, fair sir.â€

The Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to
which the Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.

Knight and Wamba.

     There came three merry men from south, west, and north,
     Ever more sing the roundelay;
     To win the Widow of Wycombe forth,
     And where was the widow might say them nay?

     The first was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,
     Ever more sing the roundelay;
     And his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,
     And where was the widow might say him nay?

     Of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,
     He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;
     She bade him go bask by his sea-coal fire,
     For she was the widow would say him nay.

Wamba.

     The next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,
     Merrily sing the roundelay;
     Hurâ€™s a gentleman, God wot, and hurâ€™s lineage was of Wales,
     And where was the widow might say him nay?

     Sir David ap Morgan ap Griffith ap Hugh
     Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelay
     She said that one widow for so many was too few,
     And she bade the Welshman wend his way.

     But then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,
     Jollily singing his roundelay;
     He spoke to the widow of living and rent,
     And where was the widow could say him nay?

Both.

     So the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,
     There for to sing their roundelay;
     For a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,
     There never was a widow could say him nay.

â€œI would, Wamba,â€ said the knight, â€œthat our host of the Trysting-tree,
or the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise of our
bluff yeoman.â€

â€œSo would not I,â€ said Wamba--â€œbut for the horn that hangs at your
baldric.â€

â€œAy,â€ said the Knight,--â€œthis is a pledge of Locksleyâ€™s goodwill, though
I am not like to need it. Three mots on this bugle will, I am assured,
bring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.â€

â€œI would say, Heaven forefend,â€ said the Jester, â€œwere it not that that
fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.â€

â€œWhy, what meanest thou?â€ said the Knight; â€œthinkest thou that but for
this pledge of fellowship they would assault us?â€

â€œNay, for me I say nothing,â€ said Wamba; â€œfor green trees have ears as
well as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, Sir Knight--When
is thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?â€

â€œWhy, never, I think,â€ replied the Knight.

â€œThou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an
answer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a Saxon,
and leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.â€

â€œYou hold our friends for robbers, then?â€ said the Knight of the
Fetterlock.

â€œYou hear me not say so, fair sir,â€ said Wamba; â€œit may relieve a manâ€™s
steed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to make; and,
certes, it may do good to the riderâ€™s soul to ease him of that which is
the root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names to those who do
such services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my
chamber, when I meet with these good fellows, because it might save them
some trouble.â€

â€œWE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair
character thou dost afford them.â€

â€œPray for them with all my heart,â€ said Wamba; â€œbut in the town, not
in the greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom they caused to say
mass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.â€

â€œSay as thou list, Wamba,â€ replied the Knight, â€œthese yeomen did thy
master Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.â€

â€œAy, truly,â€ answered Wamba; â€œbut that was in the fashion of their trade
with Heaven.â€

â€œTheir trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?â€ replied his companion.

â€œMarry, thus,â€ said the Jester. â€œThey make up a balanced account with
Heaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as Isaac
the Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little,
and take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on their own
behalf the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to
charitable loans.â€

â€œGive me an example of your meaning, Wamba,--I know nothing of ciphers
or rates of usage,â€ answered the Knight.

â€œWhy,â€ said Wamba, â€œan your valour be so dull, you will please to learn
that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so
laudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants
taken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the
relief of a poor widow.â€

â€œWhich of these was the good deed, which was the felony?â€ interrupted
the Knight.

â€œA good gibe! a good gibe!â€ said Wamba; â€œkeeping witty company
sharpeneth the apprehension. You said nothing so well, Sir Knight, I
will be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.--But
to go on. The merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage
with the burning of a castle,--the thatching of a choir against the
robbing of a church,--the setting free a poor prisoner against the
murder of a proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the
deliverance of a Saxon franklin against the burning alive of a Norman
baron. Gentle thieves they are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it
is ever the luckiest to meet with them when they are at the worst.â€

â€œHow so, Wamba?â€ said the Knight.

â€œWhy, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters
with Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance, Heaven help them
with whom they next open the account! The travellers who first met
them after their good service at Torquilstone would have a woeful
flaying.--And yet,â€ said Wamba, coming close up to the Knightâ€™s side,
â€œthere be companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet
than yonder outlaws.â€

â€œAnd who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I trow?â€
 said the Knight.

â€œMarry, sir, but we have Malvoisinâ€™s men-at-arms,â€ said Wamba; â€œand let
me tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of these is worth
a band of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their harvest,
and are reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from Torquilstone.
So that, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our
feats of arms.--Now, I pray you, Sir Knight, what would you do if we met
two of them?â€

â€œPin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us
any impediment.â€

â€œBut what if there were four of them?â€

â€œThey should drink of the same cup,â€ answered the Knight.

â€œWhat if six,â€ continued Wamba, â€œand we as we now are, barely two--would
you not remember Locksleyâ€™s horn?â€

â€œWhat! sound for aid,â€ exclaimed the Knight, â€œagainst a score of such
â€˜rascailleâ€™ as these, whom one good knight could drive before him, as
the wind drives the withered leaves?â€

â€œNay, then,â€ said Wamba, â€œI will pray you for a close sight of that same
horn that hath so powerful a breath.â€

The Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his
fellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.

â€œTra-lira-la,â€ said he, whistling the notes; â€œnay, I know my gamut as
well as another.â€

â€œHow mean you, knave?â€ said the Knight; â€œrestore me the bugle.â€

â€œContent you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly
travel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.â€

â€œNay but, rogue,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œthis exceedeth thy
license--Beware ye tamper not with my patience.â€

â€œUrge me not with violence, Sir Knight,â€ said the Jester, keeping at a
distance from the impatient champion, â€œor Folly will show a clean pair
of heels, and leave Valour to find out his way through the wood as best
he may.â€

â€œNay, thou hast hit me there,â€ said the Knight; â€œand, sooth to say, I
have little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt, but
let us proceed on our journey.â€

â€œYou will not harm me, then?â€ said Wamba.

â€œI tell thee no, thou knave!â€

â€œAy, but pledge me your knightly word for it,â€ continued Wamba, as he
approached with great caution.

â€œMy knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.â€

â€œNay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,â€ said the
Jester, coming up frankly to the Knightâ€™s side; â€œbut, in truth, I love
not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his
holiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. And now that
Folly wears the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane;
for, if I mistake not, there are company in yonder brake that are on the
look-out for us.â€

â€œWhat makes thee judge so?â€ said the Knight.

â€œBecause I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from
amongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they had kept the
path. But yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint
Nicholas.â€

â€œBy my faith,â€ said the Knight, closing his visor, â€œI think thou beâ€™st
in the right onâ€™t.â€

And in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same
instant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of
which would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside
by the steel visor. The other two were averted by the gorget, and by the
shield which hung around his neck.

â€œThanks, trusty armourers,â€ said the Knight.--â€œWamba, let us close with
them,â€--and he rode straight to the thicket. He was met by six or seven
men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career. Three
of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as little effect
as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The Black Knightâ€™s
eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his visor. He
raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity, and
exclaimed, â€œWhat means this, my masters!â€--The men made no other reply
than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side, crying,
â€œDie, tyrant!â€

â€œHa! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!â€ said the Black Knight, striking
down a man at every invocation; â€œhave we traitors here?â€

His opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which
carried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his
single strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a
knight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other
assailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the
rider but at the steed, wounded the noble animal mortally.

â€œThat was a felon stroke!â€ exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed fell
to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.

And at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so
speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. The sudden sound made
the murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly
weaponed, did not hesitate to rush in and assist the Black Knight to
rise.

â€œShame on ye, false cowards!â€ exclaimed he in the blue harness, who
seemed to lead the assailants, â€œdo ye fly from the empty blast of a horn
blown by a Jester?â€

Animated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best
refuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with
his sword. The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the
moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped
against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when
his purpose was again intercepted by Wamba. The Jester, making up by
agility the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who
were busied in their more important object, hovered on the skirts of the
fight, and effectually checked the fatal career of the Blue Knight, by
hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword. Horse and man went to
the ground; yet the situation of the Knight of the Fetterlock continued
very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely
armed, and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary
to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when
a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most
formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the
glade, headed by Locksley and the jovial Friar, who, taking ready and
effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom
lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. The Black Knight thanked his
deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,
which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a
person of exalted rank.

â€œIt concerns me much,â€ he said, â€œeven before I express my full gratitude
to my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have been my unprovoked
enemies.--Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who seems the chief
of these villains.â€

The Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who,
bruised by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay
incapable either of flight or resistance.

â€œCome, valiant sir,â€ said Wamba, â€œI must be your armourer as well as
your equerry--I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelm you.â€

So saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue
Knight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the
Knight of the Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not
expect to have seen under such circumstances.

â€œWaldemar Fitzurse!â€ he said in astonishment; â€œwhat could urge one of
thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?â€

â€œRichard,â€ said the captive Knight, looking up to him, â€œthou knowest
little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can
lead every child of Adam.â€

â€œRevenge?â€ answered the Black Knight; â€œI never wronged thee--On me thou
hast nought to revenge.â€

â€œMy daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn--was that no
injury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?â€

â€œThy daughter?â€ replied the Black Knight; â€œa proper cause of enmity, and
followed up to a bloody issue!--Stand back, my masters, I would speak
to him alone.--And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the truth--confess who
set thee on this traitorous deed.â€

â€œThy fatherâ€™s son,â€ answered Waldemar, â€œwho, in so doing, did but avenge
on thee thy disobedience to thy father.â€

Richardâ€™s eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame
it. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an instant gazing
on the face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending
with shame.

â€œThou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,â€ said the King.

â€œHe that is in the lionâ€™s clutch,â€ answered Fitzurse, â€œknows it were
needless.â€

â€œTake it, then, unasked,â€ said Richard; â€œthe lion preys not on prostrate
carcasses.--Take thy life, but with this condition, that in three days
thou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy Norman
castle, and that thou wilt never mention the name of John of Anjou as
connected with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground after the
space I have allotted thee, thou diest--or if thou breathest aught
that can attaint the honour of my house, by Saint George! not the altar
itself shall be a sanctuary. I will hang thee out to feed the ravens,
from the very pinnacle of thine own castle.--Let this knight have a
steed, Locksley, for I see your yeomen have caught those which were
running loose, and let him depart unharmed.â€

â€œBut that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be
disputed,â€ answered the yeoman, â€œI would send a shaft after the skulking
villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.â€

â€œThou bearest an English heart, Locksley,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œand
well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest--I am Richard
of England!â€

At these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank,
and no less distinguished character of Coeur-de-Lion, the yeomen at once
kneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance,
and implored pardon for their offences.

â€œRise, my friends,â€ said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on
them with a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already
conquered the blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no
mark of the late desperate conflict, excepting the flush arising from
exertion,--â€œArise,â€ he said, â€œmy friends!--Your misdemeanours, whether
in forest or field, have been atoned by the loyal services you rendered
my distressed subjects before the walls of Torquilstone, and the rescue
you have this day afforded to your sovereign. Arise, my liegemen, and be
good subjects in future.--And thou, brave Locksley--â€

â€œCall me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name,
which, I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your
royal ears--I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.â€ [561]

â€œKing of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!â€ said the King, â€œwho
hath not heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine? But be
assured, brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the
turbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy
disadvantage.â€

â€œTrue says the proverb,â€ said Wamba, interposing his word, but with some
abatement of his usual petulance,--

â€œâ€˜When the cat is away, The mice will play.â€™â€

â€œWhat, Wamba, art thou there?â€ said Richard; â€œI have been so long of
hearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken flight.â€

â€œI take flight!â€ said Wamba; â€œwhen do you ever find Folly separated from
Valour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey gelding, whom
I heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay there
houghed in his place. It is true, I gave a little ground at first, for
a motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel doublet will. But
if I fought not at swordâ€™s point, you will grant me that I sounded the
onset.â€

â€œAnd to good purpose, honest Wamba,â€ replied the King. â€œThy good service
shall not be forgotten.â€

â€œâ€˜Confiteor! Confiteor!â€™â€--exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice near
the Kingâ€™s side--â€œmy Latin will carry me no farther--but I confess my
deadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before I am led to
execution!â€

Richard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees, telling
his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the
skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was gathered so
as he thought might best express the most profound contrition, his
eyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as Wamba
expressed it, like the tassels at the mouth of a purse. Yet this demure
affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous
meaning which lurked in his huge features, and seemed to pronounce his
fear and repentance alike hypocritical.

â€œFor what art thou cast down, mad Priest?â€ said Richard; â€œart thou
afraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve Our Lady and
Saint Dunstan?--Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no
secrets that pass over the flagon.â€

â€œNay, most gracious sovereign,â€ answered the Hermit, (well known to the
curious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name of Friar
Tuck,) â€œit is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.--Alas! that my
sacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the Lordâ€™s
anointed!â€

â€œHa! ha!â€ said Richard, â€œsits the wind there?--In truth I had forgotten
the buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. But if the
cuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if it
was not as well repaid--or, if thou thinkest I still owe thee aught, and
will stand forth for another counterbuff--â€

â€œBy no means,â€ replied Friar Tuck, â€œI had mine own returned, and with
usury--may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!â€

â€œIf I could do so with cuffs,â€ said the King, â€œmy creditors should have
little reason to complain of an empty exchequer.â€

â€œAnd yet,â€ said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical countenance,
â€œI know not what penance I ought to perform for that most sacrilegious
blow!---â€

â€œSpeak no more of it, brother,â€ said the King; â€œafter having stood
so many cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void of reason to
quarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet,
mine honest Friar, I think it would be best both for the church and
thyself, that I should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain
thee as a yeoman of our guard, serving in care of our person, as
formerly in attendance upon the altar of Saint Dunstan.â€

â€œMy Liege,â€ said the Friar, â€œI humbly crave your pardon; and you would
readily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin of laziness has
beset me. Saint Dunstan--may he be gracious to us!--stands quiet in his
niche, though I should forget my orisons in killing a fat buck--I stay
out of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what--Saint Dunstan
never complains--a quiet master he is, and a peaceful, as ever was made
of wood.--But to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the King--the
honour is great, doubtless--yet, if I were but to step aside to comfort
a widow in one corner, or to kill a deer in another, it would be, â€˜where
is the dog Priest?â€™ says one. â€˜Who has seen the accursed Tuck?â€™ says
another. â€˜The unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half the
country besides,â€™ says one keeper; â€˜And is hunting after every shy doe
in the country!â€™ quoth a second.--In fine, good my Liege, I pray you
to leave me as you found me; or, if in aught you desire to extend your
benevolence to me, that I may be considered as the poor Clerk of Saint
Dunstanâ€™s cell in Copmanhurst, to whom any small donation will be most
thankfully acceptable.â€

â€œI understand thee,â€ said the King, â€œand the Holy Clerk shall have a
grant of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark, however, I
will but assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove
an apology for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christian knight nor true
king.â€

â€œYour Grace may be well assured,â€ said the Friar, â€œthat, with the
grace of Saint Dunstan, I shall find the way of multiplying your most
bounteous gift.â€

â€œI nothing doubt it, good brother,â€ said the King; â€œand as venison is
but dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a butt
of sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the first
strike, yearly--If that will not quench thy thirst, thou must come to
court, and become acquainted with my butler.â€

â€œBut for Saint Dunstan?â€ said the Friar--

â€œA cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,â€ continued
the King, crossing himself--â€œBut we may not turn our game into earnest,
lest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour
and worship.â€

â€œI will answer for my patron,â€ said the Priest, joyously.

â€œAnswer for thyself, Friar,â€ said King Richard, something sternly; but
immediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter, somewhat
abashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. â€œThou dost less honour to my
extended palm than to my clenched fist,â€ said the Monarch; â€œthou didst
only kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.â€

But the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing
the conversation in too jocose a style--a false step to be particularly
guarded against by those who converse with monarchs--bowed profoundly,
and fell into the rear.

At the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.




CHAPTER XLI

     All hail to the lordlings of high degree,
     Who live not more happy, though greater than we!
     Our pastimes to see,
     Under every green tree,
     In all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be.
     Macdonald

The new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolphâ€™s
palfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knightâ€™s own war-horse.
The astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master
besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in
the little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less
surprised to see Richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the
outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue
therefore for a prince. He hesitated whether to address the King as the
Black Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards
him. Richard saw his embarrassment.

â€œFear not, Wilfred,â€ he said, â€œto address Richard Plantagenet as
himself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts,
although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm
English blood.â€

â€œSir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,â€ said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward, â€œmy
assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say
somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not truer
subjects than those who now stand around him.â€

â€œI cannot doubt it, brave man,â€ said Wilfred, â€œsince thou art of the
number--But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain men,
and the bloody armour of my Prince?â€

â€œTreason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,â€ said the King; â€œbut, thanks to
these brave men, treason hath met its meed--But, now I bethink me, thou
too art a traitor,â€ said Richard, smiling; â€œa most disobedient traitor;
for were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst repose thyself at
Saint Botolphâ€™s until thy wound was healed?â€

â€œIt is healed,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œit is not of more consequence than the
scratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex
the hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely
journeys and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that
of a mere knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance and
sword may procure him?â€

â€œAnd Richard Plantagenet,â€ said the King, â€œdesires no more fame than his
good lance and sword may acquire him--and Richard Plantagenet is prouder
of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his good arm
to speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred thousand armed
men.â€

â€œBut your kingdom, my Liege,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œyour kingdom is threatened
with dissolution and civil war--your subjects menaced with every species
of evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which
it is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this
moment narrowly escaped.â€

â€œHo! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?â€ answered Richard, impatiently; â€œI
tell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing to repay
my follies in kind--For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of
Ivanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king a
homily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has
most reason to upbraid the other?--Yet forgive me, my faithful Wilfred.
The time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I
explained to thee at Saint Botolphâ€™s, necessary to give my friends
and faithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richardâ€™s
return is announced, he should be at the head of such a force as enemies
shall tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason, without
even unsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be strong
enough to move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must have news
of Salisbury from the south; and of Beauchamp, in Warwickshire; and of
Multon and Percy in the north. The Chancellor must make sure of London.
Too sudden an appearance would subject me to dangers, other than
my lance and sword, though backed by the bow of bold Robin, or the
quarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the sage Wamba, may be able
to rescue me from.â€

Wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend
with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master
upon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it
was unpardonable in him to have sought out. The young knight sighed,
therefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having
silenced his counsellor, though his heart acknowledged the justice of
the charge he had brought against him, went on in conversation with
Robin Hood.--â€œKing of Outlaws,â€ he said, â€œhave you no refreshment to
offer to your brother sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me
both in exercise and appetite.â€

â€œIn troth,â€ replied the Outlaw, â€œfor I scorn to lie to your Grace,
our larder is chiefly supplied with--â€ He stopped, and was somewhat
embarrassed.

â€œWith venison, I suppose?â€ said Richard, gaily; â€œbetter food at need
there can be none--and truly, if a king will not remain at home and
slay his own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it
killed to his hand.â€

â€œIf your Grace, then,â€ said Robin, â€œwill again honour with your presence
one of Robin Hoodâ€™s places of rendezvous, the venison shall not be
lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably good
wine, to relish it withal.â€

The Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch,
more happy, probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his
foresters, than he would have been in again assuming his royal state,
and presiding over a splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in
society and adventure were the zest of life to Richard Coeur-de-Lion,
and it had its highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered
and surmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless
character, of a knight of romance, was in a great measure realized and
revived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of
arms, was far more dear to his excited imagination, than that which a
course of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government.
Accordingly, his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid
meteor, which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an
unnecessary and portentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by
universal darkness; his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards
and minstrels, but affording none of those solid benefits to his country
on which history loves to pause, and hold up as an example to posterity.
But in his present company Richard showed to the greatest imaginable
advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of manhood in every rank
of life.

Beneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the
King of England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who
now formed his court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough
foresters soon lost their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song
and the jest were exchanged--the stories of former deeds were told
with advantage; and at length, and while boasting of their successful
infraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in
presence of their natural guardian. The merry King, nothing heeding his
dignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among
the jolly band. The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be
desirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to
disturb its harmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoeâ€™s brow
clouded with anxiety. â€œWe are honoured,â€ he said to Ivanhoe, apart, â€œby
the presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that he dallied
with time, which the circumstances of his kingdom may render precious.â€

â€œIt is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,â€ said Wilfred, apart;
â€œand know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest
mood are but toying with the lionâ€™s whelp, which, on slight provocation,
uses both fangs and claws.â€

â€œYou have touched the very cause of my fear,â€ said the Outlaw; â€œmy
men are rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as
good-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how
warmly it may be received--it is time this revel were broken off.â€

â€œIt must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,â€ said Ivanhoe;
â€œfor each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to
prolong it.â€

â€œMust I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?â€ said Robin
Hood, pausing for all instant; â€œbut by Saint Christopher, it shall be
so. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.--Here,
Scathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a Norman blast on
thy bugle, and without an instantâ€™s delay on peril of your life.â€

Scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the
revellers were startled by the sound of his horn.

â€œIt is the bugle of Malvoisin,â€ said the Miller, starting to his feet,
and seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his
quarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook
himself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.

Men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet
to the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of
pleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his
armour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on,
he laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest
displeasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was
approaching.

â€œThou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,--and I have seen
it. Thou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his
friend and liegeman.â€

In the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in
different directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw
the company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now
completely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his
Sovereign.

â€œFor what, good yeoman?â€ said Richard, somewhat impatiently. â€œHave we
not already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions? Thinkest
thou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between us?
Thou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that time?â€

â€œAy, but I have though,â€ answered the yeoman, â€œif it be an offence to
deceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard
was none of Malvoisinâ€™s, but blown by my direction, to break off the
banquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus
dallied with.â€

He then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a manner
rather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the King,--like
one who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is confident in the
rectitude of his motive. The blood rushed in anger to the countenance
of Richard; but it was the first transient emotion, and his sense of
justice instantly subdued it.

â€œThe King of Sherwood,â€ he said, â€œgrudges his venison and his wine-flask
to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!--but when you come to
see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou art
right, however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and away--Wilfred
has been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast thou never a
friend in thy band, who, not content with advising, will needs direct
thy motions, and look miserable when thou dost presume to act for
thyself?â€

â€œSuch a one,â€ said Robin, â€œis my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even
now absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I
will own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom
of his councils--but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with
one who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his masterâ€™s
service.â€

â€œThou art right, good yeoman,â€ answered Richard; â€œand if I had Ivanhoe,
on the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad
gravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou
thinkest my own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own
will as any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.--But come, sirs, let us
merrily on to Coningsburgh, and think no more onâ€™t.â€

Robin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction of
the road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and apprize
them of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they would
find the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receive such timely notice
of the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong troop of
archers, with which he himself proposed to follow on the same route.

The wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched
Richardâ€™s feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain
on account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him.
He once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full
pardon and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain the
tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws, by
which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion. But
Richardâ€™s good intentions towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated by the
Kingâ€™s untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was extorted
from the unwilling hands of King John when he succeeded to his heroic
brother. As for the rest of Robin Hoodâ€™s career, as well as the tale
of his treacherous death, they are to be found in those black-letter
garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny.

â€œNow cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.â€

The Outlawâ€™s opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe,
Gurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the
Castle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.

There are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are
presented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and
gentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is
richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river,
well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which,
as its Saxon name implies, was, previous to the Conquest, a royal
residence of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably been
added by the Normans, but the inner keep bears token of very great
antiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court,
and forms a complete circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter.
The wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six huge
external buttresses which project from the circle, and rise up against
the sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it. These
massive buttresses are solid when they arise from the foundation, and a
good way higher up; but are hollowed out towards the top, and terminate
in a sort of turrets communicating with the interior of the keep itself.
The distant appearance of this huge building, with these singular
accompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the picturesque, as
the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary, whose imagination
it carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A barrow, in the vicinity
of the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of the memorable Hengist; and
various monuments, of great antiquity and curiosity, are shown in the
neighbouring churchyard. [57]

When Coeur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet
stately building, it was not, as at present, surrounded by external
fortifications. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering
the main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallation than a
rude barrier of palisades.

A huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced
that the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being
solemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceasedâ€™s birth or quality,
for armorial bearings were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry
themselves and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the
gate was another banner, on which the figure of a white horse,
rudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the
well-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.

All around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral
banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only
every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased,
but all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and
consequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be
observed in the fullest extent.

Numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill
on which the castle was situated; and when the King and his attendants
entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space
within presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the
assemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat
sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set abroach, to be drained at
the freedom of all comers. Groups of every description were to be seen
devouring the food and swallowing the liquor thus abandoned to
their discretion. The naked Saxon serf was drowning the sense of
his half-yearâ€™s hunger and thirst, in one day of gluttony and
drunkenness--the more pampered burgess and guild-brother was eating his
morsel with gust, or curiously criticising the quantity of the malt and
the skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman gentry might also
be seen, distinguished by their shaven chins and short cloaks, and not
less so by their keeping together, and looking with great scorn on the
whole solemnity, even while condescending to avail themselves of the
good cheer which was so liberally supplied.

Mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with
strolling soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own
account at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling
mechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers,
hedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering prayers,
and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and rotes. [58]

One sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric;
another, in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh
names of his noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting,
nor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of
their profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons
on these occasions were as natural as they were rude. If sorrow was
thirsty, there was drink--if hungry, there was food--if it sunk down
upon and saddened the heart, here were the means supplied of mirth, or
at least of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves
of those means of consolation, although, every now and then, as if
suddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the men
groaned in unison, while the females, of whom many were present, raised
up their voices and shrieked for very woe.

Such was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was
entered by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned
not to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were perpetually
entering and withdrawing, unless so far as was necessary to preserve
order; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the Monarch and
Ivanhoe, more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were
familiar to him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for such their
dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a Saxon solemnity, and could not
but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. And
in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office,
this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage
of guests, thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe to the entrance of the
tower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard,
nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence
should be required.




CHAPTER XLII

     I found them winding of Marcelloâ€™s corpse.
     And there was such a solemn melody,
     â€˜Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,--
     Such as old grandames, watching by the dead,
     Are wont to outwear the night with.
     --Old Play

The mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very
peculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in
which it was erected. A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be
almost precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side of the
tower, by which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could
a few years since, gain access to a small stair within the thickness
of the main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the
building,--the two lower being dungeons or vaults, which neither receive
air nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with which
they seem to have communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper
apartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given
by stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses.

By this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard,
followed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment
which occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred,
by the difficulties of the ascent, gained time to muffle his face in his
mantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present himself
to his father until the King should give him the signal.

There were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table,
about a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon
families in the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least,
elderly men; for the younger race, to the great displeasure of the
seniors, had, like Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which
separated for half a century the Norman victors from the vanquished
Saxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their
silence and their mournful posture, formed a strong contrast to the
levity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their grey locks
and long full beards, together with their antique tunics and loose black
mantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in which they
were seated, and gave the appearance of a band of ancient worshippers of
Woden, recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their national glory.

Cedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by common
consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of Richard
(only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he arose
gravely, and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, â€œWaes haelâ€,
raising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no stranger
to the customs of his English subjects, returned the greeting with the
appropriate words, â€œDrinc haelâ€, and partook of a cup which was handed
to him by the sewer. The same courtesy was offered to Ivanhoe, who
pledged his father in silence, supplying the usual speech by an
inclination of his head, lest his voice should have been recognised.

When this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and,
extending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude
chapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external
buttresses. As there was no opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole,
the place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or
torches, which showed, by a red and smoky light, the arched roof and
naked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the crucifix of the same
material.

Before this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier
kneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers,
with the greatest signs of external devotion. For this service a
splendid â€œsoul-scatâ€ was paid to the convent of Saint Edmundâ€™s by the
mother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole
brethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to
Coningsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard
in the performance of divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the others
failed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which
went on at the castle. In maintaining this pious watch and ward, the
good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for
an instant, lest Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon, should lay
his clutches on the departed Athelstane. Nor were they less careful to
prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall, which, having been
that used at the funeral of Saint Edmund, was liable to be desecrated,
if handled by the profane. If, in truth, these attentions could be of
any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them at the hands
of the brethren of Saint Edmundâ€™s, since, besides a hundred mancuses
of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of Athelstane had
announced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part
of the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetual prayers for
his soul, and that of her departed husband. Richard and Wilfred followed
the Saxon Cedric into the apartment of death, where, as their guide
pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of Athelstane, they
followed his example in devoutly crossing themselves, and muttering a
brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.

This act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to
follow him, gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and,
after ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a
small oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was about eight feet
square, hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the
wall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to the west, and
widening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun
found its way into its dark recess, and showed a female of a dignified
mien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic
beauty. Her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black cypress,
enhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her light-coloured
and flowing tresses, which time had neither thinned nor mingled with
silver. Her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that is consistent
with resignation. On the stone table before her stood a crucifix
of ivory, beside which was laid a missal, having its pages richly
illuminated, and its boards adorned with clasps of gold, and bosses of
the same precious metal.

â€œNoble Edith,â€ said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if
to give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion,
â€œthese are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And
this, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the
deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.â€

â€œHis bravery has my thanks,â€ returned the lady; â€œalthough it be the
will of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his
courtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to
behold the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour
of sorrow and lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them,
satisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can
yet afford.â€

The guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their
hospitable guide.

Another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size
with that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story
immediately above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened,
proceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music. When they entered,
they found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons and
maidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Four maidens, Rowena leading the
choir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased, of which we have only
been able to decipher two or three stanzas:--

     Dust unto dust,
     To this all must;
     The tenant hath resignâ€™d
     The faded form
     To waste and worm--
     Corruption claims her kind.

     Through paths unknown
     Thy soul hath flown,
     To seek the realms of woe,
     Where fiery pain
     Shall purge the stain
     Of actions done below.

     In that sad place,
     By Maryâ€™s grace,
     Brief may thy dwelling be
     Till prayers and alms,
     And holy psalms,
     Shall set the captive free.

While this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female
choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was
engaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste
could compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of
Athelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from
baskets of flowers placed before them, garlands, which they intended for
the same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if
not marked with deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or a smile
called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might
be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her
mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they
were preparing. Neither was this propensity (if we must needs confess
the truth) at all diminished by the appearance of two strange knights,
which occasioned some looking up, peeping, and whispering. Rowena alone,
too proud to be vain, paid her greeting to her deliverer with a graceful
courtesy. Her demeanour was serious, but not dejected; and it may be
doubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his
fate, did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her
kinsman.

To Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably
clear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so
much deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper
to whisper the explanation--â€œShe was the affianced bride of the noble
Athelstane.â€--It may be doubted whether this communication went a far
way to increase Wilfredâ€™s disposition to sympathize with the mourners of
Coningsburgh.

Having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in
which the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different forms,
Cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them,
for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight
connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those
who were immediately effected by the unhappy event. He assured them of
every accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the Black Knight
took his hand.

â€œI crave to remind you, noble Thane,â€ he said, â€œthat when we last
parted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you,
to grant me a boon.â€

â€œIt is granted ere named, noble Knight,â€ said Cedric; â€œyet, at this sad
moment---â€

â€œOf that also,â€ said the King, â€œI have bethought me--but my time is
brief--neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on
the noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and
hasty opinions.â€

â€œSir Knight of the Fetterlock,â€ said Cedric, colouring, and interrupting
the King in his turn, â€œI trust your boon regards yourself and no other;
for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting
that a stranger should mingle.â€

â€œNor do I wish to mingle,â€ said the King, mildly, â€œunless in so far as
you will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but as
the Black Knight of the Fetterlock--Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.â€

â€œRichard of Anjou!â€ exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost
astonishment.

â€œNo, noble Cedric--Richard of England!--whose deepest interest--whose
deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.--And, how now,
worthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?â€

â€œTo Norman blood,â€ said Cedric, â€œit hath never bended.â€

â€œReserve thine homage then,â€ said the Monarch, â€œuntil I shall prove my
right to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.â€

â€œPrince,â€ answered Cedric, â€œI have ever done justice to thy bravery
and thy worth--Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy
descent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm
of Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the
heir to the monarchy.â€

â€œI will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,â€ said Richard,
calmly; â€œbut I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt
find another to be put into the scale against it.â€

â€œAnd hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?â€ said Cedric--â€œTo
upbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has closed oâ€™er
the last scion of Saxon royalty?â€--His countenance darkened as he
spoke.--â€œIt was boldly--it was rashly done!â€

â€œNot so, by the holy rood!â€ replied the King; â€œit was done in the frank
confidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a shadow
of danger.â€

â€œThou sayest well, Sir King--for King I own thou art, and wilt be,
despite of my feeble opposition.--I dare not take the only mode to
prevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my
reach!â€

â€œAnd now to my boon,â€ said the King, â€œwhich I ask not with one jot
the less confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful
sovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being
held faithless, man-sworn, and â€˜nideringâ€™, [581] to forgive and receive
to thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In this
reconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest--the happiness of my
friend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.â€

â€œAnd this is Wilfred!â€ said Cedric, pointing to his son.

â€œMy father!--my father!â€ said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at Cedricâ€™s
feet, â€œgrant me thy forgiveness!â€

â€œThou hast it, my son,â€ said Cedric, raising him up. â€œThe son of
Hereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to
a Norman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English
ancestry--no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my
decent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself
of English ancestry.--Thou art about to speak,â€ he added, sternly, â€œand
I guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two yearsâ€™ mourning, as
for a betrothed husband--all our Saxon ancestors would disown us were
we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should
have wedded--him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and
ancestry--is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself would burst
his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his
memory.â€

It seemed as if Cedricâ€™s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had
he uttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in
the garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like
something arisen from the dead! [59]

The effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly
appalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would
permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself, gazed
on the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a mouth
which he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself,
repeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred
to his memory, while Richard alternately said, â€œBenediciteâ€, and swore,
â€œMort de ma vie!â€

In the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,
â€œSecure the treacherous monks!â€--others, â€œDown with them into the
dungeon!â€--others, â€œPitch them from the highest battlements!â€

â€œIn the name of God!â€ said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of
his departed friend, â€œif thou art mortal, speak!--if a departed spirit,
say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught that can
set thy spirit at repose.--Living or dead, noble Athelstane, speak to
Cedric!â€

â€œI will,â€ said the spectre, very composedly, â€œwhen I have collected
breath, and when you give me time--Alive, saidst thou?--I am as much
alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which
seem three ages--Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By Heaven, and all
saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong
days, and by Godâ€™s providence it is that I am now here to tell it.â€

â€œWhy, noble Athelstane,â€ said the Black Knight, â€œI myself saw you struck
down by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at Torquilstone,
and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the
teeth.â€

â€œYou thought amiss, Sir Knight,â€ said Athelstane, â€œand Wamba lied. My
teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find--No
thanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that
the blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good
mace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not
valued it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have
spoilt his retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but
unwounded. Others, of both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered
above me, so that I never recovered my senses until I found myself in
a coffin--(an open one, by good luck)--placed before the altar of the
church of Saint Edmundâ€™s. I sneezed repeatedly--groaned--awakened and
would have arisen, when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came
running at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to find
the man alive, whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked
for wine--they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for
I slept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I
found my arms swathed down--my feet tied so fast that mine ankles ache
at the very remembrance--the place was utterly dark--the oubliette, as
I suppose, of their accursed convent, and from the close, stifled,
damp smell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture. I had
strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my dungeon
creaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I
was in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of
the Father Abbot.--Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which
he used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!--the dog has feasted
with me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.â€

â€œHave patience, noble Athelstane,â€ said the King, â€œtake breath--tell
your story at leisure--beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth
listening to as a romance.â€

â€œAy but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!â€
 said Athelstane.--â€œA barley loaf and a pitcher of water--that THEY gave
me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had enriched,
when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of
corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange
for their prayers--the nest of foul ungrateful vipers--barley bread and
ditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them out of
their nest, though I be excommunicated!â€

â€œBut, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,â€ said Cedric, grasping
the hand of his friend, â€œhow didst thou escape this imminent danger--did
their hearts relent?â€

â€œDid their hearts relent!â€ echoed Athelstane.--â€œDo rocks melt with the
sun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the Convent,
which I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast,
when they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the
swarm out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms,
little judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who
were thus famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for
food--no wonder--the gouty Sacristan was even too busy with his own
provender to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step
and a strong flavour of wine and spices about his person. Good cheer had
opened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of wine,
instead of my former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated; when, to
add to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his duty of
turnkey fitly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it fell ajar.
The light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The staple to
which my chains were fixed, was more rusted than I or the villain Abbot
had supposed. Even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps
of that infernal dungeon.â€

â€œTake breath, noble Athelstane,â€ said Richard, â€œand partake of some
refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.â€

â€œPartake!â€ quoth Athelstane; â€œI have been partaking five times
to-day--and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign
to the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of
wine.â€

The guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their
resuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:--He had indeed
now many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith,
having given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within
the Castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the strangerâ€™s apartment
attended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze
into the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up
an erroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more
inaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar
without, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact.
Athelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his
escape:--

â€œFinding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as
well as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might;
and after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of
a jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it
so please ye, was holding a devilâ€™s mass with a huge beetle-browed,
broad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much
more like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the
fashion of my grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made
me more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both
stood aghast; but when I knocked down the Sacristan with my fist,
the other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge
quarter-staff.â€

â€œThis must be our Friar Tuck, for a countâ€™s ransom,â€ said Richard,
looking at Ivanhoe.

â€œHe may be the devil, an he will,â€ said Athelstane. â€œFortunately he
missed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his
heels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by
means of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sextonâ€™s belt;
and I had thoughts of beating out the knaveâ€™s brains with the bunch of
keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which
the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a
brace of hearty kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some baked meat,
and a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable brethren had
been regaling, went to the stable, and found in a private stall mine own
best palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for the holy Father
Abbotâ€™s particular use. Hither I came with all the speed the beast could
compass--man and motherâ€™s son flying before me wherever I came,
taking me for a spectre, the more especially as, to prevent my being
recognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had not gained
admittance into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be the
attendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castle-yard
very merry, considering they are assembled to celebrate their lordâ€™s
funeral--I say the sewer thought I was dressed to bear a part in the
tregetourâ€™s mummery, and so I got admission, and did but disclose myself
to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere I came in quest of you, my
noble friend.â€

â€œAnd you have found me,â€ said Cedric, â€œready to resume our brave
projects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so
auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon race.â€

â€œTalk not to me of delivering any one,â€ said Athelstane; â€œit is well I
am delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain Abbot.
He shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and
stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will
have him craned up from without.â€

â€œBut, my son,â€ said Edith, â€œconsider his sacred office.â€

â€œConsider my three daysâ€™ fast,â€ replied Athelstane; â€œI will have their
blood every one of them. Front-de-Boeuf was burnt alive for a less
matter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much
garlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful
slaves, so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave
me neither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of
Hengist!â€

â€œBut the Pope, my noble friend,â€--said Cedric--

â€œBut the devil, my noble friend,â€--answered Athelstane; â€œthey die, and
no more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the world would go
on without them.â€

â€œFor shame, noble Athelstane,â€ said Cedric; â€œforget such wretches in the
career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman prince,
Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold
undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the Holy
Confessor lives to dispute it.â€

â€œHow!â€ said Athelstane, â€œis this the noble King Richard?â€

â€œIt is Richard Plantagenet himself,â€ said Cedric; â€œyet I need not remind
thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be injured
nor detained prisoner--thou well knowest thy duty to him as his host.â€

â€œAy, by my faith!â€ said Athelstane; â€œand my duty as a subject besides,
for I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.â€

â€œMy son,â€ said Edith, â€œthink on thy royal rights!â€

â€œThink on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!â€ said Cedric.

â€œMother and friend,â€ said Athelstane, â€œa truce to your
upbraidings--bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of
ambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into
it. One half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that
perfidious Abbot Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor to
be trusted. Since these plots were set in agitation, I have had nothing
but hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises, imprisonments
and starvation; besides that they can only end in the murder of some
thousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I will be king in my own domains,
and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the
Abbot.â€

â€œAnd my ward Rowena,â€ said Cedric--â€œI trust you intend not to desert
her?â€

â€œFather Cedric,â€ said Athelstane, â€œbe reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares
not for me--she loves the little finger of my kinsman Wilfredâ€™s glove
better than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it--Nay, blush
not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than
a country franklin--and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for grave-clothes
and a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of merriment--Nay, an thou
wilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better jest--Give me thy hand, or
rather lend it me, for I but ask it in the way of friendship.--Here,
cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I renounce and abjure---Hey!
by Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath vanished!--Yet, unless my eyes
are still dazzled with the fasting I have undergone, I saw him stand
there but even now.â€

All now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished.
It was at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that,
after very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour, and
had left the castle.

â€œFair cousin,â€ said Athelstane to Rowena, â€œcould I think that this
sudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the
weightiest reason, I would myself resume--â€

But he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe
had disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely
embarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the
apartment.

â€œCertainly,â€ quoth Athelstane, â€œwomen are the least to be trusted of all
animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I expected not
thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot--These cursed grave-clothes
have surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.--To you I
turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as a
liege-subject--â€

But King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it
was learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his
presence the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a momentâ€™s
speech with him, had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a
steed, compelled the Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which,
according to Wamba, rendered the old Jewâ€™s neck not worth a pennyâ€™s
purchase.

â€œBy my halidome!â€ said Athelstane, â€œit is certain that Zernebock
hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my
grave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one
I speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!--But it skills not
talking of it. Come, my friends--such of you as are left, follow me to
the banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear--it is, I trust, as yet
tolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon noble;
and should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly off with
the supper?â€




CHAPTER XLIII

     Be Mowbrayâ€™s sins so heavy in his bosom,
     That they may break his foaming courserâ€™s back,
     And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
     A caitiff recreant!
     --Richard II

Our scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of
Templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the
life or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the
whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or
rural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not
peculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of
single combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody
spectacle of brave men falling by each otherâ€™s hands. Even in our own
days, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match,
a riot, or a meeting of radical reformers, collects, at considerable
hazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators, otherwise little
interested, except to see how matters are to be conducted, or whether
the heroes of the day are, in the heroic language of insurgent tailors,
flints or dunghills.

The eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the
gate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing
the procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the
tiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on
a piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been
levelled with care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports.
It occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully
palisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to
be witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied
with galleries and benches for their use.

On the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at
the east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors
and Knights of the Order. Over these floated the sacred standard, called
â€œLe Beau-seantâ€, which was the ensign, as its name was the battle-cry,
of the Templars.

At the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged
around a stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the
victim whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal
circle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung
ready for that purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black
slaves, whose colour and African features, then so little known in
England, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them as on demons employed
about their own diabolical exercises. These men stirred not, excepting
now and then, under the direction of one who seemed their chief, to
shift and replace the ready fuel. They looked not on the multitude. In
fact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of every thing save
the discharge of their own horrible duty.

And when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips,
and showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the
expected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing
that they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had
communed, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her
dreadful punishment. They whispered to each other, and communicated all
the feats which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period,
not failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his due.

â€œHave you not heard, Father Dennet,â€ quoth one boor to another advanced
in years, â€œthat the devil has carried away bodily the great Saxon Thane,
Athelstane of Coningsburgh?â€

â€œAy, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint
Dunstan.â€

â€œHowâ€™s that?â€ said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock
embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a
harp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed
of no vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered
doublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the
â€œwrestâ€, or key, with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a
silver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or
badge of the baron to whose family he belonged, had barely the word
SHERWOOD engraved upon it.--â€œHow mean you by that?â€ said the gay
Minstrel, mingling in the conversation of the peasants; â€œI came to seek
one subject for my rhyme, and, byâ€™r Lady, I were glad to find two.â€

â€œIt is well avouched,â€ said the elder peasant, â€œthat after Athelstane of
Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks--â€

â€œThat is impossible,â€ said the Minstrel; â€œI saw him in life at the
Passage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.â€

â€œDead, however, he was, or else translated,â€ said the younger peasant;
â€œfor I heard the Monks of Saint Edmundâ€™s singing the deathâ€™s hymn for
him; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle
of Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for Mabel
Parkins, who--â€

â€œAy, dead was Athelstane,â€ said the old man, shaking his head, â€œand the
more pity it was, for the old Saxon blood--â€

â€œBut, your story, my masters--your story,â€ said the Minstrel, somewhat
impatiently.

â€œAy, ay--construe us the story,â€ said a burly Friar, who stood beside
them, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a pilgrimâ€™s
staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when occasion
served,--â€œYour story,â€ said the stalwart churchman; â€œburn not daylight
about it--we have short time to spare.â€

â€œAn please your reverence,â€ said Dennet, â€œa drunken priest came to visit
the Sacristan at Saint Edmundâ€™s---â€

â€œIt does not please my reverence,â€ answered the churchman, â€œthat there
should be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that
a layman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the
holy man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot
unsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine--I have felt it
myself.â€

â€œWell, then,â€ answered Father Dennet, â€œa holy brother came to visit the
Sacristan at Saint Edmundâ€™s--a sort of hedge-priest is the visitor,
and kills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the
tinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch
of bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and
a merry, who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a
Cheshire round, with eâ€™er a man in Yorkshire.â€

â€œThat last part of thy speech, Dennet,â€ said the Minstrel, â€œhas saved
thee a rib or twain.â€

â€œTush, man, I fear him not,â€ said Dennet; â€œI am somewhat old and stiff,
but when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster--â€

â€œBut the story--the story, my friend,â€ again said the Minstrel.

â€œWhy, the tale is but this--Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at
Saint Edmundâ€™s.â€

â€œThatâ€™s a lie, and a loud one,â€ said the Friar, â€œfor I saw him borne to
his own Castle of Coningsburgh.â€

â€œNay, then, eâ€™en tell the story yourself, my masters,â€ said Dennet,
turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some
difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of
his comrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.--â€œThese two â€˜soberâ€™
friars,â€ said he at length, â€œsince this reverend man will needs have
them such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not,
for the best part for a summerâ€™s day, when they were aroused by a
deep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased
Athelstane entered the apartment, saying, â€˜Ye evil shep-herds!--â€™â€

â€œIt is false,â€ said the Friar, hastily, â€œhe never spoke a word.â€

â€œSo ho! Friar Tuck,â€ said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the
rustics; â€œwe have started a new hare, I find.â€

â€œI tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,â€ said the Hermit, â€œI saw Athelstane of
Coningsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had his
shroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre--A butt of sack will
not wash it out of my memory.â€

â€œPshaw!â€ answered the Minstrel; â€œthou dost but jest with me!â€

â€œNever believe me,â€ said the Friar, â€œan I fetched not a knock at him
with my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided
through his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!â€

â€œBy Saint Hubert,â€ said the Minstrel, â€œbut it is a wondrous tale, and
fit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, â€˜Sorrow came to the old
Friar.â€™â€

â€œLaugh, if ye list,â€ said Friar Tuck; â€œbut an ye catch me singing
on such a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him
headlong! No, no--I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some
good work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the
like matter of godly service, and therefore am I here.â€

As they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael of
Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some distance
from the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one the sullen
sounds fell successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient space
for each to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again filled
by repetition of the iron knell. These sounds, the signal of the
approaching ceremony, chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled
multitude, whose eyes were now turned to the Preceptory, expecting the
approach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the criminal.

At length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing
the great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by
six trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the
Grand Master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture
was of the simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed
cap-a-pie in bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword,
which were borne by his two esquires behind him. His face, though partly
hidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrel-cap, bore
a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed to
contend with irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not
slept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the
habitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the
Temple. His general appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking at
him with attention, men read that in his dark features, from which they
willingly withdrew their eyes.

On either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin,
who acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes
of peace, the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other
Companions of the Temple, with a long train of esquires and pages clad
in black, aspirants to the honour of being one day Knights of the Order.
After these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot, in the same
sable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form of the
accused, moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the scene of her
fate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance there should
be among them some of those amulets which Satan was supposed to bestow
upon his victims, to deprive them of the power of confession even when
under the torture. A coarse white dress, of the simplest form, had been
substituted for her Oriental garments; yet there was such an exquisite
mixture of courage and resignation in her look, that even in this garb,
and with no other ornament than her long black tresses, each eye wept
that looked upon her, and the most hardened bigot regretted the fate
that had converted a creature so goodly into a vessel of wrath, and a
waged slave of the devil.

A crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the
victim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks
bent upon the ground.

This slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of
which was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around
them from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a
halt. There was then a momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all
his attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted
from their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by
the esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.

The unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the
pile. On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were
making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the
body, she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally
doubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space
of a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to
familiarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally
turned away her head.

Meanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry
of his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank,
a loud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court
were seated for judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the
champion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was
the pledge of battle, at the feet of the Grand Master.

â€œValorous Lord, and reverend Father,â€ said he, â€œhere standeth the good
Knight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the
Temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your
reverenceâ€™s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this
day, to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly
deserved the doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order
of the Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;--here, I
say, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be
your noble and sanctified pleasure.â€

â€œHath he made oath,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œthat his quarrel is just
and honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the â€˜Te igiturâ€™.â€

â€œSir, and most reverend father,â€ answered Malvoisin, readily, â€œour
brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation
in the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise he
ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and
may take no oath.â€

This explanation was satisfactory, to Albertâ€™s great joy; for the wily
knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of
prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the
assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his
doing so.

The Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin,
commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets
then again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed
aloud,--â€œOyez, oyez, oyez.--Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian
de Bois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who
will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to
try by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to
such champion the reverend and valorous Grand Master here present allows
a fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else
appertains to a fair combat.â€ The trumpets again sounded, and there was
a dead pause of many minutes.

â€œNo champion appears for the appellant,â€ said the Grand Master. â€œGo,
herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her
in this her cause.â€ The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was
seated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horseâ€™s head toward that
end of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and
Mont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebeccaâ€™s chair as soon as the herald.

â€œIs this regular, and according to the law of combat?â€ said Malvoisin,
looking to the Grand Master.

â€œAlbert de Malvoisin, it is,â€ answered Beaumanoir; â€œfor in this appeal
to the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having that
communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the
truth of the quarrel.â€

In the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms:--â€œDamsel,
the Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demands of thee, if thou
art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if
thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?â€

â€œSay to the Grand Master,â€ replied Rebecca, â€œthat I maintain my
innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become guilty
of mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as his forms
will permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is in manâ€™s extremity,
will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed,
may His holy will be done!â€ The herald retired to carry this answer to
the Grand Master.

â€œGod forbid,â€ said Lucas Beaumanoir, â€œthat Jew or Pagan should impeach
us of injustice!--Until the shadows be cast from the west to the
eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this
unfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for
death.â€

The herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who
bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards
heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce
promise herself from man. During this awful pause, the voice of
Bois-Guilbert broke upon her ear--it was but a whisper, yet it startled
her more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.

â€œRebecca,â€ said the Templar, â€œdost thou hear me?â€

â€œI have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,â€ said the
unfortunate maiden.

â€œAy, but dost thou understand my words?â€ said the Templar; â€œfor the
sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know on what
ground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.--This
listed space--that chair--these faggots--I know their purpose, and yet
it appears to me like something unreal--the fearful picture of a vision,
which appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my
reason.â€

â€œMy mind and senses keep touch and time,â€ answered Rebecca, â€œand tell
me alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body, and
open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.â€

â€œDreams, Rebecca,--dreams,â€ answered the Templar; â€œidle visions,
rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me, Rebecca,â€
 he said, proceeding with animation; â€œa better chance hast thou for life
and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee behind me
on my steed--on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider.
I won him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond--mount, I say,
behind me--in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind--a new
world of pleasure opens to thee--to me a new career of fame. Let them
speak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert from
their list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood whatever blot
they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.â€

â€œTempter,â€ said Rebecca, â€œbegone!--Not in this last extremity canst thou
move me one hairâ€™s-breadth from my resting place--surrounded as I am by
foes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy--avoid thee, in the
name of God!â€

Albert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their
conference, now advanced to interrupt it.

â€œHath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?â€ he demanded of Bois-Guilbert;
â€œor is she resolute in her denial?â€

â€œShe is indeed resolute,â€ said Bois-Guilbert.

â€œThen,â€ said Malvoisin, â€œmust thou, noble brother, resume thy place
to attend the issue--The shades are changing on the circle of the
dial--Come, brave Bois-Guilbert--come, thou hope of our holy Order, and
soon to be its head.â€

As he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knightâ€™s
bridle, as if to lead him back to his station.

â€œFalse villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?â€ said Sir
Brian, angrily. And shaking off his companionâ€™s grasp, he rode back to
the upper end of the lists.

â€œThere is yet spirit in him,â€ said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet,
â€œwere it well directed--but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever
approaches it.â€

The Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the
appearance of a champion.

â€œAnd reason good,â€ said Friar Tuck, â€œseeing she is a Jewess--and yet,
by mine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should
perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times
a witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my
quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce
Templar, ere he carried the matter off thus.â€

It was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear
for a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by
Malvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the
pledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging his horse
to speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. A
hundred voices exclaimed, â€œA champion! a champion!â€ And despite the
prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously
as the knight rode into the tiltyard. The second glance, however, served
to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited. His horse,
urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared to reel from fatigue,
and the rider, however undauntedly he presented himself in the lists,
either from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed scarce able to support
himself in the saddle.

To the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and
purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, â€œI am a good
knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just
and lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York;
to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and
to defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as
I will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of God,
of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good knight.â€

â€œThe stranger must first show,â€ said Malvoisin, â€œthat he is good knight,
and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her champions
against nameless men.â€

â€œMy name,â€ said the Knight, raising his helmet, â€œis better known, my
lineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.â€

â€œI will not fight with thee at present,â€ said the Templar, in a changed
and hollow voice. â€œGet thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse,
and it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this
boyish spirit of bravado.â€

â€œHa! proud Templar,â€ said Ivanhoe, â€œhast thou forgotten that twice didst
thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre--remember the
Passage of Arms at Ashby--remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of
Rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that
thou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour
thou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I
will proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe--in every
Preceptory of thine Order--unless thou do battle without farther delay.â€

Bois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and
then exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, â€œDog of a Saxon! take thy
lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!â€

â€œDoes the Grand Master allow me the combat?â€ said Ivanhoe.

â€œI may not deny what thou hast challenged,â€ said the Grand Master,
â€œprovided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou
wert in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou ever
been, yet would I have thee honourably met with.â€

â€œThus--thus as I am, and not otherwise,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œit is the
judgment of God--to his keeping I commend myself.--Rebecca,â€ said he,
riding up to the fatal chair, â€œdost thou accept of me for thy champion?â€

â€œI do,â€ she said--â€œI do,â€ fluttered by an emotion which the fear of
death had been unable to produce, â€œI do accept thee as the champion whom
Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no--no--thy wounds are uncured--Meet not that
proud man--why shouldst thou perish also?â€

But Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and
assumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked,
as he clasped his visor, that his face, which had, notwithstanding the
variety of emotions by which he had been agitated, continued during the
whole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much
flushed.

The herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice,
repeating thrice--â€œFaites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!â€ After the
third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed,
that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or
action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. The
Grand Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebeccaâ€™s glove,
now threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words,
â€œLaissez allerâ€.

The trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career.
The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went
down, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous
steed of the Templar. This issue of the combat all had foreseen; but
although the spear of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield
of Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to the astonishment of all who beheld
it reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell in the lists.

Ivanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot,
hastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose
not. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the swordâ€™s point
to his throat, commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot.
Bois-Guilbert returned no answer.

â€œSlay him not, Sir Knight,â€ cried the Grand Master, â€œunshriven and
unabsolved--kill not body and soul! We allow him vanquished.â€

He descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered
champion. His eyes were closed--the dark red flush was still on his
brow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened--but they
were fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to
the pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had
died a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.

â€œThis is indeed the judgment of God,â€ said the Grand Master, looking
upwards--â€œâ€˜Fiat voluntas tua!â€™â€




CHAPTER XLIV

     So! now â€˜tis ended, like an old wifeâ€™s story.
     Webster

When the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe
demanded of the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully
and rightfully done his duty in the combat? â€œManfully and rightfully hath
it been done,â€ said the Grand Master. â€œI pronounce the maiden free and
guiltless--The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the will
of the victor.â€

â€œI will not despoil him of his weapons,â€ said the Knight of Ivanhoe,
â€œnor condemn his corpse to shame--he hath fought for Christendom--Godâ€™s
arm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his
obsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust
quarrel.--And for the maiden--â€

He was interrupted by a clattering of horsesâ€™ feet, advancing in such
numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the
Black Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous band
of men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.

â€œI am too late,â€ he said, looking around him. â€œI had doomed
Bois-Guilbert for mine own property.--Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on
thee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?â€

â€œHeaven, my Liege,â€ answered Ivanhoe, â€œhath taken this proud man for its
victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed.â€

â€œPeace be with him,â€ said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse,
â€œif it may be so--he was a gallant knight, and has died in his steel
harness full knightly. But we must waste no time--Bohun, do thine
office!â€

A Knight stepped forward from the Kingâ€™s attendants, and, laying his
hand on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, â€œI arrest thee of
High Treason.â€

The Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so
many warriors.--He now spoke.

â€œWho dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth
of his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by
whose authority is this bold outrage offered?â€

â€œI make the arrest,â€ replied the Knight--â€œI, Henry Bohun, Earl of Essex,
Lord High Constable of England.â€

â€œAnd he arrests Malvoisin,â€ said the King, raising his visor, â€œby the
order of Richard Plantagenet, here present.--Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it
is well for thee thou art born no subject of mine.--But for thee,
Malvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a week
older.â€

â€œI will resist thy doom,â€ said the Grand Master.

â€œProud Templar,â€ said the King, â€œthou canst not--look up, and behold the
Royal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of thy Temple
banner!--Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition--Thy hand
is in the lionâ€™s mouth.â€

â€œI will appeal to Rome against thee,â€ said the Grand Master, â€œfor
usurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ said the King; â€œbut for thine own sake tax me not with
usurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to
thy next Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made
the scene of treasonable conspiracy against the King of England--Or, if
thou wilt, remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.â€

â€œTo be a guest in the house where I should command?â€ said the
Templar; â€œnever!--Chaplains, raise the Psalm, â€˜Quare fremuerunt
Gentes?â€™--Knights, squires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to
follow the banner of â€˜Beau-seant!â€™â€

The Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of
Englandâ€™s king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and
dismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the
watch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not
the timidity of the scared flock--there were dark brows of defiance, and
looks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words.
They drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white cloaks
of the knights were visible among the dusky garments of their retainers,
like the lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The multitude, who had
raised a clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and gazed in silence
on the formidable and experienced body to which they had unwarily bade
defiance, and shrunk back from their front.

The Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force,
dashed the rowels into his chargerâ€™s sides, and galloped backwards and
forwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable.
Richard alone, as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked,
rode slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, â€œWhat, sirs!
Among so many gallant knights, will none dare splinter a spear with
Richard?--Sirs of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if they
are not worth the shiver of a broken lance?â€

â€œThe Brethren of the Temple,â€ said the Grand Master, riding forward in
advance of their body, â€œfight not on such idle and profane quarrel--and
not with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my
presence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel, and
whether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which
thou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To
thine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which
we leave behind us, and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and offence
thou hast this day given to Christendom.â€

With these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave the
signal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an Oriental
character, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to advance.
They changed their array from a line to a column of march, and moved off
as slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was only the will
of their Grand Master, and no fear of the opposing and superior force,
which compelled them to withdraw.

â€œBy the splendour of Our Ladyâ€™s brow!â€ said King Richard, â€œit is pity
of their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they are
disciplined and valiant.â€

The multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of
its challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of
the squadron left the ground.

During the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca
saw and heard nothing--she was locked in the arms of her aged father,
giddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances
around her. But one word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered
feelings.

â€œLet us go,â€ he said, â€œmy dear daughter, my recovered treasure--let us
go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.â€

â€œNot so,â€ said Rebecca, â€œO no--no--no--I must not at this moment dare
to speak to him--Alas! I should say more than--No, my father, let us
instantly leave this evil place.â€

â€œBut, my daughter,â€ said Isaac, â€œto leave him who hath come forth like a
strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so
he might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a
people strange unto him and his--this is service to be thankfully
acknowledged.â€

â€œIt is--it is--most thankfully--most devoutly acknowledged,â€ said
Rebecca--â€œit shall be still more so--but not now--for the sake of thy
beloved Rachel, father, grant my request--not now!â€

â€œNay, but,â€ said Isaac, insisting, â€œthey will deem us more thankless
than mere dogs!â€

â€œBut thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and
that---â€

â€œTrue, my best--my wisest Rebecca!--Let us hence--let us hence!--Money
he will lack, for he has just returned from Palestine, and, as they say,
from prison--and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise
out of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us
hence!â€

And hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists,
and by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely
to the house of the Rabbi Nathan.

The Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the
day, having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was
transferred to the Black Knight. They now filled the air with â€œLong life
to Richard with the Lionâ€™s Heart, and down with the usurping Templars!â€

â€œNotwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,â€ said Ivanhoe to the Earl of
Essex, â€œit was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with him,
noble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.â€

The Earl smiled and shook his head.

â€œGallant Ivanhoe,â€ said Essex, â€œdost thou know our Master so well, and
yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards
York having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met
King Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in
his own person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with
his own single arm. I accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his
consent.â€

â€œAnd what news from York, brave Earl?â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œwill the rebels
bide us there?â€

â€œNo more than Decemberâ€™s snow will bide Julyâ€™s sun,â€ said the Earl;
â€œthey are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring us the news,
but John himself!â€

â€œThe traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œdid not
Richard order him into confinement?â€

â€œO! he received him,â€ answered the Earl, â€œas if they had met after a
hunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said, â€˜Thou
seest, brother, I have some angry men with me--thou wert best go to our
mother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until menâ€™s
minds are pacified.â€™â€

â€œAnd this was all he said?â€ enquired Ivanhoe; â€œwould not any one say
that this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?â€

â€œJust,â€ replied the Earl, â€œas the man may be said to invite death, who
undertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound unhealed.â€

â€œI forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,â€ said Ivanhoe; â€œbut, remember, I
hazarded but my own life--Richard, the welfare of his kingdom.â€

â€œThose,â€ replied Essex, â€œwho are specially careless of their own
welfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others--But let
us haste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the
subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their
principal.â€

From the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and
which are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that
Maurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of
Philip of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert, the
Preceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar Fitzurse, the
soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and Prince John,
for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his
good-natured brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the two
Malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well
deserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.

Briefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the
court of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that
had been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at
York. Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message--but he
refused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched every
hope that he had entertained of restoring a Saxon dynasty in England;
for, whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of a civil
war, it was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed
dominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities
and military fame, although his administration was wilfully careless,
now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.

But, moreover, it could not escape even Cedricâ€™s reluctant observation,
that his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the marriage
of Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual
dissent of both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event which, in
his ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even
when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he
could scarce bring himself to believe that two Saxons of royal descent
should scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the
public weal of the nation. But it was not the less certain: Rowena had
always expressed her repugnance to Athelstane, and now Athelstane was
no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue
his addresses to the Lady Rowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric
sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of
junction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with
each hand. He made, however, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and
he found that resuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country
squires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.

It seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint
Edmundâ€™s, Athelstaneâ€™s spirit of revenge, what between the natural
indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of
his mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the
clerical order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks in
the dungeons of Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For this
atrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a
dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by
himself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust
imprisonment they had sustained. With this controversy, and with the
means he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric
found the mind of his friend Athelstane so fully occupied, that it had
no room for another idea. And when Rowenaâ€™s name was mentioned the noble
Athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that
she might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a desperate
case therefore. There was obviously no more to be made of Athelstane;
or, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended from Saxon
times to ours, he was a cock that would not fight.

There remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers
desired to come to, only two obstacles--his own obstinacy, and his
dislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way
before the endearments of his ward, and the pride which he could not
help nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible
to the honour of allying his own line to that of Alfred, when the
superior claims of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were abandoned
for ever. Cedricâ€™s aversion to the Norman race of kings was also much
undermined,--first, by consideration of the impossibility of ridding
England of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create loyalty
in the subject to the king â€œde factoâ€; and, secondly, by the personal
attention of King Richard, who delighted in the blunt humour of Cedric,
and, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt with the
noble Saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven days, he
had given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and his son
Wilfred of Ivanhoe.

The nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were
celebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York.
The King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on
this and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded Saxons,
gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just
rights, than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of
a civil war. The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all
the splendour which she of Rome knows how to apply with such brilliant
effect.

Gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master
whom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated
with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of
Wilfredâ€™s dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to
expect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.

But besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were
celebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as
Saxons, joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that
marked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace
and harmony betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so
completely mingled, that the distinction has become wholly invisible.
Cedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion; for
as the two nations mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each
other, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons were refined from
their rusticity. But it was not until the reign of Edward the Third
that the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court
of London, and that the hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems
entirely to have disappeared.

It was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady
Rowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel
desired admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley might
be without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated, became curious, and
ended by commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants to
withdraw.

She entered--a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil,
in which she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the
elegance and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect,
unmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate
favour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to
the feelings, of others. She arose, and would have conducted her
lovely visitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again
intimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had no
sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the Lady
of Ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to
her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of Rowenaâ€™s
resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.

â€œWhat means this, lady?â€ said the surprised bride; â€œor why do you offer
to me a deference so unusual?â€

â€œBecause to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,â€ said Rebecca, rising up and resuming
the usual quiet dignity of her manner, â€œI may lawfully, and without
rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe.
I am--forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my
country--I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his
life against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.â€

â€œDamsel,â€ said Rowena, â€œWilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back but
in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds and
misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can serve
thee?â€

â€œNothing,â€ said Rebecca, calmly, â€œunless you will transmit to him my
grateful farewell.â€

â€œYou leave England then?â€ said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of
this extraordinary visit.

â€œI leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother
high in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada--thither we go,
secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the
Moslem exact from our people.â€

â€œAnd are you not then as well protected in England?â€ said Rowena.
â€œMy husband has favour with the King--the King himself is just and
generous.â€

â€œLady,â€ said Rebecca, â€œI doubt it not--but the people of England are a
fierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves,
and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. Such is
no safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is an heartless
dove--Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two
burdens. Not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by hostile
neighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can Israel hope to rest
during her wanderings.â€

â€œBut you, maiden,â€ said Rowena--â€œyou surely can have nothing to fear.
She who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,â€ she continued, rising with
enthusiasm--â€œshe can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and
Norman will contend who shall most do her honour.â€

â€œThy speech is fair, lady,â€ said Rebecca, â€œand thy purpose fairer; but
it may not be--there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our faith,
alike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell--yet, ere I go indulge me
one request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it, and
let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.â€

â€œThey are scarce worthy of being looked upon,â€ said Rowena; â€œbut,
expecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.â€

She took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of
beauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek,
brow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed also,
but it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past
slowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour
when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.

â€œLady,â€ she said, â€œthe countenance you have deigned to show me will long
dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and goodness; and
if a tinge of the worldâ€™s pride or vanities may mix with an expression
so lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some
colour of its original? Long, long will I remember your features, and
bless God that I leave my noble deliverer united with--â€

She stopped short--her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped them,
and answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena--â€œI am well, lady--well.
But my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists of
Templestowe.--Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my duty, remains
undischarged. Accept this casket--startle not at its contents.â€

Rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet,
or neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of
immense value.

â€œIt is impossible,â€ she said, tendering back the casket. â€œI dare not
accept a gift of such consequence.â€

â€œYet keep it, lady,â€ returned Rebecca.--â€œYou have power, rank, command,
influence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and weakness;
the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not influence half
so much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the gift is of little
value,--and to me, what I part with is of much less. Let me not think
you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe. Think
ye that I prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty?
or that my father values them in comparison to the honour of his only
child? Accept them, lady--to me they are valueless. I will never wear
jewels more.â€

â€œYou are then unhappy!â€ said Rowena, struck with the manner in which
Rebecca uttered the last words. â€œO, remain with us--the counsel of holy
men will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to you.â€

â€œNo, lady,â€ answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her
soft voice and beautiful features--â€œthat--may not be. I may not change
the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in
which I seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I
dedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.â€

â€œHave you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?â€ asked
Rowena.

â€œNo, lady,â€ said the Jewess; â€œbut among our people, since the time of
Abraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to
Heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the
sick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these will
Rebecca be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire
after the fate of her whose life he saved.â€

There was an involuntary tremour on Rebeccaâ€™s voice, and a tenderness
of accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have
expressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.

â€œFarewell,â€ she said. â€œMay He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower
down on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us hence will be
under weigh ere we can reach the port.â€

She glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision
had passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference to
her husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long and
happily with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the
bonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the
recollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it
would be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection
of Rebeccaâ€™s beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more
frequently than the fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have
approved.

Ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced
with farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still
higher, but for the premature death of the heroic Coeur-de-Lion, before
the Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With the life of a generous, but
rash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition
and his generosity had formed; to whom may be applied, with a slight
alteration, the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden--

     His fate was destined to a foreign strand,
     A petty fortress and an â€œhumbleâ€ hand;
     He left the name at which the world grew pale,
     To point a moral, or adorn a TALE.

VOLUME ONE

CHAPTER FIRST.

                How have I sinnâ€™d, that this affliction
            Should light so heavy on me? I have no more sons,
                And this no more mine own.--My grand curse
            Hang oâ€™er his head that thus transformed thee!--
                Travel? Iâ€™ll send my horse to travel next.
                                               Monsieur Thomas.

You have requested me, my dear friend, to bestow some of that leisure,
with which Providence has blessed the decline of my life, in registering
the hazards and difficulties which attended its commencement. The
recollection of those adventures, as you are pleased to term them, has
indeed left upon my mind a chequered and varied feeling of pleasure and
of pain, mingled, I trust, with no slight gratitude and veneration to the
Disposer of human events, who guided my early course through much risk
and labour, that the ease with which he has blessed my prolonged life
might seem softer from remembrance and contrast. Neither is it possible
for me to doubt, what you have often affirmed, that the incidents which
befell me among a people singularly primitive in their government and
manners, have something interesting and attractive for those who love to
hear an old manâ€™s stories of a past age.

Still, however, you must remember, that the tale told by one friend, and
listened to by another, loses half its charms when committed to paper;
and that the narratives to which you have attended with interest, as
heard from the voice of him to whom they occurred, will appear less
deserving of attention when perused in the seclusion of your study. But
your greener age and robust constitution promise longer life than will,
in all human probability, be the lot of your friend. Throw, then, these
sheets into some secret drawer of your escritoire till we are separated
from each otherâ€™s society by an event which may happen at any moment, and
which must happen within the course of a few--a very few years. When we
are parted in this world, to meet, I hope, in a better, you will, I am
well aware, cherish more than it deserves the memory of your departed
friend, and will find in those details which I am now to commit to paper,
matter for melancholy, but not unpleasing reflection. Others bequeath to
the confidants of their bosom portraits of their external features--I put
into your hands a faithful transcript of my thoughts and feelings, of my
virtues and of my failings, with the assured hope, that the follies and
headstrong impetuosity of my youth will meet the same kind construction
and forgiveness which have so often attended the faults of my matured
age.

One advantage, among the many, of addressing my Memoirs (if I may give
these sheets a name so imposing) to a dear and intimate friend, is, that
I may spare some of the details, in this case unnecessary, with which I
must needs have detained a stranger from what I have to say of greater
interest. Why should I bestow all my tediousness upon you, because I have
you in my power, and have ink, paper, and time before me? At the same
time, I dare not promise that I may not abuse the opportunity so
temptingly offered me, to treat of myself and my own concerns, even
though I speak of circumstances as well known to you as to myself. The
seductive love of narrative, when we ourselves are the heroes of the
events which we tell, often disregards the attention due to the time and
patience of the audience, and the best and wisest have yielded to its
fascination. I need only remind you of the singular instance evinced by
the form of that rare and original edition of Sullyâ€™s Memoirs, which you
(with the fond vanity of a book-collector) insist upon preferring to that
which is reduced to the useful and ordinary form of Memoirs, but which I
think curious, solely as illustrating how far so great a man as the
author was accessible to the foible of self-importance. If I recollect
rightly, that venerable peer and great statesman had appointed no fewer
than four gentlemen of his household to draw up the events of his life,
under the title of Memorials of the Sage and Royal Affairs of State,
Domestic, Political, and Military, transacted by Henry IV., and so forth.
These grave recorders, having made their compilation, reduced the Memoirs
containing all the remarkable events of their masterâ€™s life into a
narrative, addressed to himself in _propria persona._ And thus, instead
of telling his own story, in the third person, like Julius Caesar, or in
the first person, like most who, in the hall, or the study, undertake to
be the heroes of their own tale, Sully enjoyed the refined, though
whimsical pleasure, of having the events of his life told over to him by
his secretaries, being himself the auditor, as he was also the hero, and
probably the author, of the whole book. It must have been a great sight
to have seen the ex-minister, as bolt upright as a starched ruff and
laced cassock could make him, seated in state beneath his canopy, and
listening to the recitation of his compilers, while, standing bare in his
presence, they informed him gravely, â€œThus said the duke--so did the duke
infer--such were your graceâ€™s sentiments upon this important
point--such were your secret counsels to the king on that other
emergency,â€--circumstances, all of which must have been much better
known to their hearer than to themselves, and most of which could only
be derived from his own special communication.

My situation is not quite so ludicrous as that of the great Sully, and
yet there would be something whimsical in Frank Osbaldistone giving Will
Tresham a formal account of his birth, education, and connections in the
world. I will, therefore, wrestle with the tempting spirit of P. P.,
Clerk of our Parish, as I best may, and endeavour to tell you nothing
that is familiar to you already. Some things, however, I must recall to
your memory, because, though formerly well known to you, they may have
been forgotten through lapse of time, and they afford the ground-work of
my destiny.

You must remember my father well; for, as your own was a member of the
mercantile house, you knew him from infancy. Yet you hardly saw him in
his best days, before age and infirmity had quenched his ardent spirit of
enterprise and speculation. He would have been a poorer man, indeed, but
perhaps as happy, had he devoted to the extension of science those active
energies, and acute powers of observation, for which commercial pursuits
found occupation. Yet, in the fluctuations of mercantile speculation,
there is something captivating to the adventurer, even independent of the
hope of gain. He who embarks on that fickle sea, requires to possess the
skill of the pilot and the fortitude of the navigator, and after all may
be wrecked and lost, unless the gales of fortune breathe in his favour.
This mixture of necessary attention and inevitable hazard,--the frequent
and awful uncertainty whether prudence shall overcome fortune, or fortune
baffle the schemes of prudence, affords full occupation for the powers,
as well as for the feelings of the mind, and trade has all the
fascination of gambling without its moral guilt.

Early in the 18th century, when I (Heaven help me) was a youth of some
twenty years old, I was summoned suddenly from Bourdeaux to attend my
father on business of importance. I shall never forget our first
interview. You recollect the brief, abrupt, and somewhat stern mode in
which he was wont to communicate his pleasure to those around him.
Methinks I see him even now in my mindâ€™s eye;--the firm and upright
figure,--the step, quick and determined,--the eye, which shot so keen and
so penetrating a glance,--the features, on which care had already planted
wrinkles,--and hear his language, in which he never wasted word in vain,
expressed in a voice which had sometimes an occasional harshness, far
from the intention of the speaker.

When I dismounted from my post-horse, I hastened to my fatherâ€™s
apartment. He was traversing it with an air of composed and steady
deliberation, which even my arrival, although an only son unseen for four
years, was unable to discompose. I threw myself into his arms. He was a
kind, though not a fond father, and the tear twinkled in his dark eye,
but it was only for a moment.

â€œDubourg writes to me that he is satisfied with you, Frank.â€

â€œI am happy, sirâ€--

â€œBut I have less reason to be soâ€ he added, sitting down at his bureau.

â€œI am sorry, sirâ€--

â€œSorry and happy, Frank, are words that, on most occasions, signify
little or nothing--Here is your last letter.â€

He took it out from a number of others tied up in a parcel of red tape,
and curiously labelled and filed. There lay my poor epistle, written on
the subject the nearest to my heart at the time, and couched in words
which I had thought would work compassion if not conviction,--there, I
say, it lay, squeezed up among the letters on miscellaneous business in
which my fatherâ€™s daily affairs had engaged him. I cannot help smiling
internally when I recollect the mixture of hurt vanity, and wounded
feeling, with which I regarded my remonstrance, to the penning of which
there had gone, I promise you, some trouble, as I beheld it extracted
from amongst letters of advice, of credit, and all the commonplace
lumber, as I then thought them, of a merchantâ€™s correspondence. Surely,
thought I, a letter of such importance (I dared not say, even to myself,
so well written) deserved a separate place, as well as more anxious
consideration, than those on the ordinary business of the counting-house.

But my father did not observe my dissatisfaction, and would not have
minded it if he had. He proceeded, with the letter in his hand. â€œThis,
Frank, is yours of the 21st ultimo, in which you advise me (reading from
my letter), that in the most important business of forming a plan, and
adopting a profession for life, you trust my paternal goodness will hold
you entitled to at least a negative voice; that you have insuperable--ay,
insuperable is the word--I wish, by the way, you would write a more
distinct current hand--draw a score through the tops of your tâ€™s, and
open the loops of your lâ€™s--insuperable objections to the arrangements
which I have proposed to you. There is much more to the same effect,
occupying four good pages of paper, which a little attention to
perspicuity and distinctness of expression might have comprised within as
many lines. For, after all, Frank, it amounts but to this, that you will
not do as I would have you.â€

â€œThat I cannot, sir, in the present instance, not that I will not.â€

â€œWords avail very little with me, young man,â€ said my father, whose
inflexibility always possessed the air of the most perfect calmness of
self-possession. â€œ_Can not_ may be a more civil phrase than _will not,_
but the expressions are synonymous where there is no moral impossibility.
But I am not a friend to doing business hastily; we will talk this matter
over after dinner.--Owen!â€

Owen appeared, not with the silver locks which you were used to venerate,
for he was then little more than fifty; but he had the same, or an
exactly similar uniform suit of light-brown clothes,--the same pearl-grey
silk stockings,--the same stock, with its silver buckle,--the same
plaited cambric ruffles, drawn down over his knuckles in the parlour, but
in the counting-house carefully folded back under the sleeves, that they
might remain unstained by the ink which he daily consumed;--in a word,
the same grave, formal, yet benevolent cast of features, which continued
to his death to distinguish the head clerk of the great house of
Osbaldistone and Tresham.

â€œOwen,â€ said my father, as the kind old man shook me affectionately by
the hand, â€œyou must dine with us to-day, and hear the news Frank has
brought us from our friends in Bourdeaux.â€

Owen made one of his stiff bows of respectful gratitude; for, in those
days, when the distance between superiors and inferiors was enforced in a
manner to which the present times are strangers, such an invitation was a
favour of some little consequence.

I shall long remember that dinner-party. Deeply affected by feelings of
anxiety, not unmingled with displeasure, I was unable to take that active
share in the conversation which my father seemed to expect from me; and I
too frequently gave unsatisfactory answers to the questions with which he
assailed me. Owen, hovering betwixt his respect for his patron, and his
love for the youth he had dandled on his knee in childhood, like the
timorous, yet anxious ally of an invaded nation, endeavoured at every
blunder I made to explain my no-meaning, and to cover my retreat;
manoeuvres which added to my fatherâ€™s pettish displeasure, and brought a
share of it upon my kind advocate, instead of protecting me. I had not,
while residing in the house of Dubourg, absolutely conducted myself like

             A clerk condemnâ€™d his fatherâ€™s soul to cross,
             Who pennâ€™d a stanza when he should engross;--

but, to say truth, I had frequented the counting-house no more than I had
thought absolutely necessary to secure the good report of the Frenchman,
long a correspondent of our firm, to whom my father had trusted for
initiating me into the mysteries of commerce. In fact, my principal
attention had been dedicated to literature and manly exercises. My father
did not altogether discourage such acquirements, whether mental or
personal. He had too much good sense not to perceive, that they sate
gracefully upon every man, and he was sensible that they relieved and
dignified the character to which he wished me to aspire. But his chief
ambition was, that I should succeed not merely to his fortune, but to the
views and plans by which he imagined he could extend and perpetuate the
wealthy inheritance which he designed for me.

Love of his profession was the motive which he chose should be most
ostensible, when he urged me to tread the same path; but he had others
with which I only became acquainted at a later period. Impetuous in his
schemes, as well as skilful and daring, each new adventure, when
successful, became at once the incentive, and furnished the means, for
farther speculation. It seemed to be necessary to him, as to an ambitious
conqueror, to push on from achievement to achievement, without stopping
to secure, far less to enjoy, the acquisitions which he made. Accustomed
to see his whole fortune trembling in the scales of chance, and dexterous
at adopting expedients for casting the balance in his favour, his health
and spirits and activity seemed ever to increase with the animating
hazards on which he staked his wealth; and he resembled a sailor,
accustomed to brave the billows and the foe, whose confidence rises on
the eve of tempest or of battle. He was not, however, insensible to the
changes which increasing age or supervening malady might make in his own
constitution; and was anxious in good time to secure in me an assistant,
who might take the helm when his hand grew weary, and keep the vesselâ€™s
way according to his counsel and instruction. Paternal affection, as well
as the furtherance of his own plans, determined him to the same
conclusion. Your father, though his fortune was vested in the house, was
only a sleeping partner, as the commercial phrase goes; and Owen, whose
probity and skill in the details of arithmetic rendered his services
invaluable as a head clerk, was not possessed either of information or
talents sufficient to conduct the mysteries of the principal management.
If my father were suddenly summoned from life, what would become of the
world of schemes which he had formed, unless his son were moulded into a
commercial Hercules, fit to sustain the weight when relinquished by the
falling Atlas? and what would become of that son himself, if, a stranger
to business of this description, he found himself at once involved in the
labyrinth of mercantile concerns, without the clew of knowledge necessary
for his extraction? For all these reasons, avowed and secret, my father
was determined I should embrace his profession; and when he was
determined, the resolution of no man was more immovable. I, however, was
also a party to be consulted, and, with something of his own pertinacity,
I had formed a determination precisely contrary. It may, I hope, be some
palliative for the resistance which, on this occasion, I offered to my
fatherâ€™s wishes, that I did not fully understand upon what they were
founded, or how deeply his happiness was involved in them. Imagining
myself certain of a large succession in future, and ample maintenance in
the meanwhile, it never occurred to me that it might be necessary, in
order to secure these blessings, to submit to labour and limitations
unpleasant to my taste and temper. I only saw in my fatherâ€™s proposal for
my engaging in business, a desire that I should add to those heaps of
wealth which he had himself acquired; and imagining myself the best judge
of the path to my own happiness, I did not conceive that I should
increase that happiness by augmenting a fortune which I believed was
already sufficient, and more than sufficient, for every use, comfort, and
elegant enjoyment.

Accordingly, I am compelled to repeat, that my time at Bourdeaux had not
been spent as my father had proposed to himself. What he considered as
the chief end of my residence in that city, I had postponed for every
other, and would (had I dared) have neglected altogether. Dubourg, a
favoured and benefited correspondent of our mercantile house, was too
much of a shrewd politician to make such reports to the head of the firm
concerning his only child, as would excite the displeasure of both; and
he might also, as you will presently hear, have views of selfish
advantage in suffering me to neglect the purposes for which I was placed
under his charge. My conduct was regulated by the bounds of decency and
good order, and thus far he had no evil report to make, supposing him so
disposed; but, perhaps, the crafty Frenchman would have been equally
complaisant, had I been in the habit of indulging worse feelings than
those of indolence and aversion to mercantile business. As it was, while
I gave a decent portion of my time to the commercial studies he
recommended, he was by no means envious of the hours which I dedicated to
other and more classical attainments, nor did he ever find fault with me
for dwelling upon Corneille and Boileau, in preference to Postlethwayte
(supposing his folio to have then existed, and Monsieur Dubourg able to
have pronounced his name), or Savary, or any other writer on commercial
economy. He had picked up somewhere a convenient expression, with which
he rounded off every letter to his correspondent,--â€œI was all,â€ he said,
â€œthat a father could wish.â€

My father never quarrelled with a phrase, however frequently repeated,
provided it seemed to him distinct and expressive; and Addison himself
could not have found expressions so satisfactory to him as, â€œYours
received, and duly honoured the bills enclosed, as per margin.â€

Knowing, therefore, very well what he desired me to, be, Mr. Osbaldistone
made no doubt, from the frequent repetition of Dubourgâ€™s favourite
phrase, that I was the very thing he wished to see me; when, in an evil
hour, he received my letter, containing my eloquent and detailed apology
for declining a place in the firm, and a desk and stool in the corner of
the dark counting-house in Crane Alley, surmounting in height those of
Owen, and the other clerks, and only inferior to the tripod of my father
himself. All was wrong from that moment. Dubourgâ€™s reports became as
suspicious as if his bills had been noted for dishonour. I was summoned
home in all haste, and received in the manner I have already communicated
to you.





CHAPTER SECOND.

     I begin shrewdly to suspect the young man of a terrible
     taint--Poetry; with which idle disease if he be infected,
     thereâ€™s no hope of him in astate course. _Actum est_ of him
     for a commonwealthâ€™s man, if he gotoâ€™t in rhyme once.
                                        Ben Jonsonâ€™s _Bartholomew Fair._

My father had, generally speaking, his temper under complete
self-command, and his anger rarely indicated itself by words, except in
a sort of dry testy manner, to those who had displeased him. He never
used threats, or expressions of loud resentment. All was arranged with
him on system, and it was his practice to do â€œthe needfulâ€ on every
occasion, without wasting words about it. It was, therefore, with a
bitter smile that he listened to my imperfect answers concerning the
state of commerce in France, and unmercifully permitted me to involve
myself deeper and deeper in the mysteries of agio, tariffs, tare and
tret; nor can I charge my memory with his having looked positively
angry, until he found me unable to explain the exact effect which the
depreciation of the louis dâ€™or had produced on the negotiation of bills
of exchange. â€œThe most remarkable national occurrence in my time,â€ said
my father (who nevertheless had seen the Revolution)--â€œand he knows no
more of it than a post on the quay!â€

â€œMr. Francis,â€ suggested Owen, in his timid and conciliatory manner,
â€œcannot have forgotten, that by an _arret_ of the King of France, dated
1st May 1700, it was provided that the _porteur,_ within ten days after
due, must make demandâ€--

â€œMr. Francis,â€ said my father, interrupting him, â€œwill, I dare say,
recollect for the moment anything you are so kind as hint to him. But,
body oâ€™ me! how Dubourg could permit him! Hark ye, Owen, what sort of a
youth is Clement Dubourg, his nephew there, in the office, the
black-haired lad?â€

â€œOne of the cleverest clerks, sir, in the house; a prodigious young man
for his time,â€ answered Owen; for the gaiety and civility of the young
Frenchman had won his heart.

â€œAy, ay, I suppose _he_ knows something of the nature of exchange.
Dubourg was determined I should have one youngster at least about my hand
who understood business. But I see his drift, and he shall find that I do
so when he looks at the balance-sheet. Owen, let Clementâ€™s salary be paid
up to next quarter-day, and let him ship himself back to Bourdeaux in his
fatherâ€™s ship, which is clearing out yonder.â€

â€œDismiss Clement Dubourg, sir?â€ said Owen, with a faltering voice.

â€œYes, sir, dismiss him instantly; it is enough to have a stupid
Englishman in the counting-house to make blunders, without keeping a
sharp Frenchman there to profit by them.â€

I had lived long enough in the territories of the _Grand Monarque_ to
contract a hearty aversion to arbitrary exertion of authority, even if it
had not been instilled into me with my earliest breeding; and I could not
refrain from interposing, to prevent an innocent and meritorious young
man from paying the penalty of having acquired that proficiency which my
father had desired for me.

â€œI beg pardon, sir,â€ when Mr. Osbaldistone had done speaking; â€œbut I
think it but just, that if I have been negligent of my studies, I should
pay the forfeit myself. I have no reason to charge Monsieur Dubourg with
having neglected to give me opportunities of improvement, however little
I may have profited by them; and with respect to Monsieur Clement
Dubourgâ€--

â€œWith respect to him, and to you, I shall take the measures which I see
needful,â€ replied my father; â€œbut it is fair in you, Frank, to take your
own blame on your own shoulders--very fair, that cannot be denied.--I
cannot acquit old Dubourg,â€ he said, looking to Owen, â€œfor having merely
afforded Frank the means of useful knowledge, without either seeing that
he took advantage of them or reporting to me if he did not. You see,
Owen, he has natural notions of equity becoming a British merchant.â€

â€œMr. Francis,â€ said the head-clerk, with his usual formal inclination of
the head, and a slight elevation of his right hand, which he had acquired
by a habit of sticking his pen behind his ear before he spoke--â€œMr.
Francis seems to understand the fundamental principle of all moral
accounting, the great ethic rule of three. Let A do to B, as he would
have B do to him; the product will give the rule of conduct required.â€

My father smiled at this reduction of the golden rule to arithmetical
form, but instantly proceeded.

â€œAll this signifies nothing, Frank; you have been throwing away your time
like a boy, and in future you must learn to live like a man. I shall put
you under Owenâ€™s care for a few months, to recover the lost ground.â€

I was about to reply, but Owen looked at me with such a supplicatory and
warning gesture, that I was involuntarily silent.

â€œWe will then,â€ continued my father, â€œresume the subject of mine of the
1st ultimo, to which you sent me an answer which was unadvised and
unsatisfactory. So now, fill your glass, and push the bottle to Owen.â€

Want of courage--of audacity if you will--was never my failing. I
answered firmly, â€œI was sorry that my letter was unsatisfactory,
unadvised it was not; for I had given the proposal his goodness had made
me, my instant and anxious attention, and it was with no small pain that
I found myself obliged to decline it.â€

My father bent his keen eye for a moment on me, and instantly withdrew
it. As he made no answer, I thought myself obliged to proceed, though
with some hesitation, and he only interrupted me by monosyllables.--â€œIt
is impossible, sir, for me to have higher respect for any character than
I have for the commercial, even were it not yours.â€

â€œIndeed!â€

â€œIt connects nation with nation, relieves the wants, and contributes to
the wealth of all; and is to the general commonwealth of the civilised
world what the daily intercourse of ordinary life is to private society,
or rather, what air and food are to our bodies.â€

â€œWell, sir?â€

â€œAnd yet, sir, I find myself compelled to persist in declining to adopt a
character which I am so ill qualified to support.â€

â€œI will take care that you acquire the qualifications necessary. You are
no longer the guest and pupil of Dubourg.â€

â€œBut, my dear sir, it is no defect of teaching which I plead, but my own
inability to profit by instruction.â€

â€œNonsense.--Have you kept your journal in the terms I desired?â€

â€œYes, sir.â€

â€œBe pleased to bring it here.â€

The volume thus required was a sort of commonplace book, kept by my
fatherâ€™s recommendation, in which I had been directed to enter notes of
the miscellaneous information which I had acquired in the course of my
studies. Foreseeing that he would demand inspection of this record, I had
been attentive to transcribe such particulars of information as he would
most likely be pleased with, but too often the pen had discharged the
task without much correspondence with the head. And it had also happened,
that, the book being the receptacle nearest to my hand, I had
occasionally jotted down memoranda which had little regard to traffic. I
now put it into my fatherâ€™s hand, devoutly hoping he might light on
nothing that would increase his displeasure against me. Owenâ€™s face,
which had looked something blank when the question was put, cleared up at
my ready answer, and wore a smile of hope, when I brought from my
apartment, and placed before my father, a commercial-looking volume,
rather broader than it was long, having brazen clasps and a binding of
rough calf. This looked business-like, and was encouraging to my
benevolent well-wisher. But he actually smiled with pleasure as he heard
my father run over some part of the contents, muttering his critical
remarks as he went on.

â€œ_--Brandies--Barils and barricants, also tonneaux.--At Nantz 29--Velles
to the barique at Cognac and Rochelle 27--At Bourdeaux 32_--Very right,
Frank--_Duties on tonnage and custom-house, see Saxbyâ€™s Tables_--Thatâ€™s
not well; you should have transcribed the passage; it fixes the thing in
the memory--_Reports outward and inward--Corn debentures--Over-sea
Cockets--Linens--Isingham--Gentish--Stock-fish--Titling--Cropling--
Lub-fish._ You should have noted that they are all, nevertheless to be
entered as titlings.--How many inches long is a titling?â€

Owen, seeing me at fault, hazarded a whisper, of which I fortunately
caught the import.

â€œEighteen inches, sir.â€--

â€œAnd a lub-fish is twenty-four--very right. It is important to remember
this, on account of the Portuguese trade--But what have we here?--
_Bourdeaux founded in the year--Castle of the Trompette--Palace of
Gallienus_--Well, well, thatâ€™s very right too.--This is a kind of
waste-book, Owen, in which all the transactions of the day,--emptions,
orders, payments, receipts, acceptances, draughts, commissions, and
advices,--are entered miscellaneously.â€

â€œThat they may be regularly transferred to the day-book and ledger,â€
 answered Owen: â€œI am glad Mr. Francis is so methodical.â€

I perceived myself getting so fast into favour, that I began to fear the
consequence would be my fatherâ€™s more obstinate perseverance in his
resolution that I must become a merchant; and as I was determined on the
contrary, I began to wish I had not, to use my friend Mr. Owenâ€™s phrase,
been so methodical. But I had no reason for apprehension on that score;
for a blotted piece of paper dropped out of the book, and, being taken up
by my father, he interrupted a hint from Owen, on the propriety of
securing loose memoranda with a little paste, by exclaiming, â€œTo the
memory of Edward the Black Prince--Whatâ€™s all this?--verses!--By Heaven,
Frank, you are a greater blockhead than I supposed you!â€

My father, you must recollect, as a man of business, looked upon the
labour of poets with contempt; and as a religious man, and of the
dissenting persuasion, he considered all such pursuits as equally trivial
and profane. Before you condemn him, you must recall to remembrance how
too many of the poets in the end of the seventeenth century had led their
lives and employed their talents. The sect also to which my father
belonged, felt, or perhaps affected, a puritanical aversion to the
lighter exertions of literature. So that many causes contributed to
augment the unpleasant surprise occasioned by the ill-timed discovery of
this unfortunate copy of verses. As for poor Owen, could the bob-wig
which he then wore have uncurled itself, and stood on end with horror, I
am convinced the morningâ€™s labour of the friseur would have been undone,
merely by the excess of his astonishment at this enormity. An inroad on
the strong-box, or an erasure in the ledger, or a mis-summation in a
fitted account, could hardly have surprised him more disagreeably. My
father read the lines sometimes with an affectation of not being able to
understand the sense--sometimes in a mouthing tone of mock heroic--always
with an emphasis of the most bitter irony, most irritating to the nerves
of an author.

                    â€œO for the voice of that wild horn,
                     On Fontarabian echoes borne,
                           The dying heroâ€™s call,
                     That told imperial Charlemagne,
                     How Paynim sons of swarthy Spain
                     Had wrought his championâ€™s fall.

â€œ_Fontarabian echoes!_â€ continued my father, interrupting himself; â€œthe
Fontarabian Fair would have been more to the purpose--_Paynim!_--Whatâ€™s
Paynim?--Could you not say Pagan as well, and write English at least, if
you must needs write nonsense?--


                    â€œSad over earth and ocean sounding.
                And Englandâ€™s distant cliffs astounding.
                     Such are the notes should say
                How Britainâ€™s hope, and Franceâ€™s fear,
                     Victor of Cressy and Poitier,
                          In Bordeaux dying lay.â€

â€œPoitiers, by the way, is always spelt with an _s,_ and I know no reason
why orthography should give place to rhyme.--


                 â€œâ€˜Raise my faint head, my squires,â€™ he said,
                  â€˜And let the casement be displayâ€™d,
                       That I may see once more
                   The splendour of the setting sun
                   Gleam on thy mirrored wave, Garonne,
                       And Blayeâ€™s empurpled shore.

â€œ_Garonne_ and _sun_ is a bad rhyme. Why, Frank, you do not even
understand the beggarly trade you have chosen.

                 â€œâ€˜Like me, he sinks to Gloryâ€™s sleep,
                  His fall the dews of evening steep,
                         As if in sorrow shed,
                  So soft shall fall the trickling tear,
                  When Englandâ€™s maids and matrons hear
                        Of their Black Edward dead.

                      â€œâ€˜And though my sun of glory set,
                 Nor France, nor England, shall forget
                        The terror of my name;
                 And oft shall Britainâ€™s heroes rise,
                 New planets in these southern skies,
                       Through clouds of blood and flame.â€™

â€œA cloud of flame is something new--Good-morrow, my masters all, and a
merry Christmas to you!--Why, the bellman writes better lines.â€ He then
tossed the paper from him with an air of superlative contempt, and
concluded--â€œUpon my credit, Frank, you are a greater blockhead than I
took you for.â€

What could I say, my dear Tresham? There I stood, swelling with indignant
mortification, while my father regarded me with a calm but stern look of
scorn and pity; and poor Owen, with uplifted hands and eyes, looked as
striking a picture of horror as if he had just read his patronâ€™s name in
the Gazette. At length I took courage to speak, endeavouring that my tone
of voice should betray my feelings as little as possible.

â€œI am quite aware, sir, how ill qualified I am to play the conspicuous
part in society you have destined for me; and, luckily, I am not
ambitious of the wealth I might acquire. Mr. Owen would be a much more
effective assistant.â€ I said this in some malice, for I considered Owen
as having deserted my cause a little too soon.

â€œOwen!â€ said my father--â€œThe boy is mad--actually insane. And, pray, sir,
if I may presume to inquire, having coolly turned me over to Mr. Owen
(although I may expect more attention from any one than from my son),
what may your own sage projects be?â€

â€œI should wish, sir,â€ I replied, summoning up my courage, â€œto travel for
two or three years, should that consist with your pleasure; otherwise,
although late, I would willingly spend the same time at Oxford or
Cambridge.â€

â€œIn the name of common sense! was the like ever heard?--to put yourself
to school among pedants and Jacobites, when you might be pushing your
fortune in the world! Why not go to Westminster or Eton at once, man, and
take to Lillyâ€™s Grammar and Accidence, and to the birch, too, if you like
it?â€

â€œThen, sir, if you think my plan of improvement too late, I would
willingly return to the Continent.â€

â€œYou have already spent too much time there to little purpose, Mr.
Francis.â€

â€œThen I would choose the army, sir, in preference to any other active
line of life.â€

â€œChoose the d--l!â€ answered my father, hastily, and then checking
himself--â€œI profess you make me as great a fool as you are yourself. Is
he not enough to drive one mad, Owen?â€--Poor Owen shook his head, and
looked down. â€œHark ye, Frank,â€ continued my father, â€œI will cut all this
matter very short. I was at your age when my father turned me out of
doors, and settled my legal inheritance on my younger brother. I left
Osbaldistone Hall on the back of a broken-down hunter, with ten guineas
in my purse. I have never crossed the threshold again, and I never will.
I know not, and I care not, if my fox-hunting brother is alive, or has
broken his neck; but he has children, Frank, and one of them shall be my
son if you cross me farther in this matter.â€

â€œYou will do your pleasure,â€ I answered--rather, I fear, with more sullen
indifference than respect, â€œwith what is your own.â€

â€œYes, Frank, what I have _is_ my own, if labour in getting, and care in
augmenting, can make a right of property; and no drone shall feed on my
honeycomb. Think on it well: what I have said is not without reflection,
and what I resolve upon I will execute.â€

â€œHonoured sir!--dear sir!â€ exclaimed Owen, tears rushing into his eyes,
â€œyou are not wont to be in such a hurry in transacting business of
importance. Let Mr. Francis run up the balance before you shut the
account; he loves you, I am sure; and when he puts down his filial
obedience to the _per contra,_ I am sure his objections will disappear.â€

â€œDo you think I will ask him twice,â€ said my father, sternly, â€œto be my
friend, my assistant, and my confidant?--to be a partner of my cares and
of my fortune?--Owen, I thought you had known me better.â€

He looked at me as if he meant to add something more, but turned
instantly away, and left the room abruptly. I was, I own, affected by
this view of the case, which had not occurred to me; and my father would
probably have had little reason to complain of me, had he commenced the
discussion with this argument.

But it was too late. I had much of his own obduracy of resolution, and
Heaven had decreed that my sin should be my punishment, though not to the
extent which my transgression merited. Owen, when we were left alone,
continued to look at me with eyes which tears from time to time
moistened, as if to discover, before attempting the task of intercessor,
upon what point my obstinacy was most assailable. At length he began,
with broken and disconcerted accents,--â€œO L--d, Mr. Francis!--Good
Heavens, sir!--My stars, Mr. Osbaldistone!--that I should ever have seen
this day--and you so young a gentleman, sir!--For the love of Heaven!
look at both sides of the account--think what you are going to lose--a
noble fortune, sir--one of the finest houses in the City, even under the
old firm of Tresham and Trent, and now Osbaldistone and Tresham--You
might roll in gold, Mr. Francis--And, my dear young Mr. Frank, if there
was any particular thing in the business of the house which you disliked,
I wouldâ€ (sinking his voice to a whisper) â€œput it in order for you
termly, or weekly, or daily, if you will--Do, my dear Mr. Francis, think
of the honour due to your father, that your days may be long in the
land.â€

â€œI am much obliged to you, Mr. Owen,â€ said I--â€œvery much obliged indeed;
but my father is best judge how to bestow his money. He talks of one of
my cousins: let him dispose of his wealth as he pleases--I will never
sell my liberty for gold.â€

â€œGold, sir?--I wish you saw the balance-sheet of profits at last term--It
was in five figures--five figures to each partnerâ€™s sum total, Mr.
Frank--And all this is to go to a Papist, and a north-country booby, and
a disaffected person besides--It will break my heart, Mr. Francis, that
have been toiling more like a dog than a man, and all for love of
the firm. Think how it will sound, Osbaldistone, Tresham, and
Osbaldistone--or perhaps, who knowsâ€ (again lowering his voice),
â€œOsbaldistone, Osbaldistone, and Tresham, for our Mr. Osbaldistone can
buy them all out.â€

â€œBut, Mr. Owen, my cousinâ€™s name being also Osbaldistone, the name of the
company will sound every bit as well in your ears.â€

â€œO fie upon you, Mr. Francis, when you know how well I love you--Your
cousin, indeed!--a Papist, no doubt, like his father, and a disaffected
person to the Protestant succession--thatâ€™s another item, doubtless.â€

â€œThere are many very good men Catholics, Mr. Owen,â€ rejoined I.

As Owen was about to answer with unusual animation, my father re-entered
the apartment.

â€œYou were right,â€ he said, â€œOwen, and I was wrong; we will take more time
to think over this matter.--Young man, you will prepare to give me an
answer on this important subject this day month.â€

I bowed in silence, sufficiently glad of a reprieve, and trusting it
might indicate some relaxation in my fatherâ€™s determination.

The time of probation passed slowly, unmarked by any accident whatever. I
went and came, and disposed of my time as I pleased, without question or
criticism on the part of my father. Indeed, I rarely saw him, save at
meal-times, when he studiously avoided a discussion which you may well
suppose I was in no hurry to press onward. Our conversation was of the
news of the day, or on such general topics as strangers discourse upon to
each other; nor could any one have guessed, from its tenor, that there
remained undecided betwixt us a dispute of such importance. It haunted
me, however, more than once, like the nightmare. Was it possible he would
keep his word, and disinherit his only son in favour of a nephew whose
very existence he was not perhaps quite certain of? My grandfatherâ€™s
conduct, in similar circumstances, boded me no good, had I considered the
matter rightly. But I had formed an erroneous idea of my fatherâ€™s
character, from the importance which I recollected I maintained with him
and his whole family before I went to France. I was not aware that there
are men who indulge their children at an early age, because to do so
interests and amuses them, and who can yet be sufficiently severe when
the same children cross their expectations at a more advanced period. On
the contrary, I persuaded myself, that all I had to apprehend was some
temporary alienation of affection--perhaps a rustication of a few weeks,
which I thought would rather please me than otherwise, since it would
give me an opportunity of setting about my unfinished version of Orlando
Furioso, a poem which I longed to render into English verse. I suffered
this belief to get such absolute possession of my mind, that I had
resumed my blotted papers, and was busy in meditation on the
oft-recurring rhymes of the Spenserian stanza, when I heard a low and
cautious tap at the door of my apartment. â€œCome in,â€ I said, and Mr. Owen
entered. So regular were the motions and habits of this worthy man, that
in all probability this was the first time he had ever been in the second
story of his patronâ€™s house, however conversant with the first; and I am
still at a loss to know in what manner he discovered my apartment.

â€œMr. Francis,â€ he said, interrupting my expression of surprise and
pleasure at seeing, him, â€œI do not know if I am doing well in what I am
about to say--it is not right to speak of what passes in the
compting-house out of doors--one should not tell, as they say, to the
post in the warehouse, how many lines there are in the ledger. But young
Twineall has been absent from the house for a fortnight and more, until
two days since.â€

â€œVery well, my dear sir, and how does that concern us?â€

â€œStay, Mr. Francis;--your father gave him a private commission; and I am
sure he did not go down to Falmouth about the pilchard affair; and the
Exeter business with Blackwell and Company has been settled; and the
mining people in Cornwall, Trevanion and Treguilliam, have paid all they
are likely to pay; and any other matter of business must have been put
through my books:--in short, itâ€™s my faithful belief that Twineall has
been down in the north.â€

â€œDo you really suppose?â€ so said I, somewhat startled.

â€œHe has spoken about nothing, sir, since he returned, but his new boots,
and his Ripon spurs, and a cockfight at York--itâ€™s as true as the
multiplication-table. Do, Heaven bless you, my dear child, make up your
mind to please your father, and to be a man and a merchant at once.â€

I felt at that instant a strong inclination to submit, and to make Owen
happy by requesting him to tell my father that I resigned myself to his
disposal. But pride--pride, the source of so much that is good and so
much that is evil in our course of life, prevented me. My acquiescence
stuck in my throat; and while I was coughing to get it up, my fatherâ€™s
voice summoned Owen. He hastily left the room, and the opportunity was
lost.

My father was methodical in everything. At the very same time of the day,
in the same apartment, and with the same tone and manner which he had
employed an exact month before, he recapitulated the proposal he had made
for taking me into partnership, and assigning me a department in the
counting-house, and requested to have my final decision. I thought at the
time there was something unkind in this; and I still think that my
fatherâ€™s conduct was injudicious. A more conciliatory treatment would, in
all probability, have gained his purpose. As it was, I stood fast, and,
as respectfully as I could, declined the proposal he made to me.
Perhaps--for who can judge of their own heart?--I felt it unmanly to
yield on the first summons, and expected farther solicitation, as at
least a pretext for changing my mind. If so, I was disappointed; for my
father turned coolly to Owen, and only said, â€œYou see it is as I told
you.--Well, Frankâ€ (addressing me), â€œyou are nearly of age, and as well
qualified to judge of what will constitute your own happiness as you
ever are like to be; therefore, I say no more. But as I am not bound to
give in to your plans, any more than you are compelled to submit to
mine, may I ask to know if you have formed any which depend on my
assistance?â€

I answered, not a little abashed, â€œThat being bred to no profession, and
having no funds of my own, it was obviously impossible for me to subsist
without some allowance from my father; that my wishes were very moderate;
and that I hoped my aversion for the profession to which he had designed
me, would not occasion his altogether withdrawing his paternal support
and protection.â€

â€œThat is to say, you wish to lean on my arm, and yet to walk your own
way? That can hardly be, Frank;--however, I suppose you mean to obey my
directions, so far as they do not cross your own humour?â€

I was about to speak--â€œSilence, if you please,â€ he continued. â€œSupposing
this to be the case, you will instantly set out for the north of England,
to pay your uncle a visit, and see the state of his family. I have chosen
from among his sons (he has six, I believe) one who, I understand, is
most worthy to fill the place I intended for you in the counting-house.
But some farther arrangements may be necessary, and for these your
presence may be requisite. You shall have farther instructions at
Osbaldistone Hall, where you will please to remain until you hear from
me. Everything will be ready for your departure to-morrow morning.â€

With these words my father left the apartment.

â€œWhat does all this mean, Mr. Owen?â€ said I to my sympathetic friend,
whose countenance wore a cast of the deepest dejection.

â€œYou have ruined yourself, Mr. Frank, thatâ€™s all. When your father talks
in that quiet determined manner, there will be no more change in him than
in a fitted account.â€

And so it proved; for the next morning, at five oâ€™clock, I found myself
on the road to York, mounted on a reasonably good horse, and with fifty
guineas in my pocket; travelling, as it would seem, for the purpose of
assisting in the adoption of a successor to myself in my fatherâ€™s house
and favour, and, for aught I knew, eventually in his fortune also.





CHAPTER THIRD.


                  The slack sail shifts from side to side,
                  The boat, untrimmâ€™d, admits the tide,
                  Borne down, adrift, at random tost,
                  The oar breaks short, the rudderâ€™s lost.
                                        Gayâ€™s _Fables._

I have tagged with rhyme and blank verse the subdivisions of this
important narrative, in order to seduce your continued attention by
powers of composition of stronger attraction than my own. The preceding
lines refer to an unfortunate navigator, who daringly unloosed from its
moorings a boat, which he was unable to manage, and thrust it off into
the full tide of a navigable river. No schoolboy, who, betwixt frolic and
defiance, has executed a similar rash attempt, could feel himself, when
adrift in a strong current, in a situation more awkward than mine, when I
found myself driving, without a compass, on the ocean of human life.
There had been such unexpected ease in the manner in which my father
slipt a knot, usually esteemed the strongest which binds society
together, and suffered me to depart as a sort of outcast from his family,
that it strangely lessened the confidence in my own personal
accomplishments, which had hitherto sustained me. Prince Prettyman, now a
prince, and now a fisherâ€™s son, had not a more awkward sense of his
degradation. We are so apt, in our engrossing egotism, to consider all
those accessories which are drawn around us by prosperity, as pertaining
and belonging to our own persons, that the discovery of our unimportance,
when left to our own proper resources, becomes inexpressibly mortifying.
As the hum of London died away on my ear, the distant peal of her
steeples more than once sounded to my ears the admonitory â€œTurn again,â€
 erst heard by her future Lord Mayor; and when I looked back from Highgate
on her dusky magnificence, I felt as if I were leaving behind me comfort,
opulence, the charms of society, and all the pleasures of cultivated
life.

But the die was cast. It was, indeed, by no means probable that a late
and ungracious compliance with my fatherâ€™s wishes would have reinstated
me in the situation which I had lost. On the contrary, firm and strong of
purpose as he himself was, he might rather have been disgusted than
conciliated by my tardy and compulsory acquiescence in his desire that I
should engage in commerce. My constitutional obstinacy came also to my
aid, and pride whispered how poor a figure I should make, when an airing
of four miles from London had blown away resolutions formed during a
monthâ€™s serious deliberation. Hope, too, that never forsakes the young
and hardy, lent her lustre to my future prospects. My father could not be
serious in the sentence of foris-familiation, which he had so
unhesitatingly pronounced. It must be but a trial of my disposition,
which, endured with patience and steadiness on my part, would raise me in
his estimation, and lead to an amicable accommodation of the point in
dispute between us. I even settled in my own mind how far I would concede
to him, and on what articles of our supposed treaty I would make a firm
stand; and the result was, according to my computation, that I was to be
reinstated in my full rights of filiation, paying the easy penalty of
some ostensible compliances to atone for my past rebellion.

In the meanwhile, I was lord of my person, and experienced that feeling
of independence which the youthful bosom receives with a thrilling
mixture of pleasure and apprehension. My purse, though by no means amply
replenished, was in a situation to supply all the wants and wishes of a
traveller. I had been accustomed, while at Bourdeaux, to act as my own
valet; my horse was fresh, young, and active, and the buoyancy of my
spirits soon surmounted the melancholy reflections with which my journey
commenced.

I should have been glad to have journeyed upon a line of road better
calculated to afford reasonable objects of curiosity, or a more
interesting country, to the traveller. But the north road was then, and
perhaps still is, singularly deficient in these respects; nor do I
believe you can travel so far through Britain in any other direction
without meeting more of what is worthy to engage the attention. My mental
ruminations, notwithstanding my assumed confidence, were not always of an
unchequered nature. The Muse too,--the very coquette who had led me into
this wilderness,--like others of her sex, deserted me in my utmost need,
and I should have been reduced to rather an uncomfortable state of
dulness, had it not been for the occasional conversation of strangers who
chanced to pass the same way. But the characters whom I met with were of
a uniform and uninteresting description. Country parsons, jogging
homewards after a visitation; farmers, or graziers, returning from a
distant market; clerks of traders, travelling to collect what was due to
their masters, in provincial towns; with now and then an officer going
down into the country upon the recruiting service, were, at this period,
the persons by whom the turnpikes and tapsters were kept in exercise. Our
speech, therefore, was of tithes and creeds, of beeves and grain, of
commodities wet and dry, and the solvency of the retail dealers,
occasionally varied by the description of a siege, or battle, in
Flanders, which, perhaps, the narrator only gave me at second hand.
Robbers, a fertile and alarming theme, filled up every vacancy; and the
names of the Golden Farmer, the Flying Highwayman, Jack Needham, and
other Beggarsâ€™ Opera heroes, were familiar in our mouths as household
words. At such tales, like children closing their circle round the fire
when the ghost story draws to its climax, the riders drew near to each
other, looked before and behind them, examined the priming of their
pistols, and vowed to stand by each other in case of danger; an
engagement which, like other offensive and defensive alliances, sometimes
glided out of remembrance when there was an appearance of actual peril.

Of all the fellows whom I ever saw haunted by terrors of this nature, one
poor man, with whom I travelled a day and a half, afforded me most
amusement. He had upon his pillion a very small, but apparently a very
weighty portmanteau, about the safety of which he seemed particularly
solicitous; never trusting it out of his own immediate care, and
uniformly repressing the officious zeal of the waiters and ostlers, who
offered their services to carry it into the house. With the same
precaution he laboured to conceal, not only the purpose of his journey,
and his ultimate place of destination, but even the direction of each
dayâ€™s route. Nothing embarrassed him more than to be asked by any one,
whether he was travelling upwards or downwards, or at what stage he
intended to bait. His place of rest for the night he scrutinised with the
most anxious care, alike avoiding solitude, and what he considered as bad
neighbourhood; and at Grantham, I believe, he sate up all night to avoid
sleeping in the next room to a thick-set squinting fellow, in a black
wig, and a tarnished gold-laced waistcoat. With all these cares on his
mind, my fellow traveller, to judge by his thews and sinews, was a man
who might have set danger at defiance with as much impunity as most men.
He was strong and well built; and, judging from his gold-laced hat and
cockade, seemed to have served in the army, or, at least, to belong to
the military profession in one capacity or other. His conversation also,
though always sufficiently vulgar, was that of a man of sense, when the
terrible bugbears which haunted his imagination for a moment ceased to
occupy his attention. But every accidental association recalled them. An
open heath, a close plantation, were alike subjects of apprehension; and
the whistle of a shepherd lad was instantly converted into the signal of
a depredator. Even the sight of a gibbet, if it assured him that one
robber was safely disposed of by justice, never failed to remind him how
many remained still unhanged.

I should have wearied of this fellowâ€™s company, had I not been still more
tired of my own thoughts. Some of the marvellous stories, however, which
he related, had in themselves a cast of interest, and another whimsical
point of his peculiarities afforded me the occasional opportunity of
amusing myself at his expense. Among his tales, several of the
unfortunate travellers who fell among thieves, incurred that calamity
from associating themselves on the road with a well-dressed and
entertaining stranger, in whose company they trusted to find protection
as well as amusement; who cheered their journey with tale and song,
protected them against the evils of over-charges and false reckonings,
until at length, under pretext of showing a near path over a desolate
common, he seduced his unsuspicious victims from the public road into
some dismal glen, where, suddenly blowing his whistle, he assembled his
comrades from their lurking-place, and displayed himself in his true
colours--the captain, namely, of the band of robbers to whom his unwary
fellow-travellers had forfeited their purses, and perhaps their lives.
Towards the conclusion of such a tale, and when my companion had wrought
himself into a fever of apprehension by the progress of his own
narrative, I observed that he usually eyed me with a glance of doubt and
suspicion, as if the possibility occurred to him, that he might, at that
very moment, be in company with a character as dangerous as that which
his tale described. And ever and anon, when such suggestions pressed
themselves on the mind of this ingenious self-tormentor, he drew off from
me to the opposite side of the high-road, looked before, behind, and
around him, examined his arms, and seemed to prepare himself for flight
or defence, as circumstances might require.

The suspicion implied on such occasions seemed to me only momentary, and
too ludicrous to be offensive. There was, in fact, no particular
reflection on my dress or address, although I was thus mistaken for a
robber. A man in those days might have all the external appearance of a
gentleman, and yet turn out to be a highwayman. For the division of
labour in every department not having then taken place so fully as since
that period, the profession of the polite and accomplished adventurer,
who nicked you out of your money at Whiteâ€™s, or bowled you out of it at
Marylebone, was often united with that of the professed ruffian, who on
Bagshot Heath, or Finchley Common, commanded his brother beau to stand
and deliver. There was also a touch of coarseness and hardness about the
manners of the times, which has since, in a great degree, been softened
and shaded away. It seems to me, on recollection, as if desperate men had
less reluctance then than now to embrace the most desperate means of
retrieving their fortune. The times were indeed past, when Anthony-a-Wood
mourned over the execution of two men, goodly in person, and of
undisputed courage and honour, who were hanged without mercy at Oxford,
merely because their distress had driven them to raise contributions on
the highway. We were still farther removed from the days of â€œthe mad
Prince and Poins.â€ And yet, from the number of unenclosed and extensive
heaths in the vicinity of the metropolis, and from the less populous
state of remote districts, both were frequented by that species of
mounted highwaymen, that may possibly become one day unknown, who carried
on their trade with something like courtesy; and, like Gibbet in the
Beaux Stratagem, piqued themselves on being the best behaved men on the
road, and on conducting themselves with all appropriate civility in the
exercise of their vocation. A young man, therefore, in my circumstances
was not entitled to be highly indignant at the mistake which confounded
him with this worshipful class of depredators.

Neither was I offended. On the contrary, I found amusement in alternately
exciting, and lulling to sleep, the suspicions of my timorous companion,
and in purposely so acting as still farther to puzzle a brain which
nature and apprehension had combined to render none of the clearest. When
my free conversation had lulled him into complete security, it required
only a passing inquiry concerning the direction of his journey, or the
nature of the business which occasioned it, to put his suspicions once
more in arms. For example, a conversation on the comparative strength and
activity of our horses, took such a turn as follows:--

â€œO sir,â€ said my companion, â€œfor the gallop I grant you; but allow me to
say, your horse (although he is a very handsome gelding--that must be
owned,) has too little bone to be a good roadster. The trot, sirâ€
 (striking his Bucephalus with his spurs),--â€œthe trot is the true pace for
a hackney; and, were we near a town, I should like to try that
daisy-cutter of yours upon a piece of level road (barring canter) for a
quart of claret at the next inn.â€

â€œContent, sir,â€ replied I; â€œand here is a stretch of ground very
favourable.â€

â€œHem, ahem,â€ answered my friend with hesitation; â€œI make it a rule of
travelling never to blow my horse between stages; one never knows what
occasion he may have to put him to his mettle: and besides, sir, when I
said I would match you, I meant with even weight; you ride four stone
lighter than I.â€

â€œVery well; but I am content to carry weight. Pray, what may that
portmanteau of yours weigh?â€

â€œMy p-p-portmanteau?â€ replied he, hesitating--â€œO very little--a
feather--just a few shirts and stockings.â€

â€œI should think it heavier, from its appearance. Iâ€™ll hold you the quart
of claret it makes the odds betwixt our weight.â€

â€œYouâ€™re mistaken, sir, I assure you--quite mistaken,â€ replied my friend,
edging off to the side of the road, as was his wont on these alarming
occasions.

â€œWell, I am willing to venture the wine; or, I will bet you ten pieces to
five, that I carry your portmanteau on my croupe, and out-trot you into
the bargain.â€

This proposal raised my friendâ€™s alarm to the uttermost. His nose changed
from the natural copper hue which it had acquired from many a comfortable
cup of claret or sack, into a palish brassy tint, and his teeth chattered
with apprehension at the unveiled audacity of my proposal, which seemed
to place the barefaced plunderer before him in full atrocity. As he
faltered for an answer, I relieved him in some degree by a question
concerning a steeple, which now became visible, and an observation that
we were now so near the village as to run no risk from interruption on
the road. At this his countenance cleared up: but I easily perceived that
it was long ere he forgot a proposal which seemed to him so fraught with
suspicion as that which I had now hazarded. I trouble you with this
detail of the manâ€™s disposition, and the manner in which I practised upon
it, because, however trivial in themselves, these particulars were
attended by an important influence on future incidents which will occur
in this narrative. At the time, this personâ€™s conduct only inspired me
with contempt, and confirmed me in an opinion which I already
entertained, that of all the propensities which teach mankind to torment
themselves, that of causeless fear is the most irritating, busy, painful,
and pitiable.





CHAPTER FOURTH.


             The Scots are poor, cries surly English pride.
             True is the charge; nor by themselves denied.
             Are they not, then, in strictest reason clear,
             Who wisely come to mend their fortunes here?
                                             Churchill.

There was, in the days of which I write, an old-fashioned custom on the
English road, which I suspect is now obsolete, or practised only by the
vulgar. Journeys of length being made on horseback, and, of course, by
brief stages, it was usual always to make a halt on the Sunday in some
town where the traveller might attend divine service, and his horse have
the benefit of the day of rest, the institution of which is as humane to
our brute labourers as profitable to ourselves. A counterpart to this
decent practice, and a remnant of old English hospitality, was, that the
landlord of a principal inn laid aside his character of a publican on the
seventh day, and invited the guests who chanced to be within his walls to
take a part of his family beef and pudding. This invitation was usually
complied with by all whose distinguished rank did not induce them to
think compliance a derogation; and the proposal of a bottle of wine after
dinner, to drink the landlordâ€™s health, was the only recompense ever
offered or accepted.

I was born a citizen of the world, and my inclination led me into all
scenes where my knowledge of mankind could be enlarged; I had, besides,
no pretensions to sequester myself on the score of superior dignity, and
therefore seldom failed to accept of the Sundayâ€™s hospitality of mine
host, whether of the Garter, Lion, or Bear. The honest publican, dilated
into additional consequence by a sense of his own importance, while
presiding among the guests on whom it was his ordinary duty to attend,
was in himself an entertaining, spectacle; and around his genial orbit,
other planets of inferior consequence performed their revolutions. The
wits and humorists, the distinguished worthies of the town or village,
the apothecary, the attorney, even the curate himself, did not disdain to
partake of this hebdomadal festivity. The guests, assembled from
different quarters, and following different professions, formed, in
language, manners, and sentiments, a curious contrast to each other, not
indifferent to those who desired to possess a knowledge of mankind in its
varieties.

It was on such a day, and such an occasion, that my timorous acquaintance
and I were about to grace the board of the ruddy-faced host of the Black
Bear, in the town of Darlington, and bishopric of Durham, when our
landlord informed us, with a sort of apologetic tone, that there was a
Scotch gentleman to dine with us.

â€œA gentleman!--what sort of a gentleman?â€ said my companion somewhat
hastily--his mind, I suppose, running on gentlemen of the pad, as they
were then termed.

â€œWhy, a Scotch sort of a gentleman, as I said before,â€ returned mine
host; â€œthey are all gentle, ye mun know, though they haâ€™ narra shirt to
back; but this is a decentish hallion--a canny North Briton as eâ€™er
crossâ€™d Berwick Bridge--I trow heâ€™s a dealer in cattle.â€

â€œLet us have his company, by all means,â€ answered my companion; and then,
turning to me, he gave vent to the tenor of his own reflections. â€œI
respect the Scotch, sir; I love and honour the nation for their sense of
morality. Men talk of their filth and their poverty: but commend me to
sterling honesty, though clad in rags, as the poet saith. I have been
credibly assured, sir, by men on whom I can depend, that there was never
known such a thing in Scotland as a highway robbery.â€

â€œThatâ€™s because they have nothing to lose,â€ said mine host, with the
chuckle of a self-applauding wit.

â€œNo, no, landlord,â€ answered a strong deep voice behind him, â€œitâ€™s eâ€™en
because your English gaugers and supervisors, that you have sent down
benorth the Tweed, have taen up the trade of thievery over the heads of
the native professors.â€


â€œWell said, Mr. Campbell,â€ answered the landlord; â€œI did not think
thoudâ€™st been sae near us, mon. But thou kens Iâ€™m an outspoken Yorkshire
tyke. And how go markets in the south?â€

â€œEven in the ordinar,â€ replied Mr. Campbell; â€œwise folks buy and sell,
and fools are bought and sold.â€

â€œBut wise men and fools both eat their dinner,â€ answered our jolly
entertainer; â€œand here a comes--as prime a buttock of beef as eâ€™er hungry
men stuck fork in.â€

So saying, he eagerly whetted his knife, assumed his seat of empire at
the head of the board, and loaded the plates of his sundry guests with
his good cheer.

This was the first time I had heard the Scottish accent, or, indeed, that
I had familiarly met with an individual of the ancient nation by whom it
was spoken. Yet, from an early period, they had occupied and interested
my imagination. My father, as is well known to you, was of an ancient
family in Northumberland, from whose seat I was, while eating the
aforesaid dinner, not very many miles distant. The quarrel betwixt him
and his relatives was such, that he scarcely ever mentioned the race from
which he sprung, and held as the most contemptible species of vanity, the
weakness which is commonly termed family pride. His ambition was only to
be distinguished as William Osbaldistone, the first, at least one of the
first, merchants on Change; and to have proved him the lineal
representative of William the Conqueror would have far less flattered his
vanity than the hum and bustle which his approach was wont to produce
among the bulls, bears, and brokers of Stock-alley. He wished, no doubt,
that I should remain in such ignorance of my relatives and descent as
might insure a correspondence between my feelings and his own on this
subject. But his designs, as will happen occasionally to the wisest,
were, in some degree at least, counteracted by a being whom his pride
would never have supposed of importance adequate to influence them in any
way. His nurse, an old Northumbrian woman, attached to him from his
infancy, was the only person connected with his native province for whom
he retained any regard; and when fortune dawned upon him, one of the
first uses which he made of her favours, was to give Mabel Rickets a
place of residence within his household. After the death of my mother,
the care of nursing me during my childish illnesses, and of rendering all
those tender attentions which infancy exacts from female affection,
devolved on old Mabel. Interdicted by her master from speaking to him on
the subject of the heaths, glades, and dales of her beloved
Northumberland, she poured herself forth to my infant ear in descriptions
of the scenes of her youth, and long narratives of the events which
tradition declared to have passed amongst them. To these I inclined my
ear much more seriously than to graver, but less animated instructors.
Even yet, methinks I see old Mabel, her head slightly agitated by the
palsy of age, and shaded by a close cap, as white as the driven
snow,--her face wrinkled, but still retaining the healthy tinge which it
had acquired in rural labour--I think I see her look around on the brick
walls and narrow street which presented themselves before our windows,
as she concluded with a sigh the favourite old ditty, which I then
preferred, and--why should I not tell the truth?--which I still prefer
to all the opera airs ever minted by the capricious brain of an Italian
Mus. D.--

             Oh, the oak, the ash, and the bonny ivy tree,
             They flourish best at home in the North Countrie!

Now, in the legends of Mabel, the Scottish nation was ever freshly
remembered, with all the embittered declamation of which the narrator was
capable. The inhabitants of the opposite frontier served in her
narratives to fill up the parts which ogres and giants with seven-leagued
boots occupy in the ordinary nursery tales. And how could it be
otherwise? Was it not the Black Douglas who slew with his own hand the
heir of the Osbaldistone family the day after he took possession of his
estate, surprising him and his vassals while solemnizing a feast suited
to the occasion? Was it not Wat the Devil, who drove all the year-old
hogs off the braes of Lanthorn-side, in the very recent days of my
grandfatherâ€™s father? And had we not many a trophy, but, according to old
Mabelâ€™s version of history, far more honourably gained, to mark our
revenge of these wrongs? Did not Sir Henry Osbaldistone, fifth baron of
the name, carry off the fair maid of Fairnington, as Achilles did his
Chryseis and Briseis of old, and detain her in his fortress against all
the power of her friends, supported by the most mighty Scottish chiefs of
warlike fame? And had not our swords shone foremost at most of those
fields in which England was victorious over her rival? All our family
renown was acquired--all our family misfortunes were occasioned--by the
northern wars.

Warmed by such tales, I looked upon the Scottish people during my
childhood, as a race hostile by nature to the more southern inhabitants
of this realm; and this view of the matter was not much corrected by the
language which my father sometimes held with respect to them. He had
engaged in some large speculations concerning oak-woods, the property of
Highland proprietors, and alleged, that he found them much more ready to
make bargains, and extort earnest of the purchase-money, than punctual in
complying on their side with the terms of the engagements. The Scottish
mercantile men, whom he was under the necessity of employing as a sort of
middle-men on these occasions, were also suspected by my father of having
secured, by one means or other, more than their own share of the profit
which ought to have accrued. In short, if Mabel complained of the
Scottish arms in ancient times, Mr. Osbaldistone inveighed no less
against the arts of these modern Sinons; and between them, though without
any fixed purpose of doing so, they impressed my youthful mind with a
sincere aversion to the northern inhabitants of Britain, as a people
bloodthirsty in time of war, treacherous during truce, interested,
selfish, avaricious, and tricky in the business of peaceful life, and
having few good qualities, unless there should be accounted such, a
ferocity which resembled courage in martial affairs, and a sort of wily
craft which supplied the place of wisdom in the ordinary commerce of
mankind. In justification, or apology, for those who entertained such
prejudices, I must remark, that the Scotch of that period were guilty of
similar injustice to the English, whom they branded universally as a race
of purse-proud arrogant epicures. Such seeds of national dislike remained
between the two countries, the natural consequences of their existence as
separate and rival states. We have seen recently the breath of a
demagogue blow these sparks into a temporary flame, which I sincerely
hope is now extinguished in its own ashes. 

It was, then, with an impression of dislike, that I contemplated the
first Scotchman I chanced to meet in society. There was much about him
that coincided with my previous conceptions. He had the hard features and
athletic form said to be peculiar to his country, together with the
national intonation and slow pedantic mode of expression, arising from a
desire to avoid peculiarities of idiom or dialect. I could also observe
the caution and shrewdness of his country in many of the observations
which he made, and the answers which he returned. But I was not prepared
for the air of easy self-possession and superiority with which he seemed
to predominate over the company into which he was thrown, as it were by
accident. His dress was as coarse as it could be, being still decent;
and, at a time when great expense was lavished upon the wardrobe, even of
the lowest who pretended to the character of gentleman, this indicated
mediocrity of circumstances, if not poverty. His conversation intimated
that he was engaged in the cattle trade, no very dignified professional
pursuit. And yet, under these disadvantages, he seemed, as a matter of
course, to treat the rest of the company with the cool and condescending
politeness which implies a real, or imagined, superiority over those
towards whom it is used. When he gave his opinion on any point, it was
with that easy tone of confidence used by those superior to their society
in rank or information, as if what he said could not be doubted, and was
not to be questioned. Mine host and his Sunday guests, after an effort or
two to support their consequence by noise and bold averment, sunk
gradually under the authority of Mr. Campbell, who thus fairly possessed
himself of the lead in the conversation. I was tempted, from curiosity,
to dispute the ground with him myself, confiding in my knowledge of the
world, extended as it was by my residence abroad, and in the stores with
which a tolerable education had possessed my mind. In the latter respect
he offered no competition, and it was easy to see that his natural powers
had never been cultivated by education. But I found him much better
acquainted than I was myself with the present state of France, the
character of the Duke of Orleans, who had just succeeded to the regency
of that kingdom, and that of the statesmen by whom he was surrounded; and
his shrewd, caustic, and somewhat satirical remarks, were those of a man
who had been a close observer of the affairs of that country.

On the subject of politics, Campbell observed a silence and moderation
which might arise from caution. The divisions of Whig and Tory then shook
England to her very centre, and a powerful party, engaged in the Jacobite
interest, menaced the dynasty of Hanover, which had been just established
on the throne. Every alehouse resounded with the brawls of contending
politicians, and as mine hostâ€™s politics were of that liberal description
which quarrelled with no good customer, his hebdomadal visitants were
often divided in their opinion as irreconcilably as if he had feasted the
Common Council. The curate and the apothecary, with a little man, who
made no boast of his vocation, but who, from the flourish and snap of his
fingers, I believe to have been the barber, strongly espoused the cause
of high church and the Stuart line. The excise-man, as in duty bound, and
the attorney, who looked to some petty office under the Crown, together
with my fellow-traveller, who seemed to enter keenly into the contest,
staunchly supported the cause of King George and the Protestant
succession. Dire was the screaming--deep the oaths! Each party appealed
to Mr. Campbell, anxious, it seemed, to elicit his approbation.

â€œYou are a Scotchman, sir; a gentleman of your country must stand up for
hereditary right,â€ cried one party.

â€œYou are a Presbyterian,â€ assumed the other class of disputants; â€œyou
cannot be a friend to arbitrary power.â€

â€œGentlemen,â€ said our Scotch oracle, after having gained, with some
difficulty, a momentâ€™s pause, â€œI havena much dubitation that King George
weel deserves the predilection of his friends; and if he can haud the
grip he has gotten, why, doubtless, he may made the gauger, here, a
commissioner of the revenue, and confer on our friend, Mr. Quitam, the
preferment of solicitor-general; and he may also grant some good deed or
reward to this honest gentleman who is sitting upon his portmanteau,
which he prefers to a chair: And, questionless, King James is also a
grateful person, and when he gets his hand in play, he may, if he be so
minded, make this reverend gentleman archprelate of Canterbury, and Dr.
Mixit chief physician to his household, and commit his royal beard to the
care of my friend Latherum. But as I doubt mickle whether any of the
competing sovereigns would give Rob Campbell a tass of aquavitae, if he
lacked it, I give my vote and interest to Jonathan Brown, our landlord,
to be the King and Prince of Skinkers, conditionally that he fetches us
another bottle as good as the last.â€

This sally was received with general applause, in which the landlord
cordially joined; and when he had given orders for fulfilling the
condition on which his preferment was to depend, he failed not to
acquaint them, â€œthat, for as peaceable a gentleman as Mr. Campbell was,
he was, moreover, as bold as a lion--seven highwaymen had he defeated
with his single arm, that beset him as he came from Whitson-Tryste.â€

â€œThou art deceived, friend Jonathan,â€ said Campbell, interrupting him;
â€œthey were but barely two, and two cowardly loons as man could wish to
meet withal.â€

â€œAnd did you, sir, really,â€ said my fellow-traveller, edging his chair (I
should have said his portmanteau) nearer to Mr. Campbell, â€œreally and
actually beat two highwaymen yourself alone?â€

â€œIn troth did I, sir,â€ replied Campbell; â€œand I think it nae great thing
to make a sang about.â€

â€œUpon my word, sir,â€ replied my acquaintance, â€œI should be happy to have
the pleasure of your company on my journey--I go northward, sir.â€

This piece of gratuitous information concerning the route he proposed to
himself, the first I had heard my companion bestow upon any one, failed
to excite the corresponding confidence of the Scotchman.

â€œWe can scarce travel together,â€ he replied, drily. â€œYou, sir, doubtless,
are well mounted, and I for the present travel on foot, or on a Highland
shelty, that does not help me much faster forward.â€

So saying, he called for a reckoning for the wine, and throwing down the
price of the additional bottle which he had himself introduced, rose as
if to take leave of us. My companion made up to him, and taking him by
the button, drew him aside into one of the windows. I could not help
overhearing him pressing something--I supposed his company upon the
journey, which Mr. Campbell seemed to decline.

â€œI will pay your charges, sir,â€ said the traveller, in a tone as if he
thought the argument should bear down all opposition.

â€œIt is quite impossible,â€ said Campbell, somewhat contemptuously; â€œI have
business at Rothbury.â€

â€œBut I am in no great hurry; I can ride out of the way, and never miss a
day or so for good company.â€

â€œUpon my faith, sir,â€ said Campbell, â€œI cannot render you the service you
seem to desiderate. I am,â€ he added, drawing himself up haughtily,
â€œtravelling on my own private affairs, and if ye will act by my
advisement, sir, ye will neither unite yourself with an absolute stranger
on the road, nor communicate your line of journey to those who are asking
ye no questions about it.â€ He then extricated his button, not very
ceremoniously, from the hold which detained him, and coming up to me as
the company were dispersing, observed, â€œYour friend, sir, is too
communicative, considering the nature of his trust.â€

â€œThat gentleman,â€ I replied, looking towards the traveller, â€œis no friend
of mine, but an acquaintance whom I picked up on the road. I know neither
his name nor business, and you seem to be deeper in his confidence than I
am.â€

â€œI only meant,â€ he replied hastily, â€œthat he seems a thought rash in
conferring the honour of his company on those who desire it not.â€

â€œThe gentleman,â€ replied I, â€œknows his own affairs best, and I should be
sorry to constitute myself a judge of them in any respect.â€

Mr. Campbell made no farther observation, but merely wished me a good
journey, and the party dispersed for the evening.

Next day I parted company with my timid companion, as I left the great
northern road to turn more westerly in the direction of Osbaldistone
Manor, my uncleâ€™s seat. I cannot tell whether he felt relieved or
embarrassed by my departure, considering the dubious light in which he
seemed to regard me. For my own part, his tremors ceased to amuse me,
and, to say the truth, I was heartily glad to get rid of him.





CHAPTER FIFTH.


                How melts my beating heart as I behold
           Each lovely nymph, our islandâ€™s boast and pride,
                Push on the generous steed, that sweeps along
           Oâ€™er rough, oâ€™er smooth, nor heeds the steepy hill,
                Nor falters in the extended vale below!
                                               The Chase.

I approached my native north, for such I esteemed it, with that
enthusiasm which romantic and wild scenery inspires in the lovers of
nature. No longer interrupted by the babble of my companion, I could now
remark the difference which the country exhibited from that through which
I had hitherto travelled. The streams now more properly deserved the
name, for, instead of slumbering stagnant among reeds and willows, they
brawled along beneath the shade of natural copsewood; were now hurried
down declivities, and now purled more leisurely, but still in active
motion, through little lonely valleys, which, opening on the road from
time to time, seemed to invite the traveller to explore their recesses.
The Cheviots rose before me in frowning majesty; not, indeed, with the
sublime variety of rock and cliff which characterizes mountains of the
primary class but huge, round-headed, and clothed with a dark robe of
russet, gaining, by their extent and desolate appearance, an influence
upon the imagination, as a desert district possessing a character of its
own.

The abode of my fathers, which I was now approaching, was situated in a
glen, or narrow valley, which ran up among those hills. Extensive
estates, which once belonged to the family of Osbaldistone, had been long
dissipated by the misfortunes or misconduct of my ancestors; but enough
was still attached to the old mansion, to give my uncle the title of a
man of large property. This he employed (as I was given to understand by
some inquiries which I made on the road) in maintaining the prodigal
hospitality of a northern squire of the period, which he deemed essential
to his family dignity.

From the summit of an eminence I had already had a distant view of
Osbaldistone Hall, a large and antiquated edifice, peeping out from a
Druidical grove of huge oaks; and I was directing my course towards it,
as straightly and as speedily as the windings of a very indifferent road
would permit, when my horse, tired as he was, pricked up his ears at the
enlivening notes of a pack of hounds in full cry, cheered by the
occasional bursts of a French horn, which in those days was a constant
accompaniment to the chase. I made no doubt that the pack was my uncleâ€™s,
and drew up my horse with the purpose of suffering the hunters to pass
without notice, aware that a hunting-field was not the proper scene to
introduce myself to a keen sportsman, and determined when they had passed
on, to proceed to the mansion-house at my own pace, and there to await
the return of the proprietor from his sport. I paused, therefore, on a
rising ground, and, not unmoved by the sense of interest which that
species of silvan sport is so much calculated to inspire (although my
mind was not at the moment very accessible to impressions of this
nature), I expected with some eagerness the appearance of the huntsmen.

The fox, hard run, and nearly spent, first made his appearance from the
copse which clothed the right-hand side of the valley. His drooping
brush, his soiled appearance, and jaded trot, proclaimed his fate
impending; and the carrion crow, which hovered over him, already
considered poor Reynard as soon to be his prey. He crossed the stream
which divides the little valley, and was dragging himself up a ravine on
the other side of its wild banks, when the headmost hounds, followed by
the rest of the pack in full cry, burst from the coppice, followed by the
huntsman and three or four riders. The dogs pursued the trace of Reynard
with unerring instinct; and the hunters followed with reckless haste,
regardless of the broken and difficult nature of the ground. They were
tall, stout young men, well mounted, and dressed in green and red, the
uniform of a sporting association, formed under the auspices of old Sir
Hildebrand Osbaldistone.--â€œMy cousins!â€ thought I, as they swept past me.
The next reflection was, what is my reception likely to be among these
worthy successors of Nimrod? and how improbable is it that I, knowing
little or nothing of rural sports, shall find myself at ease, or happy,
in my uncleâ€™s family. A vision that passed me interrupted these
reflections.

It was a young lady, the loveliness of whose very striking features was
enhanced by the animation of the chase and the glow of the exercise,
mounted on a beautiful horse, jet black, unless where he was flecked by
spots of the snow-white foam which embossed his bridle. She wore, what
was then somewhat unusual, a coat, vest, and hat, resembling those of a
man, which fashion has since called a riding habit. The mode had been
introduced while I was in France, and was perfectly new to me. Her long
black hair streamed on the breeze, having in the hurry of the chase
escaped from the ribbon which bound it. Some very broken ground, through
which she guided her horse with the most admirable address and presence
of mind, retarded her course, and brought her closer to me than any of
the other riders had passed. I had, therefore, a full view of her
uncommonly fine face and person, to which an inexpressible charm was
added by the wild gaiety of the scene, and the romance of her singular
dress and unexpected appearance. As she passed me, her horse made, in his
impetuosity, an irregular movement, just while, coming once more upon
open ground, she was again putting him to his speed. It served as an
apology for me to ride close up to her, as if to her assistance. There
was, however, no cause for alarm; it was not a stumble, nor a false step;
and, if it had, the fair Amazon had too much self-possession to have been
deranged by it. She thanked my good intentions, however, by a smile, and
I felt encouraged to put my horse to the same pace, and to keep in her
immediate neighbourhood. The clamour of â€œWhoop! dead! dead!â€--and the
corresponding flourish of the French horn, soon announced to us that
there was no more occasion for haste, since the chase was at a close. One
of the young men whom we had seen approached us, waving the brush of the
fox in triumph, as if to upbraid my fair companion,

â€œI see,â€ she replied,--â€œI see; but make no noise about it: if Phoebe,â€
 she said, patting the neck of the beautiful animal on which she rode,
â€œhad not got among the cliffs, you would have had little cause for
boasting.â€

They met as she spoke, and I observed them both look at me, and converse
a moment in an under-tone, the young lady apparently pressing the
sportsman to do something which he declined shyly, and with a sort of
sheepish sullenness. She instantly turned her horseâ€™s head towards me,
saying,--â€œWell, well, Thornie, if you wonâ€™t, I must, thatâ€™s all.--Sir,â€
 she continued, addressing me, â€œI have been endeavouring to persuade this
cultivated young gentleman to make inquiry of you whether, in the course
of your travels in these parts, you have heard anything of a friend of
ours, one Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, who has been for some days expected
at Osbaldistone Hall?â€

I was too happy to acknowledge myself to be the party inquired after, and
to express my thanks for the obliging inquiries of the young lady.

â€œIn that case, sir,â€ she rejoined, â€œas my kinsmanâ€™s politeness seems to
be still slumbering, you will permit me (though I suppose it is highly
improper) to stand mistress of ceremonies, and to present to you young
Squire Thorncliff Osbaldistone, your cousin, and Die Vernon, who has also
the honour to be your accomplished cousinâ€™s poor kinswoman.â€

There was a mixture of boldness, satire, and simplicity in the manner in
which Miss Vernon pronounced these words. My knowledge of life was
sufficient to enable me to take up a corresponding tone as I expressed my
gratitude to her for her condescension, and my extreme pleasure at having
met with them. To say the truth, the compliment was so expressed, that
the lady might easily appropriate the greater share of it, for Thorncliff
seemed an arrant country bumpkin, awkward, shy, and somewhat sulky
withal. He shook hands with me, however, and then intimated his intention
of leaving me that he might help the huntsman and his brothers to couple
up the hounds,--a purpose which he rather communicated by way of
information to Miss Vernon than as apology to me.

â€œThere he goes,â€ said the young lady, following him with eyes in which
disdain was admirably painted--â€œthe prince of grooms and cock-fighters,
and blackguard horse-coursers. But there is not one of them to mend
another.--Have you read Markham?â€ said Miss Vernon.

â€œRead whom, maâ€™am?--I do not even remember the authorâ€™s name.â€

â€œO lud! on what a strand are you wrecked!â€ replied the young lady. â€œA
poor forlorn and ignorant stranger, unacquainted with the very Alcoran of
the savage tribe whom you are come to reside among--Never to have heard
of Markham, the most celebrated author on farriery! then I fear you are
equally a stranger to the more modern names of Gibson and Bartlett?â€

â€œI am, indeed, Miss Vernon.â€

â€œAnd do you not blush to own it?â€ said Miss Vernon. â€œWhy, we must
forswear your alliance. Then, I suppose, you can neither give a ball, nor
a mash, nor a horn!â€

â€œI confess I trust all these matters to an ostler, or to my groom.â€

â€œIncredible carelessness!--And you cannot shoe a horse, or cut his mane
and tail; or worm a dog, or crop his ears, or cut his dew-claws; or
reclaim a hawk, or give him his casting-stones, or direct his diet when
he is sealed; orâ€--

â€œTo sum up my insignificance in one word,â€ replied I, â€œI am profoundly
ignorant in all these rural accomplishments.â€

â€œThen, in the name of Heaven, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, what _can_ you
do?â€

â€œVery little to the purpose, Miss Vernon; something, however, I can
pretend to--When my groom has dressed my horse I can ride him, and when
my hawk is in the field, I can fly him.â€

â€œCan you do this?â€ said the young lady, putting her horse to a canter.

There was a sort of rude overgrown fence crossed the path before us, with
a gate composed of pieces of wood rough from the forest; I was about to
move forward to open it, when Miss Vernon cleared the obstruction at a
flying leap. I was bound in point of honour to follow, and was in a
moment again at her side. â€œThere are hopes of you yet,â€ she said. â€œI was
afraid you had been a very degenerate Osbaldistone. But what on earth
brings you to Cub-Castle?--for so the neighbours have christened this
hunting-hall of ours. You might have stayed away, I suppose, if you
would?â€

I felt I was by this time on a very intimate footing with my beautiful
apparition, and therefore replied, in a confidential under-tone--â€œIndeed,
my dear Miss Vernon, I might have considered it as a sacrifice to be a
temporary resident in Osbaldistone Hall, the inmates being such as you
describe them; but I am convinced there is one exception that will make
amends for all deficiencies.â€

â€œO, you mean Rashleigh?â€ said Miss Vernon.

â€œIndeed I do not; I was thinking--forgive me--of some person much nearer
me.â€

â€œI suppose it would be proper not to understand your civility?--But that
is not my way--I donâ€™t make a courtesy for it because I am sitting on
horseback. But, seriously, I deserve your exception, for I am the only
conversable being about the Hall, except the old priest and Rashleigh.â€

â€œAnd who is Rashleigh, for Heavenâ€™s sake?â€

â€œRashleigh is one who would fain have every one like him for his own
sake. He is Sir Hildebrandâ€™s youngest son--about your own age, but not
so--not well looking, in short. But nature has given him a mouthful of
common sense, and the priest has added a bushelful of learning; he is
what we call a very clever man in this country, where clever men are
scarce. Bred to the church, but in no hurry to take orders.â€

â€œTo the Catholic Church?â€

â€œThe Catholic Church? what Church else?â€ said the young lady. â€œBut I
forgot--they told me you are a heretic. Is that true, Mr. Osbaldistone?â€

â€œI must not deny the charge.â€

â€œAnd yet you have been abroad, and in Catholic countries?â€

â€œFor nearly four years.â€

â€œYou have seen convents?â€

â€œOften; but I have not seen much in them which recommended the Catholic
religion.â€

â€œAre not the inhabitants happy?â€

â€œSome are unquestionably so, whom either a profound sense of devotion, or
an experience of the persecutions and misfortunes of the world, or a
natural apathy of temper, has led into retirement. Those who have adopted
a life of seclusion from sudden and overstrained enthusiasm, or in hasty
resentment of some disappointment or mortification, are very miserable.
The quickness of sensation soon returns, and like the wilder animals in a
menagerie, they are restless under confinement, while others muse or
fatten in cells of no larger dimensions than theirs.â€

â€œAnd what,â€ continued Miss Vernon, â€œbecomes of those victims who are
condemned to a convent by the will of others? what do they resemble?
especially, what do they resemble, if they are born to enjoy life, and
feel its blessings?â€

â€œThey are like imprisoned singing-birds,â€ replied I, â€œcondemned to wear
out their lives in confinement, which they try to beguile by the exercise
of accomplishments which would have adorned society had they been left at
large.â€

â€œI shall be,â€ returned Miss Vernon--â€œthat is,â€ said she, correcting
herself--â€œI should be rather like the wild hawk, who, barred the free
exercise of his soar through heaven, will dash himself to pieces against
the bars of his cage. But to return to Rashleigh,â€ said she, in a more
lively tone, â€œyou will think him the pleasantest man you ever saw in your
life, Mr. Osbaldistone,--that is, for a week at least. If he could find
out a blind mistress, never man would be so secure of conquest; but the
eye breaks the spell that enchants the ear.--But here we are in the court
of the old hall, which looks as wild and old-fashioned as any of its
inmates. There is no great toilette kept at Osbaldistone Hall, you must
know; but I must take off these things, they are so unpleasantly
warm,--and the hat hurts my forehead, too,â€ continued the lively girl,
taking it off, and shaking down a profusion of sable ringlets, which,
half laughing, half blushing, she separated with her white slender
fingers, in order to clear them away from her beautiful face and
piercing hazel eyes. If there was any coquetry in the action, it was
well disguised by the careless indifference of her manner. I could not
help saying, â€œthat, judging of the family from what I saw, I should
suppose the toilette a very unnecessary care.â€

â€œThatâ€™s very politely said--though, perhaps, I ought not to understand in
what sense it was meant,â€ replied Miss Vernon; â€œbut you will see a better
apology for a little negligence when you meet the Orsons you are to live
amongst, whose forms no toilette could improve. But, as I said before,
the old dinner-bell will clang, or rather clank, in a few minutes--it
cracked of its own accord on the day of the landing of King Willie, and
my uncle, respecting its prophetic talent, would never permit it to be
mended. So do you hold my palfrey, like a duteous knight, until I send
some more humble squire to relieve you of the charge.â€

She threw me the rein as if we had been acquainted from our childhood,
jumped from her saddle, tripped across the courtyard, and entered at a
side-door, leaving me in admiration of her beauty, and astonished with
the over-frankness of her manners, which seemed the more extraordinary at
a time when the dictates of politeness, flowing from the court of the
Grand Monarque Louis XIV., prescribed to the fair sex an unusual severity
of decorum. I was left awkwardly enough stationed in the centre of the
court of the old hall, mounted on one horse, and holding another in my
hand.

The building afforded little to interest a stranger, had I been disposed
to consider it attentively; the sides of the quadrangle were of various
architecture, and with their stone-shafted latticed windows, projecting
turrets, and massive architraves, resembled the inside of a convent, or
of one of the older and less splendid colleges of Oxford. I called for a
domestic, but was for some time totally unattended to; which was the more
provoking, as I could perceive I was the object of curiosity to several
servants, both male and female, from different parts of the building, who
popped out their heads and withdrew them, like rabbits in a warren,
before I could make a direct appeal to the attention of any individual.
The return of the huntsmen and hounds relieved me from my embarrassment,
and with some difficulty I got one down to relieve me of the charge of
the horses, and another stupid boor to guide me to the presence of Sir
Hildebrand. This service he performed with much such grace and good-will,
as a peasant who is compelled to act as guide to a hostile patrol; and in
the same manner I was obliged to guard against his deserting me in the
labyrinth of low vaulted passages which conducted to â€œStun Hall,â€ as he
called it, where I was to be introduced to the gracious presence of my
uncle.

We did, however, at length reach a long vaulted room, floored with stone,
where a range of oaken tables, of a weight and size too massive ever to
be moved aside, were already covered for dinner. This venerable
apartment, which had witnessed the feasts of several generations of the
Osbaldistone family, bore also evidence of their success in field sports.
Huge antlers of deer, which might have been trophies of the hunting of
Chevy Chace, were ranged around the walls, interspersed with the stuffed
skins of badgers, otters, martins, and other animals of the chase. Amidst
some remnants of old armour, which had, perhaps, served against the
Scotch, hung the more valued weapons of silvan war, cross-bows, guns of
various device and construction, nets, fishing-rods, otter-spears,
hunting-poles, with many other singular devices, and engines for taking
or killing game. A few old pictures, dimmed with smoke, and stained with
March beer, hung on the walls, representing knights and ladies, honoured,
doubtless, and renowned in their day; those frowning fearfully from huge
bushes of wig and of beard; and these looking delightfully with all their
might at the roses which they brandished in their hands.

I had just time to give a glance at these matters, when about twelve
blue-coated servants burst into the hall with much tumult and talk, each
rather employed in directing his comrades than in discharging his own
duty. Some brought blocks and billets to the fire, which roared, blazed,
and ascended, half in smoke, half in flame, up a huge tunnel, with an
opening wide enough to accommodate a stone seat within its ample vault,
and which was fronted, by way of chimney-piece, with a huge piece of
heavy architecture, where the monsters of heraldry, embodied by the art
of some Northumbrian chisel, grinned and ramped in red free-stone, now
japanned by the smoke of centuries. Others of these old-fashioned
serving-men bore huge smoking dishes, loaded with substantial fare;
others brought in cups, flagons, bottles, yea barrels of liquor. All
tramped, kicked, plunged, shouldered, and jostled, doing as little
service with as much tumult as could well be imagined. At length, while
the dinner was, after various efforts, in the act of being arranged upon
the board, â€œthe clamour much of men and dogs,â€ the cracking of whips,
calculated for the intimidation of the latter, voices loud and high,
steps which, impressed by the heavy-heeled boots of the period, clattered
like those in the statue of the _Festin de Pierre,_ announced the
arrival of those for whose benefit the preparations were made.

The hubbub among the servants rather increased than diminished as this
crisis approached. Some called to make haste,--others to take
time,--some exhorted to stand out of the way, and make room for Sir
Hildebrand and the young squires,--some to close round the table and be
_in_ the way,--some bawled to open, some to shut, a pair of
folding-doors which divided the hall from a sort of gallery, as I
afterwards learned, or withdrawing-room, fitted up with black wainscot.
Opened the doors were at length, and in rushed curs and men,--eight
dogs, the domestic chaplain, the village doctor, my six cousins, and my
uncle.





CHAPTER SIXTH.


                The rude hall rocks--they come, they come,--
                   The din of voices shakes the dome;--
                In stalk the various forms, and, drest
                   In varying morion, varying vest,
       All march with haughty step--all proudly shake the crest.
                                               Penrose.

If Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone was in no hurry to greet his nephew, of
whose arrival he must have been informed for some time, he had important
avocations to allege in excuse. â€œHad seen thee sooner, lad,â€ he
exclaimed, after a rough shake of the hand, and a hearty welcome to
Osbaldistone Hall, â€œbut had to see the hounds kennelled first. Thou art
welcome to the Hall, lad--here is thy cousin Percie, thy cousin Thornie,
and thy cousin John--your cousin Dick, your cousin Wilfred, and--stay,
whereâ€™s Rashleigh?--ay, hereâ€™s Rashleigh--take thy long body aside
Thornie, and letâ€™s see thy brother a bit--your cousin Rashleigh. So, thy
father has thought on the old Hall, and old Sir Hildebrand at
last--better late than never--Thou art welcome, lad, and thereâ€™s enough.
Whereâ€™s my little Die?--ay, here she comes--this is my niece Die, my
wifeâ€™s brotherâ€™s daughter--the prettiest girl in our dales, be the other
who she may--and so now letâ€™s to the sirloin.â€--

To gain some idea of the person who held this language, you must suppose,
my dear Tresham, a man aged about sixty, in a hunting suit which had once
been richly laced, but whose splendour had been tarnished by many a
November and December storm. Sir Hildebrand, notwithstanding the
abruptness of his present manner, had, at one period of his life, known
courts and camps; had held a commission in the army which encamped on
Hounslow Heath previous to the Revolution--and, recommended perhaps by
his religion, had been knighted about the same period by the unfortunate
and ill-advised James II. But the Knightâ€™s dreams of further preferment,
if he ever entertained any, had died away at the crisis which drove his
patron from the throne, and since that period he had spent a sequestered
life upon his native domains. Notwithstanding his rusticity, however, Sir
Hildebrand retained much of the exterior of a gentleman, and appeared
among his sons as the remains of a Corinthian pillar, defaced and
overgrown with moss and lichen, might have looked, if contrasted with the
rough unhewn masses of upright stones in Stonhenge, or any other
Druidical temple. The sons were, indeed, heavy unadorned blocks as the
eye would desire to look upon. Tall, stout, and comely, all and each of
the five eldest seemed to want alike the Promethean fire of intellect,
and the exterior grace and manner, which, in the polished world,
sometimes supply mental deficiency. Their most valuable moral quality
seemed to be the good-humour and content which was expressed in their
heavy features, and their only pretence to accomplishment was their
dexterity in field sports, for which alone they lived. The strong Gyas,
and the strong Cloanthus, are not less distinguished by the poet, than
the strong Percival, the strong Thorncliff, the strong John, Richard, and
Wilfred Osbaldistones, were by outward appearance.

But, as if to indemnify herself for a uniformity so uncommon in her
productions, Dame Nature had rendered Rashleigh Osbaldistone a striking
contrast in person and manner, and, as I afterwards learned, in temper
and talents, not only to his brothers, but to most men whom I had
hitherto met with. When Percie, Thornie, and Co. had respectively nodded,
grinned, and presented their shoulder rather than their hand, as their
father named them to their new kinsman, Rashleigh stepped forward, and
welcomed me to Osbaldistone Hall, with the air and manner of a man of the
world. His appearance was not in itself prepossessing. He was of low
stature, whereas all his brethren seemed to be descendants of Anak; and
while they were handsomely formed, Rashleigh, though strong in person,
was bull-necked and cross-made, and from some early injury in his youth
had an imperfection in his gait, so much resembling an absolute halt,
that many alleged that it formed the obstacle to his taking orders; the
Church of Rome, as is well known, admitting none to the clerical
profession who labours under any personal deformity. Others, however,
ascribed this unsightly defect to a mere awkward habit, and contended
that it did not amount to a personal disqualification from holy orders.

The features of Rashleigh were such, as, having looked upon, we in vain
wish to banish from our memory, to which they recur as objects of painful
curiosity, although we dwell upon them with a feeling of dislike, and
even of disgust. It was not the actual plainness of his face, taken
separately from the meaning, which made this strong impression. His
features were, indeed, irregular, but they were by no means vulgar; and
his keen dark eyes, and shaggy eyebrows, redeemed his face from the
charge of commonplace ugliness. But there was in these eyes an expression
of art and design, and, on provocation, a ferocity tempered by caution,
which nature had made obvious to the most ordinary physiognomist, perhaps
with the same intention that she has given the rattle to the poisonous
snake. As if to compensate him for these disadvantages of exterior,
Rashleigh Osbaldistone was possessed of a voice the most soft, mellow,
and rich in its tones that I ever heard, and was at no loss for language
of every sort suited to so fine an organ. His first sentence of welcome
was hardly ended, ere I internally agreed with Miss Vernon, that my new
kinsman would make an instant conquest of a mistress whose ears alone
were to judge his cause. He was about to place himself beside me at
dinner, but Miss Vernon, who, as the only female in the family, arranged
all such matters according to her own pleasure, contrived that I should
sit betwixt Thorncliff and herself; and it can scarce be doubted that I
favoured this more advantageous arrangement.

â€œI want to speak with you,â€ she said, â€œand I have placed honest Thornie
betwixt Rashleigh and you on purpose. He will be like--

                    Feather-bed â€˜twixt castle wall
                    And heavy brunt of cannon ball,

while I, your earliest acquaintance in this intellectual family, ask of
you how you like us all?â€

â€œA very comprehensive question, Miss Vernon, considering how short while
I have been at Osbaldistone Hall.â€

â€œOh, the philosophy of our family lies on the surface--there are minute
shades distinguishing the individuals, which require the eye of an
intelligent observer; but the species, as naturalists I believe call it,
may be distinguished and characterized at once.â€

â€œMy five elder cousins, then, are I presume of pretty nearly the same
character.â€

â€œYes, they form a happy compound of sot, gamekeeper, bully, horse-jockey,
and fool; but as they say there cannot be found two leaves on the same
tree exactly alike, so these happy ingredients, being mingled in somewhat
various proportions in each individual, make an agreeable variety for
those who like to study character.â€

â€œGive me a sketch, if you please, Miss Vernon.â€

â€œYou shall have them all in a family-piece, at full length--the favour is
too easily granted to be refused. Percie, the son and heir, has more of
the sot than of the gamekeeper, bully, horse-jockey, or fool--My precious
Thornie is more of the bully than the sot, gamekeeper, jockey, or
fool--John, who sleeps whole weeks amongst the hills, has most of the
gamekeeper--The jockey is powerful with Dickon, who rides two hundred
miles by day and night to be bought and sold at a horse-race--And the
fool predominates so much over Wilfredâ€™s other qualities, that he may be
termed a fool positive.â€

â€œA goodly collection, Miss Vernon, and the individual varieties belong to
a most interesting species. But is there no room on the canvas for Sir
Hildebrand?â€

â€œI love my uncle,â€ was her reply: â€œI owe him some kindness (such it was
meant for at least), and I will leave you to draw his picture yourself,
when you know him better.â€

â€œCome,â€ thought I to myself, â€œI am glad there is some forbearance. After
all, who would have looked for such bitter satire from a creature so
young, and so exquisitely beautiful?â€

â€œYou are thinking of me,â€ she said, bending her dark eyes on me, as if
she meant to pierce through my very soul.

â€œI certainly was,â€ I replied, with some embarrassment at the determined
suddenness of the question, and then, endeavouring to give a
complimentary turn to my frank avowal--â€œHow is it possible I should think
of anything else, seated as I have the happiness to be?â€

She smiled with such an expression of concentrated haughtiness as she
alone could have thrown into her countenance. â€œI must inform you at once,
Mr. Osbaldistone, that compliments are entirely lost upon me; do not,
therefore, throw away your pretty sayings--they serve fine gentlemen who
travel in the country, instead of the toys, beads, and bracelets, which
navigators carry to propitiate the savage inhabitants of newly-discovered
lands. Do not exhaust your stock in trade;--you will find natives in
Northumberland to whom your fine things will recommend you--on me they
would be utterly thrown away, for I happen to know their real value.â€

I was silenced and confounded.

â€œYou remind me at this moment,â€ said the young lady, resuming her lively
and indifferent manner, â€œof the fairy tale, where the man finds all the
money which he had carried to market suddenly changed into pieces of
slate. I have cried down and ruined your whole stock of complimentary
discourse by one unlucky observation. But come, never mind it--You are
belied, Mr. Osbaldistone, unless you have much better conversation than
these _fadeurs,_ which every gentleman with a toupet thinks himself
obliged to recite to an unfortunate girl, merely because she is dressed
in silk and gauze, while he wears superfine cloth with embroidery. Your
natural paces, as any of my five cousins might say, are far preferable to
your complimentary amble. Endeavour to forget my unlucky sex; call me Tom
Vernon, if you have a mind, but speak to me as you would to a friend and
companion; you have no idea how much I shall like you.â€

â€œThat would be a bribe indeed,â€ returned I.

â€œAgain!â€ replied Miss Vernon, holding up her finger; â€œI told you I would
not bear the shadow of a compliment. And now, when you have pledged my
uncle, who threatens you with what he calls a brimmer, I will tell you
what you think of me.â€

The bumper being pledged by me, as a dutiful nephew, and some other
general intercourse of the table having taken place, the continued and
business-like clang of knives and forks, and the devotion of cousin
Thorncliff on my right hand, and cousin Dickon, who sate on Miss Vernonâ€™s
left, to the huge quantities of meat with which they heaped their plates,
made them serve as two occasional partitions, separating us from the rest
of the company, and leaving us to our _tete-a-tete._ â€œAnd now,â€ said
I, â€œgive me leave to ask you frankly, Miss Vernon, what you suppose I am
thinking of you!--I could tell you what I really _do_ think, but you have
interdicted praise.â€

â€œI do not want your assistance. I am conjuror enough to tell your
thoughts without it. You need not open the casement of your bosom; I see
through it. You think me a strange bold girl, half coquette, half romp;
desirous of attracting attention by the freedom of her manners and
loudness of her conversation, because she is ignorant of what the
Spectator calls the softer graces of the sex; and perhaps you think I
have some particular plan of storming you into admiration. I should be
sorry to shock your self-opinion, but you were never more mistaken. All
the confidence I have reposed in you, I would have given as readily to
your father, if I thought he could have understood me. I am in this happy
family as much secluded from intelligent listeners as Sancho in the
Sierra Morena, and when opportunity offers, I must speak or die. I assure
you I would not have told you a word of all this curious intelligence,
had I cared a pin who knew it or knew it not.â€

â€œIt is very cruel in you, Miss Vernon, to take away all particular marks
of favour from your communications, but I must receive them on your own
terms.--You have not included Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone in your domestic
sketches.â€

She shrunk, I thought, at this remark, and hastily answered, in a much
lower tone, â€œNot a word of Rashleigh! His ears are so acute when his
selfishness is interested, that the sounds would reach him even through
the mass of Thorncliffâ€™s person, stuffed as it is with beef,
venison-pasty, and pudding.â€

â€œYes,â€ I replied; â€œbut peeping past the living screen which divides us,
before I put the question, I perceived that Mr. Rashleighâ€™s chair was
empty--he has left the table.â€

â€œI would not have you be too sure of that,â€ Miss Vernon replied. â€œTake my
advice, and when you speak of Rashleigh, get up to the top of
Otterscope-hill, where you can see for twenty miles round you in every
direction--stand on the very peak, and speak in whispers; and, after all,
donâ€™t be too sure that the bird of the air will not carry the matter,
Rashleigh has been my tutor for four years; we are mutually tired of each
other, and we shall heartily rejoice at our approaching separation.â€

â€œMr. Rashleigh leaves Osbaldistone Hall, then?â€

â€œYes, in a few days;--did you not know that?--your father must keep his
resolutions much more secret than Sir Hildebrand. Why, when my uncle was
informed that you were to be his guest for some time, and that your
father desired to have one of his hopeful sons to fill up the lucrative
situation in his counting-house which was vacant by your obstinacy, Mr.
Francis, the good knight held a _cour pleâ€™nieâ€™re_ of all his family,
including the butler, housekeeper, and gamekeeper. This reverend assembly
of the peers and household officers of Osbaldistone Hall was not
convoked, as you may suppose, to elect your substitute, because, as
Rashleigh alone possessed more arithmetic than was necessary to calculate
the odds on a fighting cock, none but he could be supposed qualified for
the situation. But some solemn sanction was necessary for transforming
Rashleighâ€™s destination from starving as a Catholic priest to thriving as
a wealthy banker; and it was not without some reluctance that the
acquiescence of the assembly was obtained to such an act of degradation.â€

â€œI can conceive the scruples--but how were they got over?â€

â€œBy the general wish, I believe, to get Rashleigh out of the house,â€
 replied Miss Vernon. â€œAlthough youngest of the family, he has somehow or
other got the entire management of all the others; and every one is
sensible of the subjection, though they cannot shake it off. If any one
opposes him, he is sure to rue having done so before the year goes about;
and if you do him a very important service, you may rue it still more.â€

â€œAt that rate,â€ answered I, smiling, â€œI should look about me; for I have
been the cause, however unintentionally, of his change of situation.â€

â€œYes; and whether he regards it as an advantage or disadvantage, he will
owe you a grudge for it--But here comes cheese, radishes, and a bumper to
church and king, the hint for chaplains and ladies to disappear; and I,
the sole representative of womanhood at Osbaldistone Hall, retreat, as in
duty bound.â€

She vanished as she spoke, leaving me in astonishment at the mingled
character of shrewdness, audacity, and frankness, which her conversation
displayed. I despair conveying to you the least idea of her manner,
although I have, as nearly as I can remember, imitated her language. In
fact, there was a mixture of untaught simplicity, as well as native
shrewdness and haughty boldness, in her manner, and all were modified and
recommended by the play of the most beautiful features I had ever beheld.
It is not to be thought that, however strange and uncommon I might think
her liberal and unreserved communications, a young man of two-and-twenty
was likely to be severely critical on a beautiful girl of eighteen, for
not observing a proper distance towards him. On the contrary, I was
equally diverted and flattered by Miss Vernonâ€™s confidence, and that
notwithstanding her declaration of its being conferred on me solely
because I was the first auditor who occurred, of intelligence enough to
comprehend it. With the presumption of my age, certainly not diminished
by my residence in France, I imagined that well-formed features, and a
handsome person, both which I conceived myself to possess, were not
unsuitable qualifications for the confidant of a young beauty. My vanity
thus enlisted in Miss Vernonâ€™s behalf, I was far from judging her with
severity, merely for a frankness which I supposed was in some degree
justified by my own personal merit; and the feelings of partiality, which
her beauty, and the singularity of her situation, were of themselves
calculated to excite, were enhanced by my opinion of her penetration and
judgment in her choice of a friend.

After Miss Vernon quitted the apartment, the bottle circulated, or rather
flew, around the table in unceasing revolution. My foreign education had
given me a distaste to intemperance, then and yet too common a vice among
my countrymen. The conversation which seasoned such orgies was as little
to my taste, and if anything could render it more disgusting, it was the
relationship of the company. I therefore seized a lucky opportunity, and
made my escape through a side door, leading I knew not whither, rather
than endure any longer the sight of father and sons practising the same
degrading intemperance, and holding the same coarse and disgusting
conversation. I was pursued, of course, as I had expected, to be
reclaimed by force, as a deserter from the shrine of Bacchus. When I
heard the whoop and hollo, and the tramp of the heavy boots of my
pursuers on the winding stair which I was descending, I plainly foresaw I
should be overtaken unless I could get into the open air. I therefore
threw open a casement in the staircase, which looked into an
old-fashioned garden, and as the height did not exceed six feet, I jumped
out without hesitation, and soon heard far behind the â€œhey whoop! stole
away! stole away!â€ of my baffled pursuers. I ran down one alley, walked
fast up another; and then, conceiving myself out of all danger of
pursuit, I slackened my pace into a quiet stroll, enjoying the cool air
which the heat of the wine I had been obliged to swallow, as well as that
of my rapid retreat, rendered doubly grateful.

As I sauntered on, I found the gardener hard at his evening employment,
and saluted him, as I paused to look at his work.

â€œGood even, my friend.â€

â€œGude eâ€™en--gude eâ€™en tâ€™ye,â€ answered the man, without looking up, and in
a tone which at once indicated his northern extraction.

â€œFine weather for your work, my friend.â€

â€œItâ€™s no that muckle to be compleened oâ€™,â€ answered the man, with that
limited degree of praise which gardeners and farmers usually bestow on
the very best weather. Then raising his head, as if to see who spoke to
him, he touched his Scotch bonnet with an air of respect, as he observed,
â€œEh, gude safe us!--itâ€™s a sight for sair een, to see a gold-laced
jeistiecor in the Haâ€™garden sae late at eâ€™en.â€

â€œA gold-laced what, my good friend?â€

â€œOu, a jeistiecor--thatâ€™s a jacket like your ain, there. They

hae other things to do wiâ€™ them up yonder--unbuttoning them to make room
for the beef and the bag-puddings, and the claret-wine, nae doubt--thatâ€™s
the ordinary for evening lecture on this side the border.â€

â€œThereâ€™s no such plenty of good cheer in your country, my good friend,â€ I
replied, â€œas to tempt you to sit so late at it.â€

â€œHout, sir, ye ken little about Scotland; itâ€™s no for want of gude
vivers--the best of fish, flesh, and fowl hae we, by sybos, ingans,
turneeps, and other garden fruit. But we hae mense and discretion, and
are moderate of our mouths;--but here, frae the kitchen to the haâ€™, itâ€™s
fill and fetch mair, frae the tae end of the four-and-twenty till the
tother. Even their fast days--they caâ€™ it fasting when they hae the best
oâ€™ sea-fish frae Hartlepool and Sunderland by land carriage, forbye
trouts, grilses, salmon, and aâ€™ the lave oâ€™t, and so they make their very
fasting a kind of luxury and abomination; and then the awfuâ€™ masses and
matins of the puir deceived souls--But I shouldna speak about them, for
your honour will be a Roman, Iâ€™se warrant, like the lave.â€

â€œNot I, my friend; I was bred an English presbyterian, or dissenter.â€

â€œThe right hand of fellowship to your honour, then,â€ quoth the gardener,
with as much alacrity as his hard features were capable of expressing,
and, as if to show that his good-will did not rest on words, he plucked
forth a huge horn snuff-box, or mull, as he called it, and proffered a
pinch with a most fraternal grin.

Having accepted his courtesy, I asked him if he had been long a domestic
at Osbaldistone Hall.

â€œI have been fighting with wild beasts at Ephesus,â€ said he, looking
towards the building, â€œfor the best part of these four-and-twenty years,
as sure as my nameâ€™s Andrew Fairservice.â€

â€œBut, my excellent friend, Andrew Fairservice, if your religion and your
temperance are so much offended by Roman rituals and southern
hospitality, it seems to me that you must have been putting yourself to
an unnecessary penance all this while, and that you might have found a
service where they eat less, and are more orthodox in their worship. I
dare say it cannot be want of skill which prevented your being placed
more to your satisfaction.â€

â€œIt disna become me to speak to the point of my qualifications,â€ said
Andrew, looking round him with great complacency; â€œbut nae doubt I should
understand my trade of horticulture, seeing I was bred in the parish of
Dreepdaily, where they raise lang-kale under glass, and force the early
nettles for their spring kale. And, to speak truth, I hae been flitting
every term these four-and-twenty years; but when the time comes, thereâ€™s
aye something to saw that I would like to see sawn,--or something to maw
that I would like to see mawn,--or something to ripe that I would like to
see ripen,--and sae I eâ€™en daiker on wiâ€™ the family frae yearâ€™s end to
yearâ€™s end. And I wad say for certain, that I am gaun to quit at
Cannlemas, only I was just as positive on it twenty years syne, and I
find mysell still turning up the mouls here, for aâ€™ that. Forbye that, to
tell your honour the evendown truth, thereâ€™s nae better place ever
offered to Andrew. But if your honour wad wush me to ony place where I
wad hear pure doctrine, and hae a free cowâ€™s grass, and a cot, and a
yard, and mair than ten punds of annual fee, and where thereâ€™s nae leddy
about the town to count the apples, Iâ€™se hold mysell muckle indebted
tâ€™ye.â€

â€œBravo, Andrew! I perceive youâ€™ll lose no preferment for want of asking
patronage.â€

â€œI canna see what for I should,â€ replied Andrew; â€œitâ€™s no a generation to
wait till aneâ€™s worthâ€™s discovered, I trow.â€

â€œBut you are no friend, I observe, to the ladies.â€

â€œNa, by my troth, I keep up the first gardenerâ€™s quarrel to them. Theyâ€™re
fasheous bargains--aye crying for apricocks, pears, plums, and apples,
summer and winter, without distinction oâ€™ seasons; but we hae nae slices
oâ€™ the spare rib here, be praised forâ€™t! except auld Martha, and sheâ€™s
weel eneugh pleased wiâ€™ the freedom oâ€™ the berry-bushes to her sisterâ€™s
weans, when they come to drink tea in a holiday in the housekeeperâ€™s
room, and wiâ€™ a wheen codlings now and then for her ain private supper.â€

â€œYou forget your young mistress.â€

â€œWhat mistress do I forget?--whaeâ€™s that?â€

â€œYour young mistress, Miss Vernon.â€

â€œWhat! the lassie Vernon?--Sheâ€™s nae mistress oâ€™ mine, man. I wish she
was her ain mistress; and I wish she mayna be some other bodyâ€™s mistress
or itâ€™s lang--Sheâ€™s a wild slip that.â€

â€œIndeed!â€ said I, more interested than I cared to own to myself, or to
show to the fellow--â€œwhy, Andrew, you know all the secrets of this
family.â€

â€œIf I ken them, I can keep them,â€ said Andrew; â€œthey winna work in my
wame like harm in a barrel, Iâ€™se warrant ye. Miss Die is--but itâ€™s
neither beef nor brose oâ€™ mine.â€

And he began to dig with a great semblance of assiduity.

â€œWhat is Miss Vernon, Andrew? I am a friend of the family, and should
like to know.â€

â€œOther than a gude ane, Iâ€™m fearing,â€ said Andrew, closing one eye hard,
and shaking his head with a grave and mysterious look--â€œsomething
gleeâ€™d--your honour understands me?â€

â€œI cannot say I do,â€ said I, â€œAndrew; but I should like to hear you
explain yourself;â€ and therewithal I slipped a crown-piece into Andrewâ€™s
horn-hard hand. The touch of the silver made him grin a ghastly smile, as
he nodded slowly, and thrust it into his breeches pocket; and then, like
a man who well understood that there was value to be returned, stood up,
and rested his arms on his spade, with his features composed into the
most important gravity, as for some serious communication.

â€œYe maun ken, then, young gentleman, since it imports you to know, that
Miss Vernon isâ€--

Here breaking off, he sucked in both his cheeks, till his lantern jaws
and long chin assumed the appearance of a pair of nut-crackers; winked
hard once more, frowned, shook his head, and seemed to think his
physiognomy had completed the information which his tongue had not fully
told.

â€œGood God!â€ said I--â€œso young, so beautiful, so early lost!â€

â€œTroth ye may say sae--sheâ€™s in a manner lost, body and saul; forby being
a Papist, Iâ€™se uphaud her forâ€--and his northern caution prevailed, and
he was again silent.

â€œFor what, sir?â€ said I sternly. â€œI insist on knowing the plain meaning
of all this.â€

â€œOn, just for the bitterest Jacobite in the haill shire.â€

â€œPshaw! a Jacobite?--is that all?â€

Andrew looked at me with some astonishment, at hearing his information
treated so lightly; and then muttering, â€œAweel, itâ€™s the warst thing I
ken aboot the lassie, howsoeâ€™er,â€ he resumed his spade, like the king of
the Vandals, in Marmontelâ€™s late novel.





CHAPTER SEVENTH.

    _Bardolph._--The sheriff, with a monstrous watch, is at the door.
                          Henry IV. _First Part._

I found out with some difficulty the apartment which was destined for my
accommodation; and having secured myself the necessary good-will and
attention from my uncleâ€™s domestics, by using the means they were most
capable of comprehending, I secluded myself there for the remainder of
the evening, conjecturing, from the fair way in which I had left my new
relatives, as well as from the distant noise which continued to echo from
the stone-hall (as their banqueting-room was called), that they were not
likely to be fitting company for a sober man.

â€œWhat could my father mean by sending me to be an inmate in this strange
family?â€ was my first and most natural reflection. My uncle, it was
plain, received me as one who was to make some stay with him, and his
rude hospitality rendered him as indifferent as King Hal to the number of
those who fed at his cost. But it was plain my presence or absence would
be of as little importance in his eyes as that of one of his blue-coated
serving-men. My cousins were mere cubs, in whose company I might, if I
liked it, unlearn whatever decent manners, or elegant accomplishments, I
had acquired, but where I could attain no information beyond what
regarded worming dogs, rowelling horses, and following foxes. I could
only imagine one reason, which was probably the true one. My father
considered the life which was led at Osbaldistone Hall as the natural and
inevitable pursuits of all country gentlemen, and he was desirous, by
giving me an opportunity of seeing that with which he knew I should be
disgusted, to reconcile me, if possible, to take an active share in his
own business. In the meantime, he would take Rashleigh Osbaldistone into
the counting-house. But he had an hundred modes of providing for him, and
that advantageously, whenever he chose to get rid of him. So that,
although I did feel a certain qualm of conscience at having been the
means of introducing Rashleigh, being such as he was described by Miss
Vernon, into my fatherâ€™s business--perhaps into his confidence--I subdued
it by the reflection that my father was complete master of his own
affairs--a man not to be imposed upon, or influenced by any one--and that
all I knew to the young gentlemanâ€™s prejudice was through the medium of a
singular and giddy girl, whose communications were made with an
injudicious frankness, which might warrant me in supposing her
conclusions had been hastily or inaccurately formed. Then my mind
naturally turned to Miss Vernon herself; her extreme beauty; her very
peculiar situation, relying solely upon her reflections, and her own
spirit, for guidance and protection; and her whole character offering
that variety and spirit which piques our curiosity, and engages our
attention in spite of ourselves. I had sense enough to consider the
neighbourhood of this singular young lady, and the chance of our being
thrown into very close and frequent intercourse, as adding to the
dangers, while it relieved the dulness, of Osbaldistone Hall; but I could
not, with the fullest exertion of my prudence, prevail upon myself to
regret excessively this new and particular hazard to which I was to be
exposed. This scruple I also settled as young men settle most
difficulties of the kind--I would be very cautious, always on my guard,
consider Miss Vernon rather as a companion than an intimate; and all
would do well enough. With these reflections I fell asleep, Miss Vernon,
of course, forming the last subject of my contemplation.

Whether I dreamed of her or not, I cannot satisfy you, for I was tired
and slept soundly. But she was the first person I thought of in the
morning, when waked at dawn by the cheerful notes of the hunting horn. To
start up, and direct my horse to be saddled, was my first movement; and
in a few minutes I was in the court-yard, where men, dogs, and horses,
were in full preparation. My uncle, who, perhaps, was not entitled to
expect a very alert sportsman in his nephew, bred as he had been in
foreign parts, seemed rather surprised to see me, and I thought his
morning salutation wanted something of the hearty and hospitable tone
which distinguished his first welcome. â€œArt there, lad?--ay, youthâ€™s aye
rathe--but look to thysell--mind the old song, lad--

             He that gallops his horse on Blackstone edge
                      May chance to catch a fall.â€

I believe there are few young men, and those very sturdy moralists, who
would not rather be taxed with some moral peccadillo than with want of
knowledge in horsemanship. As I was by no means deficient either in skill
or courage, I resented my uncleâ€™s insinuation accordingly, and assured
him he would find me up with the hounds.

â€œI doubtna, lad,â€ was his reply; â€œthouâ€™rt a rank rider, Iâ€™se warrant
thee--but take heed. Thy father sent thee here to me to be bitted, and I
doubt I must ride thee on the curb, or weâ€™ll hae some one to ride thee on
the halter, if I takena the better heed.â€

As this speech was totally unintelligible to me--as, besides, it did not
seem to be delivered for my use, or benefit, but was spoken as it were
aside, and as if expressing aloud something which was passing through the
mind of my much-honoured uncle, I concluded it must either refer to my
desertion of the bottle on the preceding evening, or that my uncleâ€™s
morning hours being a little discomposed by the revels of the night
before, his temper had suffered in proportion. I only made the passing
reflection, that if he played the ungracious landlord, I would remain the
shorter while his guest, and then hastened to salute Miss Vernon, who
advanced cordially to meet me. Some show of greeting also passed between
my cousins and me; but as I saw them maliciously bent upon criticising my
dress and accoutrements, from the cap to the stirrup-irons, and sneering
at whatever had a new or foreign appearance, I exempted myself from the
task of paying them much attention; and assuming, in requital of their
grins and whispers, an air of the utmost indifference and contempt, I
attached myself to Miss Vernon, as the only person in the party whom I
could regard as a suitable companion. By her side, therefore, we sallied
forth to the destined cover, which was a dingle or copse on the side of
an extensive common. As we rode thither, I observed to Diana, â€œthat I did
not see my cousin Rashleigh in the field;â€ to which she replied,--â€œO
no--heâ€™s a mighty hunter, but itâ€™s after the fashion of Nimrod, and his
game is man.â€

The dogs now brushed into the cover, with the appropriate encouragement
from the hunters--all was business, bustle, and activity. My cousins were
soon too much interested in the business of the morning to take any
further notice of me, unless that I overheard Dickon the horse-jockey
whisper to Wilfred the fool--â€œLook thou, an our French cousin be nat off
aâ€™ first burst.â€

To which Wilfred answered, â€œLike enow, for he has a queer outlandish
binding onâ€™s castor.â€

Thorncliff, however, who in his rude way seemed not absolutely insensible
to the beauty of his kinswoman, appeared determined to keep us company
more closely than his brothers,--perhaps to watch what passed betwixt
Miss Vernon and me--perhaps to enjoy my expected mishaps in the chase. In
the last particular he was disappointed. After beating in vain for the
greater part of the morning, a fox was at length found, who led us a
chase of two hours, in the course of which, notwithstanding the
ill-omened French binding upon my hat, I sustained my character as a
horseman to the admiration of my uncle and Miss Vernon, and the secret
disappointment of those who expected me to disgrace it. Reynard, however,
proved too wily for his pursuers, and the hounds were at fault. I could
at this time observe in Miss Vernonâ€™s manner an impatience of the close
attendance which we received from Thorncliff Osbaldistone; and, as that
active-spirited young lady never hesitated at taking the readiest means
to gratify any wish of the moment, she said to him, in a tone of
reproach--â€œI wonder, Thornie, what keeps you dangling at my horseâ€™s
crupper all this morning, when you know the earths above Woolverton-mill
are not stopt.â€

â€œI know no such an thing then, Miss Die, for the miller swore himself as
black as night, that he stopt them at twelve oâ€™clock midnight that was.â€

â€œO fie upon you, Thornie! would you trust to a millerâ€™s word?--and these
earths, too, where we lost the fox three times this season! and you on
your grey mare, that can gallop there and back in ten minutes!â€

â€œWell, Miss Die, Iâ€™se go to Woolverton then, and if the earths are not
stopt, Iâ€™se raddle Dick the millerâ€™s bones for him.â€

â€œDo, my dear Thornie; horsewhip the rascal to purpose--via--fly away, and
about it;â€--Thorncliff went off at the gallop--â€œor get horsewhipt
yourself, which will serve my purpose just as well.--I must teach them
all discipline and obedience to the word of command. I am raising a
regiment, you must know. Thornie shall be my sergeant-major, Dickon my
riding-master, and Wilfred, with his deep dub-a-dub tones, that speak but
three syllables at a time, my kettle-drummer.â€

â€œAnd Rashleigh?â€

â€œRashleigh shall be my scout-master.â€ â€œAnd will you find no employment
for me, most lovely colonel?â€

â€œYou shall have the choice of being pay-master, or plunder-master, to the
corps. But see how the dogs puzzle about there. Come, Mr. Frank, the
scentâ€™s cold; they wonâ€™t recover it there this while; follow me, I have a
view to show you.â€

And in fact, she cantered up to the top of a gentle hill, commanding an
extensive prospect. Casting her eyes around, to see that no one was near
us, she drew up her horse beneath a few birch-trees, which screened us
from the rest of the hunting-field--â€œDo you see yon peaked, brown, heathy
hill, having something like a whitish speck upon the side?â€

â€œTerminating that long ridge of broken moorish uplands?--I see it
distinctly.â€

â€œThat whitish speck is a rock called Hawkesmore-crag, and Hawkesmore-crag
is in Scotland.â€

â€œIndeed! I did not think we had been so near Scotland.â€

â€œIt is so, I assure you, and your horse will carry you there in two
hours.â€

â€œI shall hardly give him the trouble; why, the distance must be eighteen
miles as the crow flies.â€

â€œYou may have my mare, if you think her less blown--I say, that in two
hours you may be in Scotland.â€

â€œAnd I say, that I have so little desire to be there, that if my horseâ€™s
head were over the Border, I would not give his tail the trouble of
following. What should I do in Scotland?â€

â€œProvide for your safety, if I must speak plainly. Do you understand me
now, Mr. Frank?â€

â€œNot a whit; you are more and more oracular.â€

â€œThen, on my word, you either mistrust me most unjustly, and are a better
dissembler than Rashleigh Osbaldistone himself, or you know nothing of
what is imputed to you; and then no wonder you stare at me in that grave
manner, which I can scarce see without laughing.â€

â€œUpon my word of honour, Miss Vernon,â€ said I, with an impatient feeling
of her childish disposition to mirth, â€œI have not the most distant
conception of what you mean. I am happy to afford you any subject of
amusement, but I am quite ignorant in what it consists.â€

â€œNay, thereâ€™s no sound jest after all,â€ said the young lady, composing
herself; â€œonly one looks so very ridiculous when he is fairly perplexed.
But the matter is serious enough. Do you know one Moray, or Morris, or
some such name?â€

â€œNot that I can at present recollect.â€

â€œThink a moment. Did you not lately travel with somebody of such a name?â€

â€œThe only man with whom I travelled for any length of time was a fellow
whose soul seemed to lie in his portmanteau.â€

â€œThen it was like the soul of the licentiate Pedro Garcias, which lay
among the ducats in his leathern purse. That man has been robbed, and he
has lodged an information against you, as connected with the violence
done to him.â€

â€œYou jest, Miss Vernon!â€

â€œI do not, I assure you--the thing is an absolute fact.â€

â€œAnd do you,â€ said I, with strong indignation, which I did not attempt to
suppress, â€œdo you suppose me capable of meriting such a charge?â€

â€œYou would call me out for it, I suppose, had I the advantage of being a
man--You may do so as it is, if you like it--I can shoot flying, as well
as leap a five-barred gate.â€

â€œAnd are colonel of a regiment of horse besides,â€ replied I, reflecting
how idle it was to be angry with her--â€œBut do explain the present jest to
me.â€

â€œThereâ€™s no jest whatever,â€ said Diana; â€œyou are accused of robbing this
man, and my uncle believes it as well as I did.â€

â€œUpon my honour, I am greatly obliged to my friends for their good
opinion!â€

â€œNow do not, if you can help it, snort, and stare, and snuff the wind,
and look so exceedingly like a startled horse--Thereâ€™s no such offence as
you suppose--you are not charged with any petty larceny or vulgar
felony--by no means. This fellow was carrying money from Government, both
specie and bills, to pay the troops in the north; and it is said he has
been also robbed of some despatches of great consequence.â€

â€œAnd so it is high treason, then, and not simple robbery, of which I am
accused!â€

â€œCertainly--which, you know, has been in all ages accounted the crime of
a gentleman. You will find plenty in this country, and one not far from
your elbow, who think it a merit to distress the Hanoverian government by
every means possible.â€

â€œNeither my politics nor my morals, Miss Vernon, are of a description so
accommodating.â€

â€œI really begin to believe that you are a Presbyterian and Hanoverian in
good earnest. But what do you propose to do?â€

â€œInstantly to refute this atrocious calumny.--Before whom,â€ I asked, â€œwas
this extraordinary accusation laid.â€

â€œBefore old Squire Inglewood, who had sufficient unwillingness to receive
it. He sent tidings to my uncle, I suppose, that he might smuggle you
away into Scotland, out of reach of the warrant. But my uncle is sensible
that his religion and old predilections render him obnoxious to
Government, and that, were he caught playing booty, he would be disarmed,
and probably dismounted (which would be the worse evil of the two), as a
Jacobite, papist, and suspected person.â€ 

â€œI can conceive that, sooner than lose his hunters, he would give up his
nephew.â€

â€œHis nephew, nieces, sons--daughters, if he had them, and whole
generation,â€ said Diana;--â€œtherefore trust not to him, even for a single
moment, but make the best of your way before they can serve the warrant.â€

â€œThat I shall certainly do; but it shall be to the house of this Squire
Inglewood--Which way does it lie?â€

â€œAbout five miles off, in the low ground, behind yonder plantations--you
may see the tower of the clock-house.â€

â€œI will be there in a few minutes,â€ said I, putting my horse in motion.

â€œAnd I will go with you, and show you the way,â€ said Diana, putting her
palfrey also to the trot.

â€œDo not think of it, Miss Vernon,â€ I replied. â€œIt is not--permit me the
freedom of a friend--it is not proper, scarcely even delicate, in you to
go with me on such an errand as I am now upon.â€

â€œI understand your meaning,â€ said Miss Vernon, a slight blush crossing
her haughty brow;--â€œit is plainly spoken;â€ and after a momentâ€™s pause she
added, â€œand I believe kindly meant.â€

â€œIt is indeed, Miss Vernon. Can you think me insensible of the interest
you show me, or ungrateful for it?â€ said I, with even more earnestness
than I could have wished to express. â€œYours is meant for true kindness,
shown best at the hour of need. But I must not, for your own sake--for
the chance of misconstruction--suffer you to pursue the dictates of your
generosity; this is so public an occasion--it is almost like venturing
into an open court of justice.â€

â€œAnd if it were not almost, but altogether entering into an open court of
justice, do you think I would not go there if I thought it right, and
wished to protect a friend? You have no one to stand by you--you are a
stranger; and here, in the outskirts of the kingdom, country justices do
odd things. My uncle has no desire to embroil himself in your affair;
Rashleigh is absent, and were he here, there is no knowing which side he
might take; the rest are all more stupid and brutal one than another. I
will go with you, and I do not fear being able to serve you. I am no fine
lady, to be terrified to death with law-books, hard words, or big wigs.â€

â€œBut my dear Miss Vernonâ€--

â€œBut my dear Mr. Francis, be patient and quiet, and let me take my own
way; for when I take the bit between my teeth, there is no bridle will
stop me.â€

Flattered with the interest so lovely a creature seemed to take in my
fate, yet vexed at the ridiculous appearance I should make, by carrying a
girl of eighteen along with me as an advocate, and seriously concerned
for the misconstruction to which her motives might be exposed, I
endeavoured to combat her resolution to accompany me to Squire
Inglewoodâ€™s. The self-willed girl told me roundly, that my dissuasions
were absolutely in vain; that she was a true Vernon, whom no
consideration, not even that of being able to do but little to assist
him, should induce to abandon a friend in distress; and that all I could
say on the subject might be very well for pretty, well-educated,
well-behaved misses from a town boarding-school, but did not apply to
her, who was accustomed to mind nobodyâ€™s opinion but her own.

While she spoke thus, we were advancing hastily towards Inglewood Place,
while, as if to divert me from the task of further remonstrance, she drew
a ludicrous picture of the magistrate and his clerk.--Inglewood
was--according to her description--a white-washed Jacobite; that is, one
who, having been long a non-juror, like most of the other gentlemen of the
country, had lately qualified himself to act as a justice, by taking the
oaths to Government. â€œHe had done so,â€ she said, â€œin compliance with the
urgent request of most of his brother squires, who saw, with regret, that
the palladium of silvan sport, the game-laws, were likely to fall into
disuse for want of a magistrate who would enforce them; the nearest
acting justice being the Mayor of Newcastle, and he, as being rather
inclined to the consumption of the game when properly dressed, than to
its preservation when alive, was more partial, of course, to the cause of
the poacher than of the sportsman. Resolving, therefore, that it was
expedient some one of their number should sacrifice the scruples of
Jacobitical loyalty to the good of the community, the Northumbrian
country gentlemen imposed the duty on Inglewood, who, being very inert in
most of his feelings and sentiments, might, they thought, comply with any
political creed without much repugnance. Having thus procured the body of
justice, they proceeded,â€ continued Miss Vernon, â€œto attach to it a
clerk, by way of soul, to direct and animate its movements. Accordingly
they got a sharp Newcastle attorney, called Jobson, who, to vary my
metaphor, finds it a good thing enough to retail justice at the sign of
Squire Inglewood, and, as his own emoluments depend on the quantity of
business which he transacts, he hooks in his principal for a great deal
more employment in the justice line than the honest squire had ever
bargained for; so that no apple-wife within the circuit of ten miles can
settle her account with a costermonger without an audience of the
reluctant Justice and his alert clerk, Mr. Joseph Jobson. But the most
ridiculous scenes occur when affairs come before him, like our business
of to-day, having any colouring of politics. Mr. Joseph Jobson (for
which, no doubt, he has his own very sufficient reasons) is a prodigious
zealot for the Protestant religion, and a great friend to the present
establishment in church and state. Now, his principal, retaining a sort
of instinctive attachment to the opinions which he professed openly until
he relaxed his political creed with the patriotic view of enforcing the
law against unauthorized destroyers of black-game, grouse, partridges,
and hares, is peculiarly embarrassed when the zeal of his assistant
involves him in judicial proceedings connected with his earlier faith;
and, instead of seconding his zeal, he seldom fails to oppose to it a
double dose of indolence and lack of exertion. And this inactivity does
not by any means arise from actual stupidity. On the contrary, for one
whose principal delight is in eating and drinking, he is an alert,
joyous, and lively old soul, which makes his assumed dulness the more
diverting. So you may see Jobson on such occasions, like a bit of a
broken down blood-tit condemned to drag an overloaded cart, puffing,
strutting, and spluttering, to get the Justice put in motion, while,
though the wheels groan, creak, and revolve slowly, the great and
preponderating weight of the vehicle fairly frustrates the efforts of the
willing quadruped, and prevents its being brought into a state of actual
progression. Nay more, the unfortunate pony, I understand, has been heard
to complain that this same car of justice, which he finds it so hard to
put in motion on some occasions, can on others run fast enough down hill
of its own accord, dragging his reluctant self backwards along with it,
when anything can be done of service to Squire Inglewoodâ€™s quondam
friends. And then Mr. Jobson talks big about reporting his principal to
the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if it were not for his
particular regard and friendship for Mr. Inglewood and his family.â€

As Miss Vernon concluded this whimsical description, we found ourselves
in front of Inglewood Place, a handsome, though old-fashioned building,
which showed the consequence of the family.





CHAPTER EIGHTH.


               â€œSir,â€ quoth the Lawyer, â€œnot to flatter ye,
                   You have as good and fair a battery
                As heart could wish, and need not shame
                   The proudest man alive to claim.â€
                                               Butler.

Our horses were taken by a servant in Sir Hildebrandâ€™s livery, whom we
found in the court-yard, and we entered the house. In the entrance-hall I
was somewhat surprised, and my fair companion still more so, when we met
Rashleigh Osbaldistone, who could not help showing equal wonder at our
rencontre.

â€œRashleigh,â€ said Miss Vernon, without giving him time to ask any
question, â€œyou have heard of Mr. Francis Osbaldistoneâ€™s affair, and you
have been talking to the Justice about it?â€

â€œCertainly,â€ said Rashleigh, composedly--â€œit has been my business here.--
I have been endeavouring,â€ he said, with a bow to me, â€œto render my
cousin what service I can. But I am sorry to meet him here.â€

â€œAs a friend and relation, Mr. Osbaldistone, you ought to have been sorry
to have met me anywhere else, at a time when the charge of my reputation
required me to be on this spot as soon as possible.â€

â€œTrue; but judging from what my father said, I should have supposed a
short retreat into Scotland--just till matters should be smoothed over in
a quiet wayâ€--

I answered with warmth, â€œThat I had no prudential measures to observe,
and desired to have nothing smoothed over;--on the contrary, I was come
to inquire into a rascally calumny, which I was determined to probe to
the bottom.â€

â€œMr. Francis Osbaldistone is an innocent man, Rashleigh,â€ said Miss
Vernon, â€œand he demands an investigation of the charge against him, and I
intend to support him in it.â€

â€œYou do, my pretty cousin?--I should think, now, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone
was likely to be as effectually, and rather more delicately, supported by
my presence than by yours.â€

â€œOh, certainly; but two heads are better than one, you know.â€

â€œEspecially such a head as yours, my pretty Die,â€ advancing and taking
her hand with a familiar fondness, which made me think him fifty times
uglier than nature had made him. She led him, however, a few steps aside;
they conversed in an under voice, and she appeared to insist upon some
request which he was unwilling or unable to comply with. I never saw so
strong a contrast betwixt the expression of two faces. Miss Vernonâ€™s,
from being earnest, became angry; her eyes and cheeks became more
animated, her colour mounted, she clenched her little hand, and stamping
on the ground with her tiny foot, seemed to listen with a mixture of
contempt and indignation to the apologies, which, from his look of civil
deference, his composed and respectful smile, his body rather drawing
back than advanced, and other signs of look and person, I concluded him
to be pouring out at her feet. At length she flung away from him, with â€œI
_will_ have it so.â€

â€œIt is not in my power--there is no possibility of it.--Would you think
it, Mr. Osbaldistone?â€ said he, addressing me--

â€œYou are not mad?â€ said she, interrupting him.

â€œWould you think it?â€ said he, without attending to her hint--â€œMiss
Vernon insists, not only that I know your innocence (of which, indeed, it
is impossible for any one to be more convinced), but that I must also be
acquainted with the real perpetrators of the outrage on this fellow--if
indeed such an outrage has been committed. Is this reasonable, Mr.
Osbaldistone?â€

â€œI will not allow any appeal to Mr. Osbaldistone, Rashleigh,â€ said the
young lady; â€œhe does not know, as I do, the incredible extent and
accuracy of your information on all points.â€

â€œAs I am a gentleman, you do me more honour than I deserve.â€

â€œJustice, Rashleigh--only justice:--and it is only justice which I expect
at your hands.â€

â€œYou are a tyrant, Diana,â€ he answered, with a sort of sigh--â€œa
capricious tyrant, and rule your friends with a rod of iron. Still,
however, it shall be as you desire. But you ought not to be here--you
know you ought not;--you must return with me.â€

Then turning from Diana, who seemed to stand undecided, he came up to me
in the most friendly manner, and said, â€œDo not doubt my interest in what
regards you, Mr. Osbaldistone. If I leave you just at this moment, it is
only to act for your advantage. But you must use your influence with your
cousin to return; her presence cannot serve you, and must prejudice
herself.â€

â€œI assure you, sir,â€ I replied, â€œyou cannot be more convinced of this
than I; I have urged Miss Vernonâ€™s return as anxiously as she would
permit me to do.â€

â€œI have thought on it,â€ said Miss Vernon after a pause, â€œand I will not
go till I see you safe out of the hands of the Philistines. Cousin
Rashleigh, I dare say, means well; but he and I know each other well.
Rashleigh, I will not go;--I know,â€ she added, in a more soothing tone,
â€œmy being here will give you more motive for speed and exertion.â€

â€œStay then, rash, obstinate girl,â€ said Rashleigh; â€œyou know but too well
to whom you trust;â€ and hastening out of the hall, we heard his horseâ€™s
feet a minute afterwards in rapid motion.

â€œThank Heaven he is gone!â€ said Diana. â€œAnd now let us seek out the
Justice.â€

â€œHad we not better call a servant?â€

â€œOh, by no means; I know the way to his den--we must burst on him
suddenly--follow me.â€

I did follow her accordingly, as she tripped up a few gloomy steps,
traversed a twilight passage, and entered a sort of ante-room, hung round
with old maps, architectural elevations, and genealogical trees. A pair
of folding-doors opened from this into Mr. Inglewoodâ€™s sitting apartment,
from which was heard the fag-end of an old ditty, chanted by a voice
which had been in its day fit for a jolly bottle-song.

                       â€œO, in Skipton-in-Craven
                           Is never a haven,
                        But many a day foul weather;
                           And he that would say
                           A pretty girl nay,
                        I wish for his cravat a tether.â€

â€œHeyday!â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œthe genial Justice must have dined
already--I did not think it had been so late.â€

It was even so. Mr. Inglewoodâ€™s appetite having been sharpened by his
official investigations, he had antedated his meridian repast, having
dined at twelve instead of one oâ€™clock, then the general dining hour in
England. The various occurrences of the morning occasioned our arriving
some time after this hour, to the Justice the most important of the
four-and-twenty, and he had not neglected the interval.

â€œStay you here,â€ said Diana. â€œI know the house, and I will call a
servant; your sudden appearance might startle the old gentleman even to
choking;â€ and she escaped from me, leaving me uncertain whether I ought
to advance or retreat. It was impossible for me not to hear some part of
what passed within the dinner apartment, and particularly several
apologies for declining to sing, expressed in a dejected croaking voice,
the tones of which, I conceived, were not entirely new to me.

â€œNot sing, sir? by our Lady! but you must--What! you have cracked my
silver-mounted cocoa-nut of sack, and tell me that you cannot sing!--Sir,
sack will make a cat sing, and speak too; so up with a merry stave, or
trundle yourself out of my doors!--Do you think you are to take up all my
valuable time with your d-d declarations, and then tell me you cannot
sing?â€

â€œYour worship is perfectly in rule,â€ said another voice, which, from its
pert conceited accent, might be that of the cleric, â€œand the party must
be conformable; he hath _canet_ written on his face in court hand.â€

â€œUp with it then,â€ said the Justice, â€œor by St. Christopher, you shall
crack the cocoa-nut full of salt-and-water, according to the statute for
such effect made and provided.â€

Thus exhorted and threatened, my quondam fellow-traveller, for I could no
longer doubt that he was the recusant in question, uplifted, with a voice
similar to that of a criminal singing his last psalm on the scaffold, a
most doleful stave to the following effect:--

                   â€œGood people all, I pray give ear,
                    A woeful story you shall hear,
                   â€˜Tis of a robber as stout as ever
                    Bade a true man stand and deliver.
                       With his foodle doo fa loodle loo.

                   â€œThis knave, most worthy of a cord,
                    Being armed with pistol and with sword,
                   â€˜Twixt Kensington and Brentford then
                    Did boldly stop six honest men.
                       With his foodle doo, etc.

                  â€œThese honest men did at Brentford dine,
                   Having drank each man his pint of wine,
                   When this bold thief, with many curses,
                   Did say, You dogs, your lives or purses.
                       With his foodle doo,â€ etc.

I question if the honest men, whose misfortune is commemorated in this
pathetic ditty, were more startled at the appearance of the bold thief
than the songster was at mine; for, tired of waiting for some one to
announce me, and finding my situation as a listener rather awkward, I
presented myself to the company just as my friend Mr. Morris, for such,
it seems, was his name, was uplifting the fifth stave of his doleful
ballad. The high tone with which the tune started died away in a quaver
of consternation on finding himself so near one whose character he
supposed to be little less suspicious than that of the hero of his
madrigal, and he remained silent, with a mouth gaping as if I had brought
the Gorgonâ€™s head in my hand.

The Justice, whose eyes had closed under the influence of the somniferous
lullaby of the song, started up in his chair as it suddenly ceased, and
stared with wonder at the unexpected addition which the company had
received while his organs of sight were in abeyance. The clerk, as I
conjectured him to be from his appearance, was also commoved; for,
sitting opposite to Mr. Morris, that honest gentlemanâ€™s terror
communicated itself to him, though he wotted not why.

I broke the silence of surprise occasioned by my abrupt entrance.--â€œMy
name, Mr. Inglewood, is Francis Osbaldistone; I understand that some
scoundrel has brought a complaint before you, charging me with being
concerned in a loss which he says he has sustained.â€

â€œSir,â€ said the Justice, somewhat peevishly, â€œthese are matters I never
enter upon after dinner;--there is a time for everything, and a justice
of peace must eat as well as other folks.â€

The goodly person of Mr. Inglewood, by the way, seemed by no means to
have suffered by any fasts, whether in the service of the law or of
religion.

â€œI beg pardon for an ill-timed visit, sir; but as my reputation is
concerned, and as the dinner appears to be concludedâ€--

â€œIt is not concluded, sir,â€ replied the magistrate; â€œman requires
digestion as well as food, and I protest I cannot have benefit from my
victuals unless I am allowed two hours of quiet leisure, intermixed with
harmless mirth, and a moderate circulation of the bottle.â€

â€œIf your honour will forgive me,â€ said Mr. Jobson, who had produced and
arranged his writing implements in the brief space that our conversation
afforded; â€œas this is a case of felony, and the gentleman seems something
impatient, the charge is _contra pacem domini regis_â€--

â€œD--n _dominie regis!_â€ said the impatient Justice--â€œI hope itâ€™s no
treason to say so; but itâ€™s enough to made one mad to be worried in this
way. Have I a moment of my life quiet for warrants, orders, directions,
acts, bails, bonds, and recognisances?--I pronounce to you, Mr. Jobson,
that I shall send you and the justiceship to the devil one of these
days.â€

â€œYour honour will consider the dignity of the office one of the quorum
and custos rotulorum, an office of which Sir Edward Coke wisely saith,
The whole Christian world hath not the like of it, so it be duly
executed.â€

â€œWell,â€ said the Justice, partly reconciled by this eulogium on the
dignity of his situation, and gulping down the rest of his
dissatisfaction in a huge bumper of claret, â€œlet us to this gear then,
and get rid of it as fast as we can.--Here you, sir--you, Morris--you,
knight of the sorrowful countenance--is this Mr. Francis Osbaldistone the
gentleman whom you charge with being art and part of felony?â€

â€œI, sir?â€ replied Morris, whose scattered wits had hardly yet reassembled
themselves; â€œI charge nothing--I say nothing against the gentleman,â€

â€œThen we dismiss your complaint, sir, thatâ€™s all, and a good riddance--
Push about the bottle--Mr. Osbaldistone, help yourself.â€

Jobson, however, was determined that Morris should not back out of the
scrape so easily. â€œWhat do you mean, Mr. Morris?--Here is your own
declaration--the ink scarce dried--and you would retract it in this
scandalous manner!â€

â€œHow do I know,â€ whispered the other in a tremulous tone, â€œhow many
rogues are in the house to back him? I have read of such things in
Johnsonâ€™s Lives of the Highwaymen. I protest the door opensâ€--

And it did open, and Diana Vernon entered--â€œYou keep fine order here,
Justice--not a servant to be seen or heard of.â€

â€œAh!â€ said the Justice, starting up with an alacrity which showed that he
was not so engrossed by his devotions to Themis or Comus, as to forget
what was due to beauty--â€œAh, ha! Die Vernon, the heath-bell of Cheviot,
and the blossom of the Border, come to see how the old bachelor keeps
house? Art welcome, girl, as flowers in May.â€

â€œA fine, open, hospitable house you do keep, Justice, that must be
allowed--not a soul to answer a visitor.â€

â€œAh, the knaves! they reckoned themselves secure of me for a couple of
hours--But why did you not come earlier?--Your cousin Rashleigh dined
here, and ran away like a poltroon after the first bottle was out--But
you have not dined--weâ€™ll have something nice and ladylike--sweet and
pretty like yourself, tossed up in a trice.â€

â€œI may eat a crust in the ante-room before I set out,â€ answered Miss
Vernon--â€œI have had a long ride this morning; but I canâ€™t stay long,
Justice--I came with my cousin, Frank Osbaldistone, there, and I must
show him the way back again to the Hall, or heâ€™ll lose himself in the
wolds.â€

â€œWhew! sits the wind in that quarter?â€ inquired the Justice--

           â€œShe showed him the way, she showed him the way,
                     She showed him the way to woo.

What! no luck for old fellows, then, my sweet bud of the wilderness?â€

â€œNone whatever, Squire Inglewood; but if you will be a good kind Justice,
and despatch young Frankâ€™s business, and let us canter home again, Iâ€™ll
bring my uncle to dine with you next week, and weâ€™ll expect merry
doings.â€

â€œAnd you shall find them, my pearl of the Tyne--Zookers, lass, I never
envy these young fellows their rides and scampers, unless when you come
across me. But I must not keep you just now, I suppose?--I am quite
satisfied with Mr. Francis Osbaldistoneâ€™s explanation--here has been some
mistake, which can be cleared at greater leisure.â€

â€œPardon me, sir,â€ said I; â€œbut I have not heard the nature of the
accusation yet.â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ said the clerk, who, at the appearance of Miss Vernon, had
given up the matter in despair, but who picked up courage to press
farther investigation on finding himself supported from a quarter whence
assuredly he expected no backing--â€œYes, sir, and Dalton saith, That he
who is apprehended as a felon shall not be discharged upon any manâ€™s
discretion, but shall be held either to bail or commitment, paying to the
clerk of the peace the usual fees for recognisance or commitment.â€

The Justice, thus goaded on, gave me at length a few words of
explanation.

It seems the tricks which I had played to this man Morris had made a
strong impression on his imagination; for I found they had been arrayed
against me in his evidence, with all the exaggerations which a timorous
and heated imagination could suggest. It appeared also, that on the day
he parted from me, he had been stopped on a solitary spot and eased of
his beloved travelling-companion, the portmanteau, by two men, well
mounted and armed, having their faces covered with vizards.

One of them, he conceived, had much of my shape and air, and in a
whispering conversation which took place betwixt the freebooters, he
heard the other apply to him the name of Osbaldistone. The declaration
farther set forth, that upon inquiring into the principles of the family
so named, he, the said declarant, was informed that they were of the
worst description, the family, in all its members, having been Papists
and Jacobites, as he was given to understand by the dissenting clergyman
at whose house he stopped after his rencontre, since the days of William
the Conqueror.

Upon all and each of these weighty reasons, he charged me with being
accessory to the felony committed upon his person; he, the said
declarant, then travelling in the special employment of Government, and
having charge of certain important papers, and also a large sum in
specie, to be paid over, according to his instructions, to certain
persons of official trust and importance in Scotland.

Having heard this extraordinary accusation, I replied to it, that the
circumstances on which it was founded were such as could warrant no
justice, or magistrate, in any attempt on my personal liberty. I admitted
that I had practised a little upon the terrors of Mr. Morris, while we
travelled together, but in such trifling particulars as could have
excited apprehension in no one who was one whit less timorous and jealous
than himself. But I added, that I had never seen him since we parted, and
if that which he feared had really come upon him, I was in nowise
accessory to an action so unworthy of my character and station in life.
That one of the robbers was called Osbaldistone, or that such a name was
mentioned in the course of the conversation betwixt them, was a trifling
circumstance, to which no weight was due. And concerning the disaffection
alleged against me, I was willing to prove, to the satisfaction of the
Justice, the clerk, and even the witness himself, that I was of the same
persuasion as his friend the dissenting clergyman; had been educated as a
good subject in the principles of the Revolution, and as such now
demanded the personal protection of the laws which had been assured by
that great event.

The Justice fidgeted, took snuff, and seemed considerably embarrassed,
while Mr. Attorney Jobson, with all the volubility of his profession, ran
over the statute of the 34 Edward III., by which justices of the peace
are allowed to arrest all those whom they find by indictment or
suspicion, and to put them into prison. The rogue even turned my own
admissions against me, alleging, â€œthat since I had confessedly, upon my
own showing, assumed the bearing or deportment of a robber or malefactor,
I had voluntarily subjected myself to the suspicions of which I
complained, and brought myself within the compass of the act, having
wilfully clothed my conduct with all the colour and livery of guilt.â€

I combated both his arguments and his jargon with much indignation and
scorn, and observed, â€œThat I should, if necessary, produce the bail of my
relations, which I conceived could not be refused, without subjecting the
magistrate in a misdemeanour.â€

â€œPardon me, my good sir--pardon me,â€ said the insatiable clerk; â€œthis is
a case in which neither bail nor mainprize can be received, the felon who
is liable to be committed on heavy grounds of suspicion, not being
replevisable under the statute of the 3d of King Edward, there being in
that act an express exception of such as be charged of commandment, or
force, and aid of felony done;â€ and he hinted that his worship would do
well to remember that such were no way replevisable by common writ, nor
without writ.

At this period of the conversation a servant entered, and delivered a
letter to Mr. Jobson. He had no sooner run it hastily over, than he
exclaimed, with the air of one who wished to appear much vexed at the
interruption, and felt the consequence attached to a man of multifarious
avocations--â€œGood God!--why, at this rate, I shall have neither time to
attend to the public concerns nor my own--no rest--no quiet--I wish to
Heaven another gentleman in our line would settle here!â€

â€œGod forbid!â€ said the Justice in a tone of _sotto-voce_ deprecation;
â€œsome of us have enough of one of the tribe.â€

â€œThis is a matter of life and death, if your worship pleases.â€

â€œIn Godâ€™s name! no more justice business, I hope,â€ said the alarmed
magistrate.

â€œNo--no,â€ replied Mr. Jobson, very consequentially; â€œold Gaffer Rutledge
of Grimeâ€™s-hill is subpoenaed for the next world; he has sent an express
for Dr. Kill-down to put in bail--another for me to arrange his worldly
affairs.â€

â€œAway with you, then,â€ said Mr. Inglewood, hastily; â€œhis may not be a
replevisable case under the statute, you know, or Mr. Justice Death may
not like the doctor for a _main pernor,_ or bailsman.â€

â€œAnd yet,â€ said Jobson, lingering as he moved towards the door, â€œif my
presence here be necessary--I could make out the warrant for committal in
a moment, and the constable is below--And you have heard,â€ he said,
lowering his voice, â€œMr. Rashleighâ€™s opinionâ€--the rest was lost in a
whisper.

The Justice replied aloud, â€œI tell thee no, man, no--weâ€™ll do nought till
thou return, man; â€˜tis but a four-mile ride--Come, push the bottle, Mr.
Morris--Donâ€™t be cast down, Mr. Osbaldistone--And you, my rose of the
wilderness--one cup of claret to refresh the bloom of your cheeks.â€

Diana started, as if from a reverie, in which she appeared to have been
plunged while we held this discussion. â€œNo, Justice--I should be afraid
of transferring the bloom to a part of my face where it would show to
little advantage; but I will pledge you in a cooler beverage;â€ and
filling a glass with water, she drank it hastily, while her hurried
manner belied her assumed gaiety.

I had not much leisure to make remarks upon her demeanour, however, being
full of vexation at the interference of fresh obstacles to an instant
examination of the disgraceful and impertinent charge which was brought
against me. But there was no moving the Justice to take the matter up in
absence of his clerk, an incident which gave him apparently as much
pleasure as a holiday to a schoolboy. He persisted in his endeavours to
inspire jollity into a company, the individuals of which, whether
considered with reference to each other, or to their respective
situations, were by no means inclined to mirth. â€œCome, Master Morris,
youâ€™re not the first man thatâ€™s been robbed, I trow--grieving neâ€™er
brought back loss, man. And you, Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, are not the
first bully-boy that has said stand to a true man. There was Jack
Winterfield, in my young days, kept the best company in the land--at
horse-races and cock-fights who but he--hand and glove was I with Jack.
Push the bottle, Mr. Morris, itâ€™s dry talking--Many quart bumpers have I
cracked, and thrown many a merry main with poor Jack--good family--ready
wit--quick eye--as honest a fellow, barring the deed he died for--weâ€™ll
drink to his memory, gentlemen--Poor Jack Winterfield--And since we talk
of him, and of those sort of things, and since that d--d clerk of mine
has taken his gibberish elsewhere, and since weâ€™re snug among ourselves,
Mr. Osbaldistone, if you will have my best advice, I would take up this
matter--the lawâ€™s hard--very severe--hanged poor Jack Winterfield at
York, despite family connections and great interest, all for easing a fat
west-country grazier of the price of a few beasts--Now, here is honest
Mr. Morris, has been frightened, and so forth--D--n it, man, let the poor
fellow have back his portmanteau, and end the frolic at once.â€

Morrisâ€™s eyes brightened up at this suggestion, and he began to hesitate
forth an assurance that he thirsted for no manâ€™s blood, when I cut the
proposed accommodation short, by resenting the Justiceâ€™s suggestion as an
insult, that went directly to suppose me guilty of the very crime which I
had come to his house with the express intention of disavowing. We were
in this awkward predicament when a servant, opening the door, announced,
â€œA strange gentleman to wait upon his honour;â€ and the party whom he thus
described entered the room without farther ceremony.


CHAPTER NINTH.

             One of the thieves come back again! Iâ€™ll stand close,
             He dares not wrong me now, so near the house,
             And call in vain â€˜tis, till I see him offer it.
                                          The Widow.

â€œA stranger!â€ echoed the Justice--â€œnot upon business, I trust, for Iâ€™ll
beâ€--

His protestation was cut short by the answer of the man himself. â€œMy
business is of a nature somewhat onerous and particular,â€ said my
acquaintance, Mr. Campbell--for it was he, the very Scotchman whom I had
seen at Northallerton--â€œand I must solicit your honour to give instant
and heedful consideration to it.--I believe, Mr. Morris,â€ he added,
fixing his eye on that person with a look of peculiar firmness and almost
ferocity--â€œI believe ye ken brawly what I am--I believe ye cannot have
forgotten what passed at our last meeting on the road?â€ Morrisâ€™s jaw
dropped--his countenance became the colour of tallow--his teeth
chattered, and he gave visible signs of the utmost consternation. â€œTake
heart of grace, man,â€ said Campbell, â€œand dinna sit clattering your jaws
there like a pair of castanets! I think there can be nae difficulty in
your telling Mr. Justice, that ye have seen me of yore, and ken me to be
a cavalier of fortune, and a man of honour. Ye ken fuâ€™ weel ye will be
some time resident in my vicinity, when I may have the power, as I will
possess the inclination, to do you as good a turn.â€

â€œSir--sir--I believe you to be a man of honour, and, as you say, a man of
fortune. Yes, Mr. Inglewood,â€ he added, clearing his voice, â€œI really
believe this gentleman to be so.â€

â€œAnd what are this gentlemanâ€™s commands with me?â€ said the Justice,
somewhat peevishly. â€œOne man introduces another, like the rhymes in the
â€˜house that Jack built,â€™ and I get company without either peace or
conversation!â€

â€œBoth shall be yours, sir,â€ answered Campbell, â€œin a brief period of
time. I come to release your mind from a piece of troublesome duty, not
to make increment to it.â€

â€œBody oâ€™ me! then you are welcome as ever Scot was to England, and thatâ€™s
not saying much. But get on, man--letâ€™s hear what you have got to say at
once.â€

â€œI presume, this gentleman,â€ continued the North Briton, â€œtold you there
was a person of the name of Campbell with him, when he had the mischance
to lose his valise?â€

â€œHe has not mentioned such a name, from beginning to end of the matter,â€
 said the Justice.

â€œAh! I conceive--I conceive,â€ replied Mr. Campbell;--â€œMr. Morris was
kindly afeared of committing a stranger into collision wiâ€™ the judicial
forms of the country; but as I understand my evidence is necessary to the
compurgation of one honest gentleman here, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone, wha
has been most unjustly suspected, I will dispense with the precaution. Ye
will thereforeâ€ (he added addressing Morris with the same determined look
and accent) â€œplease tell Mr. Justice Inglewood, whether we did not travel
several miles together on the road, in consequence of your own anxious
request and suggestion, reiterated ance and again, baith on the evening
that we were at Northallerton, and there declined by me, but afterwards
accepted, when I overtook ye on the road near Cloberry Allers, and was
prevailed on by you to resign my ain intentions of proceeding to
Rothbury; and, for my misfortune, to accompany you on your proposed
route.â€

â€œItâ€™s a melancholy truth,â€ answered Morris, holding down his head, as he
gave this general assent to the long and leading question which Campbell
put to him, and seemed to acquiesce in the statement it contained with
rueful docility.

â€œAnd I presume you can also asseverate to his worship, that no man is
better qualified than I am to bear testimony in this case, seeing that I
was by you, and near you, constantly during the whole occurrence.â€

â€œNo man better qualified, certainly,â€ said Morris, with a deep and
embarrassed sigh.

â€œAnd why the devil did you not assist him, then,â€ said the Justice,
â€œsince, by Mr. Morrisâ€™s account, there were but two robbers; so you were
two to two, and you are both stout likely men?â€

â€œSir, if it please your worship,â€ said Campbell, â€œI have been all my life
a man of peace and quietness, noways given to broils or batteries. Mr.
Morris, who belongs, as I understand, or hath belonged, to his Majestyâ€™s
army, might have used his pleasure in resistance, he travelling, as I
also understand, with a great charge of treasure; but, for me, who had
but my own small peculiar to defend, and who am, moreover, a man of a
pacific occupation, I was unwilling to commit myself to hazard in the
matter.â€

I looked at Campbell as he muttered these words, and never recollect to
have seen a more singular contrast than that between the strong daring
sternness expressed in his harsh features, and the air of composed
meekness and simplicity which his language assumed. There was even a
slight ironical smile lurking about the corners of his mouth, which
seemed, involuntarily as it were, to intimate his disdain of the quiet
and peaceful character which he thought proper to assume, and which led
me to entertain strange suspicions that his concern in the violence done
to Morris had been something very different from that of a
fellow-sufferer, or even of a mere spectator.

Perhaps some suspicious crossed the Justiceâ€™s mind at the moment, for he
exclaimed, as if by way of ejaculation, â€œBody oâ€™ me! but this is a
strange story.â€

The North Briton seemed to guess at what was passing in his mind; for he
went on, with a change of manner and tone, dismissing from his
countenance some part of the hypocritical affectation of humility which
had made him obnoxious to suspicion, and saying, with a more frank and
unconstrained air, â€œTo say the truth, I am just ane oâ€™ those canny folks
wha care not to fight but when they hae gotten something to fight for,
which did not chance to be my predicament when I fell in wiâ€™ these loons.
But that your worship may know that I am a person of good fame and
character, please to cast your eye over that billet.â€

Mr. Inglewood took the paper from his hand, and read, half aloud, â€œThese
are to certify, that the bearer, Robert Campbell of--of some place which
I cannot pronounce,â€ interjected the Justice--â€œis a person of good
lineage, and peaceable demeanour, travelling towards England on his own
proper affairs, &c. &c. &c. Given under our hand, at our Castle of
Inver--Invera--rara--Argyle.â€

â€œA slight testimonial, sir, which I thought fit to impetrate from that
worthy noblemanâ€ (here he raised his hand to his head, as if to touch his
hat), â€œMacCallum More.â€

â€œMacCallum who, sir?â€ said the Justice.

â€œWhom the Southern call the Duke of Argyle.â€

â€œI know the Duke of Argyle very well to be a nobleman of great worth and
distinction, and a true lover of his country. I was one of those that
stood by him in 1714, when he unhorsed the Duke of Marlborough out of his
command. I wish we had more noblemen like him. He was an honest Tory in
those days, and hand and glove with Ormond. And he has acceded to the
present Government, as I have done myself, for the peace and quiet of his
country; for I cannot presume that great man to have been actuated, as
violent folks pretend, with the fear of losing his places and regiment.
His testimonial, as you call it, Mr. Campbell, is perfectly satisfactory;
and now, what have you got to say to this matter of the robbery?â€

â€œBriefly this, if it please your worship,--that Mr. Morris might as weel
charge it against the babe yet to be born, or against myself even, as
against this young gentleman, Mr. Osbaldistone; for I am not only free to
depone that the person whom he took for him was a shorter man, and a
thicker man, but also, for I chanced to obtain a glisk of his visage, as
his fause-face slipped aside, that he was a man of other features and
complexion than those of this young gentleman, Mr. Osbaldistone. And I
believe,â€ he added, turning round with a natural, yet somewhat sterner
air, to Mr. Morris, â€œthat the gentleman will allow I had better
opportunity to take cognisance wha were present on that occasion than he,
being, I believe, much the cooler oâ€™ the twa.â€

â€œI agree to it, sir--I agree to it perfectly,â€ said Morris, shrinking
back as Campbell moved his chair towards him to fortify his appeal--â€œAnd
I incline, sir,â€ he added, addressing Mr. Inglewood, â€œto retract my
information as to Mr. Osbaldistone; and I request, sir, you will permit
him, sir, to go about his business, and me to go about mine also; your
worship may have business to settle with Mr. Campbell, and I am rather in
haste to be gone.â€

â€œThen, there go the declarations,â€ said the Justice, throwing them into
the fire--â€œAnd now you are at perfect liberty, Mr Osbaldistone. And you,
Mr. Morris, are set quite at your ease.â€

â€œAy,â€ said Campbell, eyeing Morris as he assented with a rueful grin to
the Justiceâ€™s observations, â€œmuch like the ease of a tod under a pair of
harrows--But fear nothing, Mr. Morris; you and I maun leave the house
thegither. I will see you safe--I hope you will not doubt my honour, when
I say sae--to the next highway, and then we part company; and if we do
not meet as friends in Scotland, it will be your ain fault.â€

With such a lingering look of terror as the condemned criminal throws,
when he is informed that the cart awaits him, Morris arose; but when on
his legs, appeared to hesitate. â€œI tell thee, man, fear nothing,â€
 reiterated Campbell; â€œI will keep my word with you--Why, thou sheepâ€™s
heart, how do ye ken but we may can pick up some speerings of your
valise, if ye will be amenable to gude counsel?--Our horses are ready.
Bid the Justice fareweel, man, and show your Southern breeding.â€

Morris, thus exhorted and encouraged, took his leave, under the escort of
Mr. Campbell; but, apparently, new scruples and terrors had struck him
before they left the house, for I heard Campbell reiterating assurances
of safety and protection as they left the ante-room--â€œBy the soul of my
body, man, thouâ€™rt as safe as in thy fatherâ€™s kailyard--Zounds! that a
chield wiâ€™ sic a black beard should hae nae mair heart than a
hen-partridge!--Come on wiâ€™ ye, like a frank fallow, anes and for aye.â€

The voices died away, and the subsequent trampling of their horses
announced to us that they had left the mansion of Justice Inglewood.

The joy which that worthy magistrate received at this easy conclusion of
a matter which threatened him with some trouble in his judicial capacity,
was somewhat damped by reflection on what his clerkâ€™s views of the
transaction might be at his return. â€œNow, I shall have Jobson on my
shoulders about these d--d papers--I doubt I should not have destroyed
them, after all--But hang it! it is only paying his fees, and that will
make all smooth--And now, Miss Die Vernon, though I have liberated all
the others, I intend to sign a writ for committing you to the custody of
Mother Blakes, my old housekeeper, for the evening, and we will send for
my neighbour Mrs. Musgrave, and the Miss Dawkins, and your cousins, and
have old Cobs the fiddler, and be as merry as the maids; and Frank
Osbaldistone and I will have a carouse that will make us fit company for
you in half-an-hour.â€

â€œThanks, most worshipful,â€ returned Miss Vernon; â€œbut, as matters stand,
we must return instantly to Osbaldistone Hall, where they do not know
what has become of us, and relieve my uncle of his anxiety on my cousinâ€™s
account, which is just the same as if one of his own sons were
concerned.â€

â€œI believe it truly,â€ said the Justice; â€œfor when his eldest son, Archie,
came to a bad end, in that unlucky affair of Sir John Fenwickâ€™s, old
Hildebrand used to hollo out his name as readily as any of the remaining
six, and then complain that he could not recollect which of his sons had
been hanged. So, pray hasten home, and relieve his paternal solicitude,
since go you must. But hark thee hither, heath-blossom,â€ he said, pulling
her towards him by the hand, and in a good-humoured tone of admonition,
â€œanother time let the law take its course, without putting your pretty
finger into her old musty pie, all full of fragments of law
gibberish--French and dog-Latin--And, Die, my beauty, let young fellows
show each other the way through the moors, in case you should lose your
own road, while you are pointing out theirs, my pretty Will oâ€™ the
Wisp.â€

With this admonition, he saluted and dismissed Miss Vernon, and took an
equally kind farewell of me.

â€œThou seems to be a good tight lad, Mr. Frank, and I remember thy father
too--he was my playfellow at school. Hark thee, lad,--ride early at
night, and donâ€™t swagger with chance passengers on the kingâ€™s highway.
What, man! all the kingâ€™s liege subjects are not bound to understand
joking, and itâ€™s ill cracking jests on matters of felony. And hereâ€™s poor
Die Vernon too--in a manner alone and deserted on the face of this wide
earth, and left to ride, and run, and scamper, at her own silly pleasure.
Thou must be careful of Die, or, egad, I will turn a young fellow again
on purpose, and fight thee myself, although I must own it would be a
great deal of trouble. And now, get ye both gone, and leave me to my pipe
of tobacco, and my meditations; for what says the song--

                  The Indian leaf doth briefly burn;
                  So doth manâ€™s strength to weakness turn
                  The fire of youth extinguished quite,
                  Comes age, like embers, dry and white.
                  Think of this as you take tobacco.â€ 

I was much pleased with the gleams of sense and feeling which escaped
from the Justice through the vapours of sloth and self-indulgence,
assured him of my respect to his admonitions, and took a friendly
farewell of the honest magistrate and his hospitable mansion.

We found a repast prepared for us in the ante-room, which we partook of
slightly, and rejoined the same servant of Sir Hildebrand who had taken
our horses at our entrance, and who had been directed, as he informed
Miss Vernon, by Mr. Rashleigh, to wait and attend upon us home. We rode a
little way in silence, for, to say truth, my mind was too much bewildered
with the events of the morning, to permit me to be the first to break it.
At length Miss Vernon exclaimed, as if giving vent to her own
reflections, â€œWell, Rashleigh is a man to be feared and wondered at, and
all but loved; he does whatever he pleases, and makes all others his
puppets--has a player ready to perform every part which he imagines, and
an invention and readiness which supply expedients for every emergency.â€

â€œYou think, then,â€ said I, answering rather to her meaning, than to the
express words she made use of, â€œthat this Mr. Campbell, whose appearance
was so opportune, and who trussed up and carried off my accuser as a
falcon trusses a partridge, was an agent of Mr. Rashleigh
Osbaldistoneâ€™s?â€

â€œI do guess as much,â€ replied Diana; â€œand shrewdly suspect, moreover,
that he would hardly have appeared so very much in the nick of time, if I
had not happened to meet Rashleigh in the hall at the Justiceâ€™s.â€

â€œIn that case, my thanks are chiefly due to you, my fair preserver.â€

â€œTo be sure they are,â€ returned Diana; â€œand pray, suppose them paid, and
accepted with a gracious smile, for I do not care to be troubled with
hearing them in good earnest, and am much more likely to yawn than to
behave becoming. In short, Mr. Frank, I wished to serve you, and I have
fortunately been able to do so, and have only one favour to ask in
return, and that is, that you will say no more about it.--But who comes
here to meet us, â€˜bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste?â€™ It is the
subordinate man of law, I think--no less than Mr. Joseph Jobson.â€

And Mr. Joseph Jobson it proved to be, in great haste, and, as it
speedily appeared, in most extreme bad humour. He came up to us, and
stopped his horse, as we were about to pass with a slight salutation.

â€œSo, sir--so, Miss Vernon--ay, I see well enough how it is--bail put in
during my absence, I suppose--I should like to know who drew the
recognisance, thatâ€™s all. If his worship uses this form of procedure
often, I advise him to get another clerk, thatâ€™s all, for I shall
certainly demit.â€

â€œOr suppose he get this present clerk stitched to his sleeve, Mr.
Jobson,â€ said Diana; â€œwould not that do as well? And pray, how does
Farmer Rutledge, Mr. Jobson? I hope you found him able to sign, seal, and
deliver?â€

This question seemed greatly to increase the wrath of the man of law. He
looked at Miss Vernon with such an air of spite and resentment, as laid
me under a strong temptation to knock him off his horse with the butt-end
of my whip, which I only suppressed in consideration of his
insignificance.

â€œFarmer Rutledge, maâ€™am?â€ said the clerk, as soon as his indignation
permitted him to articulate, â€œFarmer Rutledge is in as handsome enjoyment
of his health as you are--itâ€™s all a bam, maâ€™am--all a bamboozle and a
bite, that affair of his illness; and if you did not know as much before,
you know it now, maâ€™am.â€

â€œLa you there now!â€ replied Miss Vernon, with an affectation of extreme
and simple wonder, â€œsure you donâ€™t say so, Mr. Jobson?â€

â€œBut I _do_ say so, maâ€™am,â€ rejoined the incensed scribe; â€œand
moreover I say, that the old miserly clod-breaker called me
pettifogger--pettifogger, maâ€™am--and said I came to hunt for a job,
maâ€™am--which I have no more right to have said to me than any other
gentleman of my profession, maâ€™am--especially as I am clerk to the
peace, having and holding said office under _Trigesimo Septimo Henrici
Octavi_ and _Primo Gulielmi,_ the first of King William, maâ€™am, of
glorious and immortal memory--our immortal deliverer from papists and
pretenders, and wooden shoes and warming pans, Miss Vernon.â€

â€œSad things, these wooden shoes and warming pans,â€ retorted the young
lady, who seemed to take pleasure in augmenting his wrath;--â€œand it is a
comfort you donâ€™t seem to want a warming pan at present, Mr. Jobson. I am
afraid Gaffer Rutledge has not confined his incivility to language--Are
you sure he did not give you a beating?â€

â€œBeating, maâ€™am!--noâ€--(very shortly)--â€œno man alive shall beat me, I
promise you, maâ€™am.â€

â€œThat is according as you happen to merit, sir,â€ said I: â€œfor your mode
of speaking to this young lady is so unbecoming, that, if you do not
change your tone, I shall think it worth while to chastise you myself.â€

â€œChastise, sir? and--me, sir?--Do you know whom you speak to, sir?â€

â€œYes, sir,â€ I replied; â€œyou say yourself you are clerk of peace to the
county; and Gaffer Rutledge says you are a pettifogger; and in neither
capacity are you entitled to be impertinent to a young lady of fashion.â€

Miss Vernon laid her hand on my arm, and exclaimed, â€œCome, Mr.
Osbaldistone, I will have no assaults and battery on Mr. Jobson; I am
not in sufficient charity with him to permit a single touch of your
whip--why, he would live on it for a term at least. Besides, you have
already hurt his feelings sufficiently--you have called him
impertinent.â€

â€œI donâ€™t value his language, Miss,â€ said the clerk, somewhat crestfallen:
â€œbesides, impertinent is not an actionable word; but pettifogger is
slander in the highest degree, and that I will make Gaffer Rutledge know
to his cost, and all who maliciously repeat the same, to the breach of
the public peace, and the taking away of my private good name.â€

â€œNever mind that, Mr. Jobson,â€ said Miss Vernon; â€œyou know, where there
is nothing, your own law allows that the king himself must lose his
rights; and for the taking away of your good name, I pity the poor fellow
who gets it, and wish you joy of losing it with all my heart.â€

â€œVery well, maâ€™am--good evening, maâ€™am--I have no more to say--only there
are laws against papists, which it would be well for the land were they
better executed. Thereâ€™s third and fourth Edward VI., of antiphoners,
missals, grailes, professionals, manuals, legends, pies, portuasses, and
those that have such trinkets in their possession, Miss Vernon--and
thereâ€™s summoning of papists to take the oaths--and there are popish
recusant convicts under the first of his present Majesty--ay, and there
are penalties for hearing mass--See twenty-third of Queen Elizabeth, and
third James First, chapter twenty-fifth. And there are estates to be
registered, and deeds and wills to be enrolled, and double taxes to be
made, according to the acts in that case made and providedâ€--

â€œSee the new edition of the Statutes at Large, published under the
careful revision of Joseph Jobson, Gent., Clerk of the Peace,â€ said Miss
Vernon.

â€œAlso, and above all,â€ continued Jobson,--â€œfor I speak to your
warning--you, Diana Vernon, spinstress, not being a _femme couverte,_
and being a convict popish recusant, are bound to repair to your own
dwelling, and that by the nearest way, under penalty of being held felon
to the king--and diligently to seek for passage at common ferries, and
to tarry there but one ebb and flood; and unless you can have it in such
places, to walk every day into the water up to the knees, assaying to
pass over.â€

â€œA sort of Protestant penance for my Catholic errors, I suppose,â€ said
Miss Vernon, laughing.--â€œWell, I thank you for the information, Mr.
Jobson, and will hie me home as fast as I can, and be a better
housekeeper in time coming. Good-night, my dear Mr. Jobson, thou mirror
of clerical courtesy.â€

â€œGood-night, maâ€™am, and remember the law is not to be trifled with.â€

And we rode on our separate ways.

â€œThere he goes for a troublesome mischief-making tool,â€ said Miss Vernon,
as she gave a glance after him; â€œit is hard that persons of birth and rank
and estate should be subjected to the official impertinence of such a
paltry pickthank as that, merely for believing as the whole world
believed not much above a hundred years ago--for certainly our Catholic
Faith has the advantage of antiquity at least.â€

â€œI was much tempted to have broken the rascalâ€™s head,â€ I replied.

â€œYou would have acted very like a hasty young man,â€ said Miss Vernon;
â€œand yet, had my own hand been an ounce heavier than it is, I think I
should have laid its weight upon him. Well, it does not signify
complaining, but there are three things for which I am much to be pitied,
if any one thought it worth while to waste any compassion upon me.â€

â€œAnd what are these three things, Miss Vernon, may I ask?â€

â€œWill you promise me your deepest sympathy, if I tell you?â€

â€œCertainly;--can you doubt it?â€ I replied, closing my horse nearer to
hers as I spoke, with an expression of interest which I did not attempt
to disguise.

â€œWell, it is very seducing to be pitied, after all; so here are my three
grievances: In the first place, I am a girl, and not a young fellow, and
would be shut up in a mad-house if I did half the things that I have a
mind to;--and that, if I had your happy prerogative of acting as you
list, would make all the world mad with imitating and applauding me.â€

â€œI canâ€™t quite afford you the sympathy you expect upon this score,â€ I
replied; â€œthe misfortune is so general, that it belongs to one half of
the species; and the other halfâ€--

â€œAre so much better cared for, that they are jealous of their
prerogatives,â€ interrupted Miss Vernon--â€œI forgot you were a party
interested. Nay,â€ she said, as I was going to speak, â€œthat soft smile is
intended to be the preface of a very pretty compliment respecting the
peculiar advantages which Die Vernonâ€™s friends and kinsmen enjoy, by her
being born one of their Helots; but spare me the utterance, my good
friend, and let us try whether we shall agree better on the second count
of my indictment against fortune, as that quill-driving puppy would call
it. I belong to an oppressed sect and antiquated religion, and, instead
of getting credit for my devotion, as is due to all good girls beside, my
kind friend, Justice Inglewood, may send me to the house of correction,
merely for worshipping God in the way of my ancestors, and say, as old
Pembroke did to the Abbess of Wilton, when he usurped her convent and
establishment, â€˜Go spin, you jade,--Go spin.â€™â€

â€œThis is not a cureless evil,â€ said I gravely. â€œConsult some of our
learned divines, or consult your own excellent understanding, Miss
Vernon; and surely the particulars in which our religious creed differs
from that in which you have been educatedâ€--

â€œHush!â€ said Diana, placing her fore-finger on her mouth,--â€œHush! no more
of that. Forsake the faith of my gallant fathers! I would as soon, were I
a man, forsake their banner when the tide of battle pressed hardest
against it, and turn, like a hireling recreant, to join the victorious
enemy.â€

â€œI honour your spirit, Miss Vernon; and as to the inconveniences to which
it exposes you, I can only say, that wounds sustained for the sake of
conscience carry their own balsam with the blow.â€

â€œAy; but they are fretful and irritating, for all that. But I see, hard
of heart as you are, my chance of beating hemp, or drawing out flax into
marvellous coarse thread, affects you as little as my condemnation to
coif and pinners, instead of beaver and cockade; so I will spare myself
the fruitless pains of telling my third cause of vexation.â€

â€œNay, my dear Miss Vernon, do not withdraw your confidence, and I will
promise you, that the threefold sympathy due to your very unusual causes
of distress shall be all duly and truly paid to account of the third,
providing you assure me, that it is one which you neither share with all
womankind, nor even with every Catholic in England, who, God bless you,
are still a sect more numerous than we Protestants, in our zeal for
church and state, would desire them to be.â€

â€œIt is indeed,â€ said Diana, with a manner greatly altered, and more
serious than I had yet seen her assume, â€œa misfortune that well merits
compassion. I am by nature, as you may easily observe, of a frank and
unreserved disposition--a plain true-hearted girl, who would willingly
act openly and honestly by the whole world, and yet fate has involved me
in such a series of nets and toils, and entanglements, that I dare hardly
speak a word for fear of consequences--not to myself, but to others.â€

â€œThat is indeed a misfortune, Miss Vernon, which I do most sincerely
compassionate, but which I should hardly have anticipated.â€

â€œO, Mr. Osbaldistone, if you but knew--if any one knew, what difficulty I
sometimes find in hiding an aching heart with a smooth brow, you would
indeed pity me. I do wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you even thus far on
my own situation; but you are a young man of sense and penetration--you
cannot but long to ask me a hundred questions on the events of this
day--on the share which Rashleigh has in your deliverance from this petty
scrape--upon many other points which cannot but excite your attention;
and I cannot bring myself to answer with the necessary falsehood and
finesse--I should do it awkwardly, and lose your good opinion, if I have
any share of it, as well as my own. It is best to say at once, Ask me no
questions,--I have it not in my power to reply to them.â€

Miss Vernon spoke these words with a tone of feeling which could not but
make a corresponding impression upon me. I assured her she had neither to
fear my urging her with impertinent questions, nor my misconstruing her
declining to answer those which might in themselves be reasonable, or at
least natural.

â€œI was too much obliged,â€ I said, â€œby the interest she had taken in my
affairs, to misuse the opportunity her goodness had afforded me of prying
into hers--I only trusted and entreated, that if my services could at any
time be useful, she would command them without doubt or hesitation.â€

â€œThank you--thank you,â€ she replied; â€œyour voice does not ring the cuckoo
chime of compliment, but speaks like that of one who knows to what he
pledges himself. If--but it is impossible--but yet, if an opportunity
should occur, I will ask you if you remember this promise; and I assure
you, I shall not be angry if I find you have forgotten it, for it is
enough that you are sincere in your intentions just now--much may occur
to alter them ere I call upon you, should that moment ever come, to
assist Die Vernon, as if you were Die Vernonâ€™s brother.â€

â€œAnd if I were Die Vernonâ€™s brother,â€ said I, â€œthere could not be less
chance that I should refuse my assistance--And now I am afraid I must not
ask whether Rashleigh was willingly accessory to my deliverance?â€

â€œNot of me; but you may ask it of himself, and depend upon it, he will
say _yes;_ for rather than any good action should walk through the world
like an unappropriated adjective in an ill-arranged sentence, he is
always willing to stand noun substantive to it himself.â€

â€œAnd I must not ask whether this Campbell be himself the party who eased
Mr. Morris of his portmanteau,--or whether the letter, which our friend
the attorney received, was not a finesse to withdraw him from the scene
of action, lest he should have marred the happy event of my deliverance?
And I must not askâ€--

â€œYou must ask nothing of me,â€ said Miss Vernon; â€œso it is quite in vain
to go on putting cases. You are to think just as well of me as if I had
answered all these queries, and twenty others besides, as glibly as
Rashleigh could have done; and observe, whenever I touch my chin just so,
it is a sign that I cannot speak upon the topic which happens to occupy
your attention. I must settle signals of correspondence with you, because
you are to be my confidant and my counsellor, only you are to know
nothing whatever of my affairs.â€

â€œNothing can be more reasonable,â€ I replied, laughing; â€œand the extent of
your confidence will, you may rely upon it, only be equalled by the
sagacity of my counsels.â€

This sort of conversation brought us, in the highest good-humour with
each other, to Osbaldistone Hall, where we found the family far advanced
in the revels of the evening.

â€œGet some dinner for Mr. Osbaldistone and me in the library,â€ said Miss
Vernon to a servant.--â€œI must have some compassion upon you,â€ she added,
turning to me, â€œand provide against your starving in this mansion of
brutal abundance; otherwise I am not sure that I should show you my
private haunts. This same library is my den--the only corner of the
Hall-house where I am safe from the Ourang-Outangs, my cousins. They
never venture there, I suppose for fear the folios should fall down and
crack their skulls; for they will never affect their heads in any other
way--So follow me.â€

And I followed through hall and bower, vaulted passage and winding stair,
until we reached the room where she had ordered our refreshments.





CHAPTER TENTH.


                In the wide pile, by others heeded not,
                    Hers was one sacred solitary spot,
                Whose gloomy aisles and bending shelves contain
                For moral hunger food, and cures for moral pain.
                                            Anonymous.

The library at Osbaldistone Hall was a gloomy room, whose antique oaken
shelves bent beneath the weight of the ponderous folios so dear to the
seventeenth century, from which, under favour be it spoken, we have
distilled matter for our quartos and octavos, and which, once more
subjected to the alembic, may, should our sons be yet more frivolous than
ourselves, be still farther reduced into duodecimos and pamphlets. The
collection was chiefly of the classics, as well foreign as ancient
history, and, above all, divinity. It was in wretched order. The priests,
who in succession had acted as chaplains at the Hall, were, for many
years, the only persons who entered its precincts, until Rashleighâ€™s
thirst for reading had led him to disturb the venerable spiders, who had
muffled the fronts of the presses with their tapestry. His destination
for the church rendered his conduct less absurd in his fatherâ€™s eyes,
than if any of his other descendants had betrayed so strange a
propensity, and Sir Hildebrand acquiesced in the library receiving some
repairs, so as to fit it for a sitting-room. Still an air of
dilapidation, as obvious as it was uncomfortable, pervaded the large
apartment, and announced the neglect from which the knowledge which its
walls contained had not been able to exempt it. The tattered tapestry,
the worm-eaten shelves, the huge and clumsy, yet tottering, tables,
desks, and chairs, the rusty grate, seldom gladdened by either sea-coal
or faggots, intimated the contempt of the lords of Osbaldistone Hall for
learning, and for the volumes which record its treasures.

â€œYou think this place somewhat disconsolate, I suppose?â€ said Diana, as I
glanced my eye round the forlorn apartment; â€œbut to me it seems like a
little paradise, for I call it my own, and fear no intrusion. Rashleigh
was joint proprietor with me, while we were friends.â€

â€œAnd are you no longer so?â€ was my natural question. Her fore-finger
immediately touched her dimpled chin, with an arch look of prohibition.

â€œWe are still _allies,_â€ she continued, â€œbound, like other confederate
powers, by circumstances of mutual interest; but I am afraid, as will
happen in other cases, the treaty of alliance has survived the amicable
dispositions in which it had its origin. At any rate, we live less
together; and when he comes through that door there, I vanish through
this door here; and so, having made the discovery that we two were one
too many for this apartment, as large as it seems, Rashleigh, whose
occasions frequently call him elsewhere, has generously made a cession of
his rights in my favour; so that I now endeavour to prosecute alone the
studies in which he used formerly to be my guide.â€

â€œAnd what are those studies, if I may presume to ask?â€

â€œIndeed you may, without the least fear of seeing my fore-finger raised
to my chin. Science and history are my principal favourites; but I also
study poetry and the classics.â€

â€œAnd the classics? Do you read them in the original?â€

â€œUnquestionably. Rashleigh, who is no contemptible scholar, taught me
Greek and Latin, as well as most of the languages of modern Europe. I
assure you there has been some pains taken in my education, although I
can neither sew a tucker, nor work cross-stitch, nor make a pudding,
nor--as the vicarâ€™s fat wife, with as much truth as elegance, good-will,
and politeness, was pleased to say in my behalf--do any other useful
thing in the varsal world.â€

â€œAnd was this selection of studies Rashleighâ€™s choice, or your own, Miss
Vernon?â€ I asked.

â€œUm!â€ said she, as if hesitating to answer my question,--â€œItâ€™s not worth
while lifting my finger about, after all. Why, partly his and partly
mine. As I learned out of doors to ride a horse, and bridle and saddle
him in cue of necessity, and to clear a five-barred gate, and fire a gun
without winking, and all other of those masculine accomplishments that my
brute cousins run mad after, I wanted, like my rational cousin, to read
Greek and Latin within doors, and make my complete approach to the tree
of knowledge, which you men-scholars would engross to yourselves, in
revenge, I suppose, for our common motherâ€™s share in the great original
transgression.â€

â€œAnd Rashleigh indulged your propensity to learning?â€

â€œWhy, he wished to have me for his scholar, and he could but teach me
that which he knew himself--he was not likely to instruct me in the
mysteries of washing lace-ruffles, or hemming cambric handkerchiefs, I
suppose.â€

â€œI admit the temptation of getting such a scholar, and have no doubt that
it made a weighty consideration on the tutorâ€™s part.â€

â€œOh, if you begin to investigate Rashleighâ€™s motives, my finger touches
my chin once more. I can only be frank where my own are inquired into.
But to resume--he has resigned the library in my favour, and never enters
without leave had and obtained; and so I have taken the liberty to make
it the place of deposit for some of my own goods and chattels, as you may
see by looking round you.â€

â€œI beg pardon, Miss Vernon, but I really see nothing around these walls
which I can distinguish as likely to claim you as mistress.â€

â€œThat is, I suppose, because you neither see a shepherd or shepherdess
wrought in worsted, and handsomely framed in black ebony, or a stuffed
parrot,--or a breeding-cage, full of canary birds,--or a housewife-case,
broidered with tarnished silver,--or a toilet-table with a nest of
japanned boxes, with as many angles as Christmas minced-pies,--or a
broken-backed spinet,--or a lute with three strings,--or rock-work,--or
shell-work,--or needle-work, or work of any kind,--or a lap-dog with a
litter of blind puppies--None of these treasures do I possess,â€ she
continued, after a pause, in order to recover the breath she had lost in
enumerating them--â€œBut there stands the sword of my ancestor Sir Richard
Vernon, slain at Shrewsbury, and sorely slandered by a sad fellow called
Will Shakspeare, whose Lancastrian partialities, and a certain knack at
embodying them, has turned history upside down, or rather inside
out;--and by that redoubted weapon hangs the mail of the still older
Vernon, squire to the Black Prince, whose fate is the reverse of his
descendantâ€™s, since he is more indebted to the bard who took the trouble
to celebrate him, for good-will than for talents,--

                 Amiddes the route you may discern one
          Brave knight, with pipes on shield, ycleped Vernon
                 Like a borne fiend along the plain he thundered,
          Prest to be carving throtes, while others plundered.

â€œThen there is a model of a new martingale, which I invented myself--a
great improvement on the Duke of Newcastleâ€™s; and there are the hood and
bells of my falcon Cheviot, who spitted himself on a heronâ€™s bill at
Horsely-moss--poor Cheviot, there is not a bird on the perches below, but
are kites and riflers compared to him; and there is my own light
fowling-piece, with an improved firelock; with twenty other treasures,
each more valuable than another--And there, that speaks for itself.â€

She pointed to the carved oak frame of a full-length portrait by Vandyke,
on which were inscribed, in Gothic letters, the words _Vernon semper
viret._ I looked at her for explanation. â€œDo you not know,â€ said she,
with some surprise, â€œour motto--the Vernon motto, where,

                    Like the solemn vice iniquity,
                    We moralise two meanings in one word

And do you not know our cognisance, the pipes?â€ pointing to the armorial
bearings sculptured on the oaken scutcheon, around which the legend was
displayed.

â€œPipes!--they look more like penny-whistles--But, pray, do not be angry
with my ignorance,â€ I continued, observing the colour mount to her
cheeks, â€œI can mean no affront to your armorial bearings, for I do not
even know my own.â€

â€œYou an Osbaldistone, and confess so much!â€ she exclaimed. â€œWhy, Percie,
Thornie, John, Dickon--Wilfred himself, might be your instructor. Even
ignorance itself is a plummet over you.â€

â€œWith shame I confess it, my dear Miss Vernon, the mysteries couched
under the grim hieroglyphics of heraldry are to me as unintelligible as
those of the pyramids of Egypt.â€

â€œWhat! is it possible?--Why, even my uncle reads Gwillym sometimes of a
winter night--Not know the figures of heraldry!--of what could your
father be thinking?â€

â€œOf the figures of arithmetic,â€ I answered; â€œthe most insignificant unit
of which he holds more highly than all the blazonry of chivalry. But,
though I am ignorant to this inexpressible degree, I have knowledge and
taste enough to admire that splendid picture, in which I think I can
discover a family likeness to you. What ease and dignity in the
attitude!--what richness of colouring--what breadth and depth of shade!â€

â€œIs it really a fine painting?â€ she asked.

â€œI have seen many works of the renowned artist,â€ I replied, â€œbut never
beheld one more to my liking!â€

â€œWell, I know as little of pictures as you do of heraldry,â€ replied Miss
Vernon; â€œyet I have the advantage of you, because I have always admired
the painting without understanding its value.â€

â€œWhile I have neglected pipes and tabors, and all the whimsical
combinations of chivalry, still I am informed that they floated in the
fields of ancient fame. But you will allow their exterior appearance is
not so peculiarly interesting to the uninformed spectator as that of a
fine painting.--Who is the person here represented?â€

â€œMy grandfather. He shared the misfortunes of Charles I., and, I am sorry
to add, the excesses of his son. Our patrimonial estate was greatly
impaired by his prodigality, and was altogether lost by his successor, my
unfortunate father. But peace be with them who have got it!--it was lost
in the cause of loyalty.â€

â€œYour father, I presume, suffered in the political dissensions of the
period?â€

â€œHe did indeed;--he lost his all. And hence is his child a dependent
orphan--eating the bread of others--subjected to their caprices, and
compelled to study their inclinations; yet prouder of having had such a
father, than if, playing a more prudent but less upright part, he had
left me possessor of all the rich and fair baronies which his family once
possessed.â€

As she thus spoke, the entrance of the servants with dinner cut off all
conversation but that of a general nature.

When our hasty meal was concluded, and the wine placed on the table, the
domestic informed us, â€œthat Mr. Rashleigh had desired to be told when our
dinner was removed.â€

â€œTell him,â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œwe shall be happy to see him if he will
step this way--place another wineglass and chair, and leave the room.--
You must retire with him when he goes away,â€ she continued, addressing
herself to me; â€œeven _my_ liberality cannot spare a gentleman above eight
hours out of the twenty-four; and I think we have been together for at
least that length of time.â€

â€œThe old scythe-man has moved so rapidly,â€ I answered, â€œthat I could not
count his strides.â€

â€œHush!â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œhere comes Rashleigh;â€ and she drew off her
chair, to which I had approached mine rather closely, so as to place a
greater distance between us. A modest tap at the door,--a gentle manner
of opening when invited to enter,--a studied softness and humility of
step and deportment, announced that the education of Rashleigh
Osbaldistone at the College of St. Omers accorded well with the ideas I
entertained of the manners of an accomplished Jesuit. I need not add,
that, as a sound Protestant, these ideas were not the most favourable.
â€œWhy should you use the ceremony of knocking,â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œwhen
you knew that I was not alone?â€

This was spoken with a burst of impatience, as if she had felt that
Rashleighâ€™s air of caution and reserve covered some insinuation of
impertinent suspicion. â€œYou have taught me the form of knocking at this
door so perfectly, my fair cousin,â€ answered Rashleigh, without change of
voice or manner, â€œthat habit has become a second nature.â€

â€œI prize sincerity more than courtesy, sir, and you know I do,â€ was Miss
Vernonâ€™s reply.

â€œCourtesy is a gallant gay, a courtier by name and by profession,â€
 replied Rashleigh, â€œand therefore most fit for a ladyâ€™s bower.â€

â€œBut Sincerity is the true knight,â€ retorted Miss Vernon, â€œand therefore
much more welcome, cousin. But to end a debate not over amusing to your
stranger kinsman, sit down, Rashleigh, and give Mr. Francis Osbaldistone
your countenance to his glass of wine. I have done the honours of the
dinner, for the credit of Osbaldistone Hall.â€

Rashleigh sate down, and filled his glass, glancing his eye from Diana to
me, with an embarrassment which his utmost efforts could not entirely
disguise. I thought he appeared to be uncertain concerning the extent of
confidence she might have reposed in me, and hastened to lead the
conversation into a channel which should sweep away his suspicion that
Diana might have betrayed any secrets which rested between them. â€œMiss
Vernon,â€ I said, â€œMr. Rashleigh, has recommended me to return my thanks
to you for my speedy disengagement from the ridiculous accusation of
Morris; and, unjustly fearing my gratitude might not be warm enough to
remind me of this duty, she has put my curiosity on its side, by
referring me to you for an account, or rather explanation, of the events
of the day.â€

â€œIndeed?â€ answered Rashleigh; â€œI should have thoughtâ€ (looking keenly at
Miss Vernon) â€œthat the lady herself might have stood interpreter;â€ and
his eye, reverting from her face, sought mine, as if to search, from the
expression of my features, whether Dianaâ€™s communication had been as
narrowly limited as my words had intimated. Miss Vernon retorted his
inquisitorial glance with one of decided scorn; while I, uncertain
whether to deprecate or resent his obvious suspicion, replied, â€œIf it is
your pleasure, Mr. Rashleigh, as it has been Miss Vernonâ€™s, to leave me
in ignorance, I must necessarily submit; but, pray, do not withhold your
information from me on the ground of imagining that I have already
obtained any on the subject. For I tell you, as a man of honour, I am as
ignorant as that picture of anything relating to the events I have
witnessed to-day, excepting that I understand from Miss Vernon, that you
have been kindly active in my favour.â€

â€œMiss Vernon has overrated my humble efforts,â€ said Rashleigh, â€œthough I
claim full credit for my zeal. The truth is, that as I galloped back to
get some one of our family to join me in becoming your bail, which was
the most obvious, or, indeed, I may say, the only way of serving you
which occurred to my stupidity, I met the man Cawmil--Colville--Campbell,
or whatsoever they call him. I had understood from Morris that he was
present when the robbery took place, and had the good fortune to prevail
on him (with some difficulty, I confess) to tender his evidence in your
exculpation--which I presume was the means of your being released from an
unpleasant situation.â€

â€œIndeed?--I am much your debtor for procuring such a seasonable evidence
in my behalf. But I cannot see why (having been, as he said, a
fellow-sufferer with Morris) it should have required much trouble to
persuade him to step forth and bear evidence, whether to convict the
actual robber, or free an innocent person.â€

â€œYou do not know the genius of that manâ€™s country, sir,â€ answered
Rashleigh;--â€œdiscretion, prudence, and foresight, are their leading
qualities; these are only modified by a narrow-spirited, but yet ardent
patriotism, which forms as it were the outmost of the concentric bulwarks
with which a Scotchman fortifies himself against all the attacks of a
generous philanthropical principle. Surmount this mound, you find an
inner and still dearer barrier--the love of his province, his village,
or, most probably, his clan; storm this second obstacle, you have a
third--his attachment to his own family--his father, mother, sons,
daughters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, to the ninth generation. It is
within these limits that a Scotchmanâ€™s social affection expands itself,
never reaching those which are outermost, till all means of discharging
itself in the interior circles have been exhausted. It is within these
circles that his heart throbs, each pulsation being fainter and fainter,
till, beyond the widest boundary, it is almost unfelt. And what is worst
of all, could you surmount all these concentric outworks, you have an
inner citadel, deeper, higher, and more efficient than them all--a
Scotchmanâ€™s love for himself.â€

â€œAll this is extremely eloquent and metaphorical, Rashleigh,â€ said Miss
Vernon, who listened with unrepressed impatience; â€œthere are only two
objections to it: first, it is _not_ true; secondly, if true, it is
nothing to the purpose.â€

â€œIt _is_ true, my fairest Diana,â€ returned Rashleigh; â€œand moreover, it
is most instantly to the purpose. It is true, because you cannot deny
that I know the country and people intimately, and the character is drawn
from deep and accurate consideration--and it is to the purpose, because
it answers Mr. Francis Osbaldistoneâ€™s question, and shows why this same
wary Scotchman, considering our kinsman to be neither his countryman, nor
a Campbell, nor his cousin in any of the inextricable combinations by
which they extend their pedigree; and, above all, seeing no prospect of
personal advantage, but, on the contrary, much hazard of loss of time and
delay of businessâ€--

â€œWith other inconveniences, perhaps, of a nature yet more formidable,â€
 interrupted Miss Vernon.

â€œOf which, doubtless, there might be many,â€ said Rashleigh, continuing in
the same tone--â€œIn short, my theory shows why this man, hoping for no
advantage, and afraid of some inconvenience, might require a degree of
persuasion ere he could be prevailed on to give his testimony in favour
of Mr. Osbaldistone.â€

â€œIt seems surprising to me,â€ I observed, â€œthat during the glance I cast
over the declaration, or whatever it is termed, of Mr. Morris, he should
never have mentioned that Campbell was in his company when he met the
marauders.â€

â€œI understood from Campbell, that he had taken his solemn promise not to
mention that circumstance,â€ replied Rashleigh: â€œhis reason for exacting
such an engagement you may guess from what I have hinted--he wished to
get back to his own country, undelayed and unembarrassed by any of the
judicial inquiries which he would have been under the necessity of
attending, had the fact of his being present at the robbery taken air
while he was on this side of the Border. But let him once be as distant
as the Forth, Morris will, I warrant you, come forth with all he knows
about him, and, it may be, a good deal more. Besides, Campbell is a very
extensive dealer in cattle, and has often occasion to send great droves
into Northumberland; and, when driving such a trade, he would be a great
fool to embroil himself with our Northumbrian thieves, than whom no men
who live are more vindictive.â€

â€œI dare be sworn of that,â€ said Miss Vernon, with a tone which implied
something more than a simple acquiescence in the proposition.

â€œStill,â€ said I, resuming the subject, â€œallowing the force of the reasons
which Campbell might have for desiring that Morris should be silent with
regard to his promise when the robbery was committed, I cannot yet see
how he could attain such an influence over the man, as to make him
suppress his evidence in that particular, at the manifest risk of
subjecting his story to discredit.â€

Rashleigh agreed with me, that it was very extraordinary, and seemed to
regret that he had not questioned the Scotchman more closely on that
subject, which he allowed looked extremely mysterious. â€œBut,â€ he asked,
immediately after this acquiescence, â€œare you very sure the circumstance
of Morrisâ€™s being accompanied by Campbell is really not alluded to in his
examination?â€

â€œI read the paper over hastily,â€ said I; â€œbut it is my strong impression
that no such circumstance is mentioned;--at least, it must have been
touched on very slightly, since it failed to catch my attention.â€

â€œTrue, true,â€ answered Rashleigh, forming his own inference while he
adopted my words; â€œI incline to think with you, that the circumstance
must in reality have been mentioned, but so slightly that it failed to
attract your attention. And then, as to Campbellâ€™s interest with Morris,
I incline to suppose that it must have been gained by playing upon his
fears. This chicken-hearted fellow, Morris, is bound, I understand, for
Scotland, destined for some little employment under Government; and,
possessing the courage of the wrathful dove, or most magnanimous mouse,
he may have been afraid to encounter the ill-will of such a kill-cow as
Campbell, whose very appearance would be enough to fright him out of his
little wits. You observed that Mr. Campbell has at times a keen and
animated manner--something of a martial cast in his tone and bearing.â€

â€œI own,â€ I replied, â€œthat his expression struck me as being occasionally
fierce and sinister, and little adapted to his peaceable professions. Has
he served in the army?â€

â€œYes--no--not, strictly speaking, _served;_ but he has been, I believe,
like most of his countrymen, trained to arms. Indeed, among the hills,
they carry them from boyhood to the grave. So, if you know anything of
your fellow-traveller, you will easily judge, that, going to such a
country, he will take cue to avoid a quarrel, if he can help it, with any
of the natives. But, come, I see you decline your wine--and I too am a
degenerate Osbaldistone, so far as respects the circulation of the
bottle. If you will go to my room, I will hold you a hand at piquet.â€

We rose to take leave of Miss Vernon, who had from time to time
suppressed, apparently with difficulty, a strong temptation to break in
upon Rashleighâ€™s details. As we were about to leave the room, the
smothered fire broke forth.

â€œMr. Osbaldistone,â€ she said, â€œyour own observation will enable you to
verify the justice, or injustice, of Rashleighâ€™s suggestions concerning
such individuals as Mr. Campbell and Mr. Morris. But, in slandering
Scotland, he has borne false witness against a whole country; and I
request you will allow no weight to his evidence.â€

â€œPerhaps,â€ I answered, â€œI may find it somewhat difficult to obey your
injunction, Miss Vernon; for I must own I was bred up with no very
favourable idea of our northern neighbours.â€

â€œDistrust that part of your education, sir,â€ she replied, â€œand let the
daughter of a Scotchwoman pray you to respect the land which gave her
parent birth, until your own observation has proved them to be unworthy
of your good opinion. Preserve your hatred and contempt for
dissimulation, baseness, and falsehood, wheresoever they are to be met
with. You will find enough of all without leaving England.--Adieu,
gentlemen, I wish you good evening.â€

And she signed to the door, with the manner of a princess dismissing her
train.

We retired to Rashleighâ€™s apartment, where a servant brought us coffee
and cards. I had formed my resolution to press Rashleigh no farther on
the events of the day. A mystery, and, as I thought, not of a favourable
complexion, appeared to hang over his conduct; but to ascertain if my
suspicions were just, it was necessary to throw him off his guard. We cut
for the deal, and were soon earnestly engaged in our play. I thought I
perceived in this trifling for amusement (for the stake which Rashleigh
proposed was a mere trifle) something of a fierce and ambitious temper.
He seemed perfectly to understand the beautiful game at which he played,
but preferred, as it were on principle, the risking bold and precarious
strokes to the ordinary rules of play; and neglecting the minor and
better-balanced chances of the game, he hazarded everything for the
chance of piqueing, repiqueing, or capoting his adversary. So soon as the
intervention of a game or two at piquet, like the music between the acts
of a drama, had completely interrupted our previous course of
conversation, Rashleigh appeared to tire of the game, and the cards were
superseded by discourse, in which he assumed the lead.

More learned than soundly wise--better acquainted with menâ€™s minds than
with the moral principles that ought to regulate them, he had still
powers of conversation which I have rarely seen equalled, never excelled.
Of this his manner implied some consciousness; at least, it appeared to
me that he had studied hard to improve his natural advantages of a
melodious voice, fluent and happy expression, apt language, and fervid
imagination. He was never loud, never overbearing, never so much occupied
with his own thoughts as to outrun either the patience or the
comprehension of those he conversed with. His ideas succeeded each other
with the gentle but unintermitting flow of a plentiful and bounteous
spring; while I have heard those of others, who aimed at distinction in
conversation, rush along like the turbid gush from the sluice of a
mill-pond, as hurried, and as easily exhausted. It was late at night ere
I could part from a companion so fascinating; and, when I gained my own
apartment, it cost me no small effort to recall to my mind the character
of Rashleigh, such as I had pictured him previous to this
_tete-a-tete._

So effectual, my dear Tresham, does the sense of being pleased and amused
blunt our faculties of perception and discrimination of character, that I
can only compare it to the taste of certain fruits, at once luscious and
poignant, which renders our palate totally unfit for relishing or
distinguishing the viands which are subsequently subjected to its
criticism.





CHAPTER ELEVENTH.

                  What gars ye gaunt, my merrymen aâ€™?
                      What gars ye look sae dreary?
                  What gars ye hing your head sae sair
                      In the castle of Balwearie?
                                      Old Scotch Ballad.

The next morning chanced to be Sunday, a day peculiarly hard to be got
rid of at Osbaldistone Hall; for after the formal religious service of
the morning had been performed, at which all the family regularly
attended, it was hard to say upon which individual, Rashleigh and Miss
Vernon excepted, the fiend of ennui descended with the most abundant
outpouring of his spirit. To speak of my yesterdayâ€™s embarrassment amused
Sir Hildebrand for several minutes, and he congratulated me on my
deliverance from Morpeth or Hexham jail, as he would have done if I had
fallen in attempting to clear a five-barred gate, and got up without
hurting myself.

â€œHast had a lucky turn, lad; but do na be over venturous again. What,
man! the kingâ€™s road is free to all men, be they Whigs, be they Tories.â€

â€œOn my word, sir, I am innocent of interrupting it; and it is the most
provoking thing on earth, that every person will take it for granted that
I am accessory to a crime which I despise and detest, and which would,
moreover, deservedly forfeit my life to the laws of my country.â€

â€œWell, well, lad; even so be it; I ask no questions--no man bound to tell
on himsell--thatâ€™s fair play, or the devilâ€™s inâ€™t.â€

Rashleigh here came to my assistance; but I could not help thinking that
his arguments were calculated rather as hints to his father to put on a
show of acquiescence in my declaration of innocence, than fully to
establish it.

â€œIn your own house, my dear sir--and your own nephew--you will not surely
persist in hurting his feelings by seeming to discredit what he is so
strongly interested in affirming. No doubt, you are fully deserving of
all his confidence, and I am sure, were there anything you could do to
assist him in this strange affair, he would have recourse to your
goodness. But my cousin Frank has been dismissed as an innocent man, and
no one is entitled to suppose him otherwise. For my part, I have not the
least doubt of his innocence; and our family honour, I conceive, requires
that we should maintain it with tongue and sword against the whole
country.â€

â€œRashleigh,â€ said his father, looking fixedly at him, â€œthou art a sly
loon--thou hast ever been too cunning for me, and too cunning for most
folks. Have a care thou provena too cunning for thysell--two faces under
one hood is no true heraldry. And since we talk of heraldry, Iâ€™ll go and
read Gwillym.â€

This resolution he intimated with a yawn, resistless as that of the
Goddess in the Dunciad, which was responsively echoed by his giant sons,
as they dispersed in quest of the pastimes to which their minds severally
inclined them--Percie to discuss a pot of March beer with the steward in
the buttery,--Thorncliff to cut a pair of cudgels, and fix them in their
wicker hilts,--John to dress May-flies,--Dickon to play at pitch and toss
by himself, his right hand against his left,--and Wilfred to bite his
thumbs and hum himself into a slumber which should last till dinner-time,
if possible. Miss Vernon had retired to the library.

Rashleigh and I were left alone in the old hall, from which the servants,
with their usual bustle and awkwardness, had at length contrived to hurry
the remains of our substantial breakfast. I took the opportunity to
upbraid him with the manner in which he had spoken of my affair to his
father, which I frankly stated was highly offensive to me, as it seemed
rather to exhort Sir Hildebrand to conceal his suspicions, than to root
them out.

â€œWhy, what can I do, my dear friend?â€ replied Rashleigh â€œmy fatherâ€™s
disposition is so tenacious of suspicions of all kinds, when once they
take root (which, to do him justice, does not easily happen), that I have
always found it the best way to silence him upon such subjects, instead
of arguing with him. Thus I get the better of the weeds which I cannot
eradicate, by cutting them over as often as they appear, until at length
they die away of themselves. There is neither wisdom nor profit in
disputing with such a mind as Sir Hildebrandâ€™s, which hardens itself
against conviction, and believes in its own inspirations as firmly as we
good Catholics do in those of the Holy Father of Rome.â€

â€œIt is very hard, though, that I should live in the house of a man, and
he a near relation too, who will persist in believing me guilty of a
highway robbery.â€

â€œMy fatherâ€™s foolish opinion, if one may give that epithet to any opinion
of a fatherâ€™s, does not affect your real innocence; and as to the
disgrace of the fact, depend on it, that, considered in all its bearings,
political as well as moral, Sir Hildebrand regards it as a meritorious
action--a weakening of the enemy--a spoiling of the Amalekites; and you
will stand the higher in his regard for your supposed accession to it.â€

â€œI desire no manâ€™s regard, Mr. Rashleigh, on such terms as must sink me
in my own; and I think these injurious suspicions will afford a very good
reason for quitting Osbaldistone Hall, which I shall do whenever I can
communicate on the subject with my father.â€

The dark countenance of Rashleigh, though little accustomed to betray its
masterâ€™s feelings, exhibited a suppressed smile, which he instantly
chastened by a sigh. â€œYou are a happy man, Frank--you go and come, as the
wind bloweth where it listeth. With your address, taste, and talents, you
will soon find circles where they will be more valued, than amid the dull
inmates of this mansion; while I--â€ he paused.

â€œAnd what is there in your lot that can make you or any one envy
mine,--an outcast, as I may almost term myself, from my fatherâ€™s house
and favour?â€

â€œAy, but,â€ answered Rashleigh, â€œconsider the gratified sense of
independence which you must have attained by a very temporary
sacrifice,--for such I am sure yours will prove to be; consider the
power of acting as a free agent, of cultivating your own talents in the
way to which your taste determines you, and in which you are well
qualified to distinguish yourself. Fame and freedom are cheaply
purchased by a few weeksâ€™ residence in the North, even though your place
of exile be Osbaldistone Hall. A second Ovid in Thrace, you have not his
reasons for writing Tristia.â€

â€œI do not know,â€ said I, blushing as became a young scribbler, â€œhow you
should be so well acquainted with my truant studies.â€

â€œThere was an emissary of your fatherâ€™s here some time since, a young
coxcomb, one Twineall, who informed me concerning your secret sacrifices
to the muses, and added, that some of your verses had been greatly
admired by the best judges.â€

Tresham, I believe you are guiltless of having ever essayed to build the
lofty rhyme; but you must have known in your day many an apprentice and
fellow-craft, if not some of the master-masons, in the temple of Apollo.
Vanity is their universal foible, from him who decorated the shades of
Twickenham, to the veriest scribbler whom he has lashed in his Dunciad. I
had my own share of this common failing, and without considering how
little likely this young fellow Twineall was, by taste and habits, either
to be acquainted with one or two little pieces of poetry, which I had at
times insinuated into Buttonâ€™s coffee-house, or to report the opinion of
the critics who frequented that resort of wit and literature, I almost
instantly gorged the bait; which Rashleigh perceiving, improved his
opportunity by a diffident, yet apparently very anxious request to be
permitted to see some of my manuscript productions.

â€œYou shall give me an evening in my own apartment,â€ he continued; â€œfor I
must soon lose the charms of literary society for the drudgery of
commerce, and the coarse every-day avocations of the world. I repeat it,
that my compliance with my fatherâ€™s wishes for the advantage of my
family, is indeed a sacrifice, especially considering the calm and
peaceful profession to which my education destined me.â€

I was vain, but not a fool, and this hypocrisy was too strong for me to
swallow. â€œYou would not persuade me,â€ I replied, â€œthat you really regret
to exchange the situation of an obscure Catholic priest, with all its
privations, for wealth and society, and the pleasures of the world?â€

Rashleigh saw that he had coloured his affectation of moderation too
highly, and, after a secondâ€™s pause, during which, I suppose, he
calculated the degree of candour which it was necessary to use with me
(that being a quality of which he was never needlessly profuse), he
answered, with a smile--â€œAt my age, to be condemned, as you say, to
wealth and the world, does not, indeed, sound so alarming as perhaps it
ought to do. But, with pardon be it spoken, you have mistaken my
destination--a Catholic priest, if you will, but not an obscure one. No,
sir,--Rashleigh Osbaldistone will be more obscure, should he rise to be
the richest citizen in London, than he might have been as a member of a
church, whose ministers, as some one says, â€˜set their sandallâ€™d feet on
princes.â€™ My family interest at a certain exiled court is high, and the
weight which that court ought to possess, and does possess, at Rome is
yet higher--my talents not altogether inferior to the education I have
received. In sober judgment, I might have looked forward to high eminence
in the church--in the dream of fancy, to the very highest. Why might
notâ€--(he added, laughing, for it was part of his manner to keep much of
his discourse apparently betwixt jest and earnest)--â€œwhy might not
Cardinal Osbaldistone have swayed the fortunes of empires, well-born and
well-connected, as well as the low-born Mazarin, or Alberoni, the son of
an Italian gardener?â€

â€œNay, I can give you no reason to the contrary; but in your place I
should not much regret losing the chance of such precarious and invidious
elevation.â€

â€œNeither would I,â€ he replied, â€œwere I sure that my present establishment
was more certain; but that must depend upon circumstances which I can
only learn by experience--the disposition of your father, for example.â€

â€œConfess the truth without finesse, Rashleigh; you would willingly know
something of him from me?â€

â€œSince, like Die Vernon, you make a point of following the banner of the
good knight Sincerity, I reply--certainly.â€

â€œWell, then, you will find in my father a man who has followed the paths
of thriving more for the exercise they afforded to his talents, than for
the love of the gold with which they are strewed. His active mind would
have been happy in any situation which gave it scope for exertion, though
that exertion had been its sole reward. But his wealth has accumulated,
because, moderate and frugal in his habits, no new sources of expense
have occurred to dispose of his increasing income. He is a man who hates
dissimulation in others; never practises it himself; and is peculiarly
alert in discovering motives through the colouring of language. Himself
silent by habit, he is readily disgusted by great talkers; the rather,
that the circumstances by which he is most interested, afford no great
scope for conversation. He is severely strict in the duties of religion;
but you have no reason to fear his interference with yours, for he
regards toleration as a sacred principle of political economy. But if you
have any Jacobitical partialities, as is naturally to be supposed, you
will do well to suppress them in his presence, as well as the least
tendency to the highflying or Tory principles; for he holds both in utter
detestation. For the rest, his word is his own bond, and must be the law
of all who act under him. He will fail in his duty to no one, and will
permit no one to fail towards him; to cultivate his favour, you must
execute his commands, instead of echoing his sentiments. His greatest
failings arise out of prejudices connected with his own profession, or
rather his exclusive devotion to it, which makes him see little worthy of
praise or attention, unless it be in some measure connected with
commerce.â€

â€œO rare-painted portrait!â€ exclaimed Rashleigh, when I was
silent--â€œVandyke was a dauber to you, Frank. I see thy sire before me in
all his strength and weakness; loving and honouring the King as a sort
of lord mayor of the empire, or chief of the board of trade--venerating
the Commons, for the acts regulating the export trade--and respecting
the Peers, because the Lord Chancellor sits on a woolsack.â€

â€œMine was a likeness, Rashleigh; yours is a caricature. But in return for
the _carte du pays_ which I have unfolded to you, give me some lights on
the geography of the unknown landsâ€--

â€œOn which you are wrecked,â€ said Rashleigh. â€œIt is not worth while; it is
no Isle of Calypso, umbrageous with shade and intricate with silvan
labyrinth--but a bare ragged Northumbrian moor, with as little to
interest curiosity as to delight the eye; you may descry it in all its
nakedness in half an hourâ€™s survey, as well as if I were to lay it down
before you by line and compass.â€

â€œO, but something there is, worthy a more attentive survey--What say you
to Miss Vernon? Does not she form an interesting object in the landscape,
were all round as rude as Icelandâ€™s coast?â€

I could plainly perceive that Rashleigh disliked the topic now presented
to him; but my frank communication had given me the advantageous title to
make inquiries in my turn. Rashleigh felt this, and found himself obliged
to follow my lead, however difficult he might find it to play his cards
successfully. â€œI have known less of Miss Vernon,â€ he said, â€œfor some
time, than I was wont to do formerly. In early age I was her tutor; but
as she advanced towards womanhood, my various avocations,--the gravity of
the profession to which I was destined,--the peculiar nature of her
engagements,--our mutual situation, in short, rendered a close and
constant intimacy dangerous and improper. I believe Miss Vernon might
consider my reserve as unkindness, but it was my duty; I felt as much as
she seemed to do, when compelled to give way to prudence. But where was
the safety in cultivating an intimacy with a beautiful and susceptible
girl, whose heart, you are aware, must be given either to the cloister or
to a betrothed husband?â€

â€œThe cloister or a betrothed husband?â€ I echoed--â€œIs that the alternative
destined for Miss Vernon?â€

â€œIt is indeed,â€ said Rashleigh, with a sigh. â€œI need not, I suppose,
caution you against the danger of cultivating too closely the friendship
of Miss Vernon;--you are a man of the world, and know how far you can
indulge yourself in her society with safety to yourself, and justice to
her. But I warn you, that, considering her ardent temper, you must let
your experience keep guard over her as well as yourself, for the specimen
of yesterday may serve to show her extreme thoughtlessness and neglect of
decorum.â€

There was something, I was sensible, of truth, as well as good sense, in
all this; it seemed to be given as a friendly warning, and I had no right
to take it amiss; yet I felt I could with pleasure have run Rashleigh
Osbaldistone through the body all the time he was speaking.

â€œThe deuce take his insolence!â€ was my internal meditation. â€œWould he
wish me to infer that Miss Vernon had fallen in love with that
hatchet-face of his, and become degraded so low as to require his shyness
to cure her of an imprudent passion? I will have his meaning from him,â€
 was my resolution, â€œif I should drag it out with cart-ropes.â€

For this purpose, I placed my temper under as accurate a guard as I
could, and observed, â€œThat, for a lady of her good sense and acquired
accomplishments, it was to be regretted that Miss Vernonâ€™s manners were
rather blunt and rustic.â€

â€œFrank and unreserved, at least, to the extreme,â€ replied Rashleigh:
â€œyet, trust me, she has an excellent heart. To tell you the truth, should
she continue her extreme aversion to the cloister, and to her destined
husband, and should my own labours in the mine of Plutus promise to
secure me a decent independence, I shall think of reviewing our
acquaintance and sharing it with Miss Vernon.â€

â€œWith all his fine voice, and well-turned periods,â€ thought I, â€œthis same
Rashleigh Osbaldistone is the ugliest and most conceited coxcomb I ever
met with!â€

â€œBut,â€ continued Rashleigh, as if thinking aloud, â€œI should not like to
supplant Thorncliff.â€

â€œSupplant Thorncliff!--Is your brother Thorncliff,â€ I inquired, with
great surprise, â€œthe destined husband of Diana Vernon?â€

â€œWhy, ay, her fatherâ€™s commands, and a certain family-contract, destined
her to marry one of Sir Hildebrandâ€™s sons. A dispensation has been
obtained from Rome to Diana Vernon to marry _Blank_ Osbaldistone, Esq.,
son of Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone, of Osbaldistone Hall, Bart., and so
forth; and it only remains to pitch upon the happy man whose name shall
fill the gap in the manuscript. Now, as Percie is seldom sober, my father
pitched on Thorncliff, as the second prop of the family, and therefore
most proper to carry on the line of the Osbaldistones.â€

â€œThe young lady,â€ said I, forcing myself to assume an air of pleasantry,
which, I believe, became me extremely ill, â€œwould perhaps have been
inclined to look a little lower on the family-tree, for the branch to
which she was desirous of clinging.â€

â€œI cannot say,â€ he replied. â€œThere is room for little choice in our
family; Dick is a gambler, John a boor, and Wilfred an ass. I believe my
father really made the best selection for poor Die, after all.â€

â€œThe present company,â€ said I, â€œbeing always excepted.â€

â€œOh, my destination to the church placed me out of the question;
otherwise I will not affect to say, that, qualified by my education both
to instruct and guide Miss Vernon, I might not have been a more
creditable choice than any of my elders.â€

â€œAnd so thought the young lady, doubtless?â€

â€œYou are not to suppose so,â€ answered Rashleigh, with an affectation of
denial which was contrived to convey the strongest affirmation the case
admitted of: â€œfriendship--only friendship--formed the tie betwixt us, and
the tender affection of an opening mind to its only instructor--Love came
not near us--I told you I was wise in time.â€

I felt little inclination to pursue this conversation any farther, and
shaking myself clear of Rashleigh, withdrew to my own apartment, which I
recollect I traversed with much vehemence of agitation, repeating aloud
the expressions which had most offended me.--â€œSusceptible--ardent--tender
affection--Love--Diana Vernon, the most beautiful creature I ever beheld,
in love with him, the bandy-legged, bull-necked, limping scoundrel!
Richard the Third in all but his hump-back!--And yet the opportunities he
must have had during his cursed course of lectures; and the fellowâ€™s
flowing and easy strain of sentiment; and her extreme seclusion from
every one who spoke and acted with common sense; ay, and her obvious
pique at him, mixed with admiration of his talents, which looked as like
the result of neglected attachment as anything else--Well, and what is it
to me, that I should storm and rage at it? Is Diana Vernon the first
pretty girl that has loved and married an ugly fellow? And if she were
free of every Osbaldistone of them, what concern is it of mine?--a
Catholic--a Jacobite--a termagant into the boot--for me to look that way
were utter madness.â€

By throwing such reflections on the flame of my displeasure, I subdued it
into a sort of smouldering heart-burning, and appeared at the
dinner-table in as sulky a humour as could well be imagined.





CHAPTER TWELFTH.

          Drunk?--and speak parrot?--and squabble?--swagger?--
          Swear?--and discourse fustian with oneâ€™s own shadow?
                                           Othello.

I have already told you, my dear Tresham, what probably was no news to
you, that my principal fault was an unconquerable pitch of pride, which
exposed me to frequent mortification. I had not even whispered to myself
that I loved Diana Vernon; yet no sooner did I hear Rashleigh talk of her
as a prize which he might stoop to carry off, or neglect, at his
pleasure, than every step which the poor girl had taken, in the innocence
and openness of her heart, to form a sort of friendship with me, seemed
in my eyes the most insulting coquetry.--â€œSoh! she would secure me as a
_pis aller,_ I suppose, in case Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone should not
take compassion upon her! But I will satisfy her that I am not a person
to be trepanned in that manner--I will make her sensible that I see
through her arts, and that I scorn them.â€

I did not reflect for a moment, that all this indignation, which I had no
right whatever to entertain, proved that I was anything but indifferent
to Miss Vernonâ€™s charms; and I sate down to table in high ill-humour with
her and all the daughters of Eve.

Miss Vernon heard me, with surprise, return ungracious answers to one or
two playful strokes of satire which she threw out with her usual freedom
of speech; but, having no suspicion that offence was meant, she only
replied to my rude repartees with jests somewhat similar, but polished by
her good temper, though pointed by her wit. At length she perceived I was
really out of humour, and answered one of my rude speeches thus:--

â€œThey say, Mr. Frank, that one may gather sense from fools--I heard
cousin Wilfred refuse to play any longer at cudgels the other day with
cousin Thornie, because cousin Thornie got angry, and struck harder than
the rules of amicable combat, it seems, permitted. â€˜Were I to break your
head in good earnest,â€™ quoth honest Wilfred, â€˜I care not how angry you
are, for I should do it so much the more easily but itâ€™s hard I should
get raps over the costard, and only pay you back in make-believesâ€™--Do
you understand the moral of this, Frank?â€

â€œI have never felt myself under the necessity, madam, of studying how to
extract the slender portion of sense with which this family season their
conversation.â€

â€œNecessity! and madam!--You surprise me, Mr. Osbaldistone.â€

â€œI am unfortunate in doing so.â€

â€œAm I to suppose that this capricious tone is serious? or is it only
assumed, to make your good-humour more valuable?â€

â€œYou have a right to the attention of so many gentlemen in this family,
Miss Vernon, that it cannot be worth your while to inquire into the cause
of my stupidity and bad spirits.â€

â€œWhat!â€ she said, â€œam I to understand, then, that you have deserted my
faction, and gone over to the enemy?â€

Then, looking across the table, and observing that Rashleigh, who was
seated opposite, was watching us with a singular expression of interest
on his harsh features, she continued--

             â€œHorrible thought!--Ay, now I see â€˜tis true,
              For the grim-visaged Rashleigh smiles on me,
                     And points at thee for his!--

Well, thank Heaven, and the unprotected state which has taught me
endurance, I do not take offence easily; and that I may not be forced to
quarrel, whether I like it or no, I have the honour, earlier than usual,
to wish you a happy digestion of your dinner and your bad humour.â€

And she left the table accordingly.

Upon Miss Vernonâ€™s departure, I found myself very little satisfied with
my own conduct. I had hurled back offered kindness, of which
circumstances had but lately pointed out the honest sincerity, and I had
but just stopped short of insulting the beautiful, and, as she had said
with some emphasis, the unprotected being by whom it was proffered. My
conduct seemed brutal in my own eyes. To combat or drown these painful
reflections, I applied myself more frequently than usual to the wine
which circulated on the table.

The agitated state of my feelings combined with my habits of temperance
to give rapid effect to the beverage. Habitual topers, I believe, acquire
the power of soaking themselves with a quantity of liquor that does
little more than muddy those intellects which in their sober state are
none of the clearest; but men who are strangers to the vice of
drunkenness as a habit, are more powerfully acted upon by intoxicating
liquors. My spirits, once aroused, became extravagant; I talked a great
deal, argued upon what I knew nothing of, told stories of which I forgot
the point, then laughed immoderately at my own forgetfulness; I accepted
several bets without having the least judgment; I challenged the giant
John to wrestle with me, although he had kept the ring at Hexham for a
year, and I never tried so much as a single fall.

My uncle had the goodness to interpose and prevent this consummation of
drunken folly, which, I suppose, would have otherwise ended in my neck
being broken.

It has even been reported by maligners, that I sung a song while under
this vinous influence; but, as I remember nothing of it, and never
attempted to turn a tune in all my life before or since, I would
willingly hope there is no actual foundation for the calumny. I was
absurd enough without this exaggeration. Without positively losing my
senses, I speedily lost all command of my temper, and my impetuous
passions whirled me onward at their pleasure. I had sate down sulky and
discontented, and disposed to be silent--the wine rendered me loquacious,
disputatious, and quarrelsome. I contradicted whatever was asserted, and
attacked, without any respect to my uncleâ€™s table, both his politics and
his religion. The affected moderation of Rashleigh, which he well knew
how to qualify with irritating ingredients, was even more provoking to me
than the noisy and bullying language of his obstreperous brothers. My
uncle, to do him justice, endeavoured to bring us to order; but his
authority was lost amidst the tumult of wine and passion. At length,
frantic at some real or supposed injurious insinuation, I actually struck
Rashleigh with my fist. No Stoic philosopher, superior to his own passion
and that of others, could have received an insult with a higher degree of
scorn. What he himself did not think it apparently worth while to resent,
Thorncliff resented for him. Swords were drawn, and we exchanged one or
two passes, when the other brothers separated us by main force; and I
shall never forget the diabolical sneer which writhed Rashleighâ€™s wayward
features, as I was forced from the apartment by the main strength of two
of these youthful Titans. They secured me in my apartment by locking the
door, and I heard them, to my inexpressible rage, laugh heartily as they
descended the stairs. I essayed in my fury to break out; but the
window-grates, and the strength of a door clenched with iron, resisted my
efforts. At length I threw myself on my bed, and fell asleep amidst vows
of dire revenge to be taken in the ensuing day.

But with the morning cool repentance came. I felt, in the keenest manner,
the violence and absurdity of my conduct, and was obliged to confess that
wine and passion had lowered my intellects even below those of Wilfred
Osbaldistone, whom I held in so much contempt. My uncomfortable
reflections were by no means soothed by meditating the necessity of an
apology for my improper behaviour, and recollecting that Miss Vernon must
be a witness of my submission. The impropriety and unkindness of my
conduct to her personally, added not a little to these galling
considerations, and for this I could not even plead the miserable excuse
of intoxication.

Under all these aggravating feelings of shame and degradation, I
descended to the breakfast hall, like a criminal to receive sentence. It
chanced that a hard frost had rendered it impossible to take out the
hounds, so that I had the additional mortification to meet the family,
excepting only Rashleigh and Miss Vernon, in full divan, surrounding the
cold venison pasty and chine of beef. They were in high glee as I
entered, and I could easily imagine that the jests were furnished at my
expense. In fact, what I was disposed to consider with serious pain, was
regarded as an excellent good joke by my uncle, and the greater part of
my cousins. Sir Hildebrand, while he rallied me on the exploits of the
preceding evening, swore he thought a young fellow had better be thrice
drunk in one day, than sneak sober to bed like a Presbyterian, and leave
a batch of honest fellows, and a double quart of claret. And to back this
consolatory speech, he poured out a large bumper of brandy, exhorting me
to swallow â€œa hair of the dog that had bit me.â€

â€œNever mind these lads laughing, nevoy,â€ he continued; â€œthey would have
been all as great milksops as yourself, had I not nursed them, as one may
say, on the toast and tankard.â€

Ill-nature was not the fault of my cousins in general; they saw I was
vexed and hurt at the recollections of the preceding evening, and
endeavoured, with clumsy kindness, to remove the painful impression they
had made on me. Thorncliff alone looked sullen and unreconciled. This
young man had never liked me from the beginning; and in the marks of
attention occasionally shown me by his brothers, awkward as they were, he
alone had never joined. If it was true, of which, however, I began to
have my doubts, that he was considered by the family, or regarded
himself, as the destined husband of Miss Vernon, a sentiment of jealousy
might have sprung up in his mind from the marked predilection which it
was that young ladyâ€™s pleasure to show for one whom Thorncliff might,
perhaps, think likely to become a dangerous rival.

Rashleigh at last entered, his visage as dark as mourning weed--brooding,
I could not but doubt, over the unjustifiable and disgraceful insult I
had offered to him. I had already settled in my own mind how I was to
behave on the occasion, and had schooled myself to believe, that true
honour consisted not in defending, but in apologising for, an injury so
much disproportioned to any provocation I might have to allege.

I therefore hastened to meet Rashleigh, and to express myself in the
highest degree sorry for the violence with which I had acted on the
preceding evening. â€œNo circumstances,â€ I said, â€œcould have wrung from me
a single word of apology, save my own consciousness of the impropriety of
my behaviour. I hoped my cousin would accept of my regrets so sincerely
offered, and consider how much of my misconduct was owing to the
excessive hospitality of Osbaldistone Hall.â€

â€œHe shall be friends with thee, lad,â€ cried the honest knight, in the
full effusion of his heart; â€œor d--n me, if I call him son more!--Why,
Rashie, dost stand there like a log? _Sorry for it_ is all a gentleman
can say, if he happens to do anything awry, especially over his claret. I
served in Hounslow, and should know something, I think, of affairs of
honour. Let me hear no more of this, and weâ€™ll go in a body and rummage
out the badger in Birkenwood-bank.â€

Rashleighâ€™s face resembled, as I have already noticed, no other
countenance that I ever saw. But this singularity lay not only in the
features, but in the mode of changing their expression. Other
countenances, in altering from grief to joy, or from anger to
satisfaction, pass through some brief interval, ere the expression of the
predominant passion supersedes entirely that of its predecessor. There is
a sort of twilight, like that between the clearing up of the darkness and
the rising of the sun, while the swollen muscles subside, the dark eye
clears, the forehead relaxes and expands itself, and the whole
countenance loses its sterner shades, and becomes serene and placid.
Rashleighâ€™s face exhibited none of these gradations, but changed almost
instantaneously from the expression of one passion to that of the
contrary. I can compare it to nothing but the sudden shifting of a scene
in the theatre, where, at the whistle of the prompter, a cavern
disappears, and a grove arises.

My attention was strongly arrested by this peculiarity on the present
occasion. At Rashleighâ€™s first entrance, â€œblack he stood as night!â€ With
the same inflexible countenance he heard my excuse and his fatherâ€™s
exhortation; and it was not until Sir Hildebrand had done speaking, that
the cloud cleared away at once, and he expressed, in the kindest and most
civil terms, his perfect satisfaction with the very handsome apology I
had offered.

â€œIndeed,â€ he said, â€œI have so poor a brain myself, when I impose on it
the least burden beyond my usual three glasses, that I have only, like
honest Cassio, a very vague recollection of the confusion of last
night--remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly--a quarrel, but
nothing wherefore--So, my dear Cousin,â€ he continued, shaking me kindly
by the hand, â€œconceive how much I am relieved by finding that I have to
receive an apology, instead of having to make one--I will not have a
word said upon the subject more; I should be very foolish to institute
any scrutiny into an account, when the balance, which I expected to be
against me, has been so unexpectedly and agreeably struck in my favour.
You see, Mr. Osbaldistone, I am practising the language of Lombard
Street, and qualifying myself for my new calling.â€

As I was about to answer, and raised my eyes for the purpose, they
encountered those of Miss Vernon, who, having entered the room unobserved
during the conversation, had given it her close attention. Abashed and
confounded, I fixed my eyes on the ground, and made my escape to the
breakfast-table, where I herded among my busy cousins.

My uncle, that the events of the preceding day might not pass out of our
memory without a practical moral lesson, took occasion to give Rashleigh
and me his serious advice to correct our milksop habits, as he termed
them, and gradually to inure our brains to bear a gentlemanlike quantity
of liquor, without brawls or breaking of heads. He recommended that we
should begin piddling with a regular quart of claret per day, which, with
the aid of March beer and brandy, made a handsome competence for a
beginner in the art of toping. And for our encouragement, he assured us
that he had known many a man who had lived to our years without having
drunk a pint of wine at a sitting, who yet, by falling into honest
company, and following hearty example, had afterwards been numbered among
the best good fellows of the time, and could carry off their six bottles
under their belt quietly and comfortably, without brawling or babbling,
and be neither sick nor sorry the next morning.

Sage as this advice was, and comfortable as was the prospect it held out
to me, I profited but little by the exhortation--partly, perhaps,
because, as often as I raised my eyes from the table, I observed Miss
Vernonâ€™s looks fixed on me, in which I thought I could read grave
compassion blended with regret and displeasure. I began to consider how I
should seek a scene of explanation and apology with her also, when she
gave me to understand she was determined to save me the trouble of
soliciting an interview. â€œCousin Francis,â€ she said, addressing me by the
same title she used to give to the other Osbaldistones, although I had,
properly speaking, no title to be called her kinsman, â€œI have encountered
this morning a difficult passage in the Divina Commeâ€™dia of Dante; will
you have the goodness to step to the library and give me your assistance?
and when you have unearthed for me the meaning of the obscure Florentine,
we will join the rest at Birkenwood-bank, and see their luck at
unearthing the badger.â€

I signified, of course, my readiness to wait upon her. Rashleigh made an
offer to accompany us. â€œI am something better skilled,â€ he said, â€œat
tracking the sense of Dante through the metaphors and elisions of his
wild and gloomy poem, than at hunting the poor inoffensive hermit yonder
out of his cave.â€

â€œPardon me, Rashleigh,â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œbut as you are to occupy Mr.
Francisâ€™s place in the counting-house, you must surrender to him the
charge of your pupilâ€™s education at Osbaldistone Hall. We shall call you
in, however, if there is any occasion; so pray do not look so grave upon
it. Besides, it is a shame to you not to understand field-sports--What
will you do should our uncle in Crane-Alley ask you the signs by which
you track a badger?â€

â€œAy, true, Die,--true,â€ said Sir Hildebrand, with a sigh, â€œI misdoubt
Rashleigh will be found short at the leap when he is put to the trial. An
he would haâ€™ learned useful knowledge like his brothers, he was bred up
where it grew, I wuss; but French antics, and book-learning, with the new
turnips, and the rats, and the Hanoverians, haâ€™ changed the world that I
haâ€™ known in Old England--But come along with us, Rashie, and carry my
hunting-staff, man; thy cousin lacks none of thy company as now, and I
wonna haâ€™ Die crossed--Itâ€™s neâ€™er be said there was but one woman in
Osbaldistone Hall, and she died for lack of her will.â€

Rashleigh followed his father, as he commanded, not, however, ere he had
whispered to Diana, â€œI suppose I must in discretion bring the courtier,
Ceremony, in my company, and knock when I approach the door of the
library?â€

â€œNo, no, Rashleigh,â€ said Miss Vernon; â€œdismiss from your company the
false archimage Dissimulation, and it will better ensure your free access
to our classical consultations.â€

So saying, she led the way to the library, and I followed--like a
criminal, I was going to say, to execution; but, as I bethink me, I have
used the simile once, if not twice before. Without any simile at all,
then, I followed, with a sense of awkward and conscious embarrassment,
which I would have given a great deal to shake off. I thought it a
degrading and unworthy feeling to attend one on such an occasion, having
breathed the air of the Continent long enough to have imbibed the notion
that lightness, gallantry, and something approaching to well-bred
self-assurance, should distinguish the gentleman whom a fair lady selects
for her companion in a _tete-a-tete._

My English feelings, however, were too many for my French education, and
I made, I believe, a very pitiful figure, when Miss Vernon, seating
herself majestically in a huge elbow-chair in the library, like a judge
about to hear a cause of importance, signed to me to take a chair
opposite to her (which I did, much like the poor fellow who is going to
be tried), and entered upon conversation in a tone of bitter irony.





CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.


              Dire was his thought, who first in poison steeped
              The weapon formed for slaughter--direr his,
                  And worthier of damnation, who instilled
                  The mortal venom in the social cup,
              To fill the veins with death instead of life.
                                                 Anonymous.

â€œUpon my Word, Mr. Francis Osbaldistone,â€ said Miss Vernon, with the air
of one who thought herself fully entitled to assume the privilege of
ironical reproach, which she was pleased to exert, â€œyour character
improves upon us, sir--I could not have thought that it was in you.
Yesterday might be considered as your assay-piece, to prove yourself
entitled to be free of the corporation of Osbaldistone Hall. But it was a
masterpiece.â€

â€œI am quite sensible of my ill-breeding, Miss Vernon, and I can only say
for myself that I had received some communications by which my spirits
were unusually agitated. I am conscious I was impertinent and absurd.â€

â€œYou do yourself great injustice,â€ said the merciless monitor--â€œyou have
contrived, by what I saw and have since heard, to exhibit in the course
of one evening a happy display of all the various masterly qualifications
which distinguish your several cousins;--the gentle and generous temper
of the benevolent Rashleigh,--the temperance of Percie,--the cool courage
of Thorncliff,--Johnâ€™s skill in dog-breaking,--Dickonâ€™s aptitude to
betting,--all exhibited by the single individual, Mr. Francis, and that
with a selection of time, place, and circumstance, worthy the taste and
sagacity of the sapient Wilfred.â€

â€œHave a little mercy, Miss Vernon,â€ said I; for I confess I thought the
schooling as severe as the case merited, especially considering from what
quarter it came, â€œand forgive me if I suggest, as an excuse for follies I
am not usually guilty of, the custom of this house and country. I am far
from approving of it; but we have Shakspeareâ€™s authority for saying, that
good wine is a good familiar creature, and that any man living may be
overtaken at some time.â€

â€œAy, Mr. Francis, but he places the panegyric and the apology in the
mouth of the greatest villain his pencil has drawn. I will not, however,
abuse the advantage your quotation has given me, by overwhelming you with
the refutation with which the victim Cassio replies to the tempter Iago.
I only wish you to know, that there is one person at least sorry to see a
youth of talents and expectations sink into the slough in which the
inhabitants of this house are nightly wallowing.â€

â€œI have but wet my shoe, I assure you, Miss Vernon, and am too sensible
of the filth of the puddle to step farther in.â€

â€œIf such be your resolution,â€ she replied, â€œit is a wise one. But I was
so much vexed at what I heard, that your concerns have pressed before my
own,--You behaved to me yesterday, during dinner, as if something had
been told you which lessened or lowered me in your opinion--I beg leave
to ask you what it was?â€

I was stupified. The direct bluntness of the demand was much in the style
one gentleman uses to another, when requesting explanation of any part of
his conduct in a good-humoured yet determined manner, and was totally
devoid of the circumlocutions, shadings, softenings, and periphrasis,
which usually accompany explanations betwixt persons of different sexes
in the higher orders of society.

I remained completely embarrassed; for it pressed on my recollection,
that Rashleighâ€™s communications, supposing them to be correct, ought to
have rendered Miss Vernon rather an object of my compassion than of my
pettish resentment; and had they furnished the best apology possible for
my own conduct, still I must have had the utmost difficulty in detailing
what inferred such necessary and natural offence to Miss Vernonâ€™s
feelings. She observed my hesitation, and proceeded, in a tone somewhat
more peremptory, but still temperate and civil--â€œI hope Mr. Osbaldistone
does not dispute my title to request this explanation. I have no relative
who can protect me; it is, therefore, just that I be permitted to protect
myself.â€

I endeavoured with hesitation to throw the blame of my rude behaviour
upon indisposition--upon disagreeable letters from London. She suffered
me to exhaust my apologies, and fairly to run myself aground, listening
all the while with a smile of absolute incredulity.

â€œAnd now, Mr. Francis, having gone through your prologue of excuses, with
the same bad grace with which all prologues are delivered, please to draw
the curtain, and show me that which I desire to see. In a word, let me
know what Rashleigh says of me; for he is the grand engineer and first
mover of all the machinery of Osbaldistone Hall.â€

â€œBut, supposing there was anything to tell, Miss Vernon, what does he
deserve that betrays the secrets of one ally to another?--Rashleigh, you
yourself told me, remained your ally, though no longer your friend.â€

â€œI have neither patience for evasion, nor inclination for jesting, on the
present subject. Rashleigh cannot--ought not--dare not, hold any language
respecting me, Diana Vernon, but what I may demand to hear repeated. That
there are subjects of secrecy and confidence between us, is most certain;
but to such, his communications to you could have no relation; and with
such, I, as an individual, have no concern.â€

I had by this time recovered my presence of mind, and hastily determined
to avoid making any disclosure of what Rashleigh had told me in a sort of
confidence. There was something unworthy in retailing private
conversation; it could, I thought, do no good, and must necessarily give
Miss Vernon great pain. I therefore replied, gravely, â€œthat nothing but
frivolous talk had passed between Mr. Rashleigh Osbaldistone and me on
the state of the family at the Hall; and I protested, that nothing had
been said which left a serious impression to her disadvantage. As a
gentleman,â€ I said, â€œI could not be more explicit in reporting private
conversation.â€

She started up with the animation of a Camilla about to advance into
battle. â€œThis shall not serve your turn, sir,--I must have another answer
from you.â€ Her features kindled--her brow became flushed--her eye glanced
wild-fire as she proceeded--â€œI demand such an explanation, as a woman
basely slandered has a right to demand from every man who calls himself a
gentleman--as a creature, motherless, friendless, alone in the world,
left to her own guidance and protection, has a right to require from
every being having a happier lot, in the name of that God who sent _them_
into the world to enjoy, and _her_ to suffer. You shall not deny me--or,â€
 she added, looking solemnly upwards, â€œyou will rue your denial, if there
is justice for wrong either on earth or in heaven.â€

I was utterly astonished at her vehemence, but felt, thus conjured, that
it became my duty to lay aside scrupulous delicacy, and gave her briefly,
but distinctly, the heads of the information which Rashleigh had conveyed
to me.

She sate down and resumed her composure, as soon as I entered upon the
subject, and when I stopped to seek for the most delicate turn of
expression, she repeatedly interrupted me with â€œGo on--pray, go on; the
first word which occurs to you is the plainest, and must be the best. Do
not think of my feelings, but speak as you would to an unconcerned third
party.â€

Thus urged and encouraged, I stammered through all the account which
Rashleigh had given of her early contract to marry an Osbaldistone, and
of the uncertainty and difficulty of her choice; and there I would
willingly have paused. But her penetration discovered that there was
still something behind, and even guessed to what it related.

â€œWell, it was ill-natured of Rashleigh to tell this tale on me. I am like
the poor girl in the fairy tale, who was betrothed in her cradle to the
Black Bear of Norway, but complained chiefly of being called Bruinâ€™s
bride by her companions at school. But besides all this, Rashleigh said
something of himself with relation to me--Did he not?â€

â€œHe certainly hinted, that were it not for the idea of supplanting his
brother, he would now, in consequence of his change of profession, be
desirous that the word Rashleigh should fill up the blank in the
dispensation, instead of the word Thorncliff.â€

â€œAy? indeed?â€ she replied--â€œwas he so very condescending?--Too much
honour for his humble handmaid, Diana Vernon--And she, I suppose, was to
be enraptured with joy could such a substitute be effected?â€

â€œTo confess the truth, he intimated as much, and even farther
insinuatedâ€--

â€œWhat?--Let me hear it all!â€ she exclaimed, hastily.

â€œThat he had broken off your mutual intimacy, lest it should have given
rise to an affection by which his destination to the church would not
permit him to profit.â€

â€œI am obliged to him for his consideration,â€ replied Miss Vernon, every
feature of her fine countenance taxed to express the most supreme degree
of scorn and contempt. She paused a moment, and then said, with her usual
composure, â€œThere is but little I have heard from you which I did not
expect to hear, and which I ought not to have expected; because, bating
one circumstance, it is all very true. But as there are some poisons so
active, that a few drops, it is said, will infect a whole fountain, so
there is one falsehood in Rashleighâ€™s communication, powerful enough to
corrupt the whole well in which Truth herself is said to have dwelt. It
is the leading and foul falsehood, that, knowing Rashleigh as I have
reason too well to know him, any circumstance on earth could make me
think of sharing my lot with him. No,â€ she continued with a sort of
inward shuddering that seemed to express involuntary horror, â€œany lot
rather than that--the sot, the gambler, the bully, the jockey, the
insensate fool, were a thousand times preferable to Rashleigh:--the
convent--the jail--the grave, shall be welcome before them all.â€

There was a sad and melancholy cadence in her voice, corresponding with
the strange and interesting romance of her situation. So young, so
beautiful, so untaught, so much abandoned to herself, and deprived of all
the support which her sex derives from the countenance and protection of
female friends, and even of that degree of defence which arises from the
forms with which the sex are approached in civilised life,--it is scarce
metaphorical to say, that my heart bled for her. Yet there was an
expression of dignity in her contempt of ceremony--of upright feeling in
her disdain of falsehood--of firm resolution in the manner in which she
contemplated the dangers by which she was surrounded, which blended my
pity with the warmest admiration. She seemed a princess deserted by her
subjects, and deprived of her power, yet still scorning those formal
regulations of society which are created for persons of an inferior rank;
and, amid her difficulties, relying boldly and confidently on the justice
of Heaven, and the unshaken constancy of her own mind.

I offered to express the mingled feelings of sympathy and admiration with
which her unfortunate situation and her high spirit combined to impress
me, but she imposed silence on me at once.

â€œI told you in jest,â€ she said, â€œthat I disliked compliments--I now tell
you in earnest, that I do not ask sympathy, and that I despise
consolation. What I have borne, I have borne--What I am to bear I will
sustain as I may; no word of commiseration can make a burden feel one
featherâ€™s weight lighter to the slave who must carry it. There is only
one human being who could have assisted me, and that is he who has rather
chosen to add to my embarrassment--Rashleigh Osbaldistone.--Yes! the time
once was that I might have learned to love that man--But, great God! the
purpose for which he insinuated himself into the confidence of one
already so forlorn--the undeviating and continued assiduity with which he
pursued that purpose from year to year, without one single momentary
pause of remorse or compassion--the purpose for which he would have
converted into poison the food he administered to my mind--Gracious
Providence! what should I have been in this world, and the next, in body
and soul, had I fallen under the arts of this accomplished villain!â€

I was so much struck with the scene of perfidious treachery which these
words disclosed, that I rose from my chair hardly knowing what I did,
laid my hand on the hilt of my sword, and was about to leave the
apartment in search of him on whom I might discharge my just indignation.
Almost breathless, and with eyes and looks in which scorn and indignation
had given way to the most lively alarm, Miss Vernon threw herself between
me and the door of the apartment.

â€œStay!â€ she said--â€œstay!--however just your resentment, you do not know
half the secrets of this fearful prison-house.â€ She then glanced her eyes
anxiously round the room, and sunk her voice almost to a whisper--â€œHe
bears a charmed life; you cannot assail him without endangering other
lives, and wider destruction. Had it been otherwise, in some hour of
justice he had hardly been safe, even from this weak hand. I told you,â€
 she said, motioning me back to my seat, â€œthat I needed no comforter. I
now tell you I need no avenger.â€

I resumed my seat mechanically, musing on what she said, and recollecting
also, what had escaped me in my first glow of resentment, that I had no
title whatever to constitute myself Miss Vernonâ€™s champion. She paused to
let her own emotions and mine subside, and then addressed me with more
composure.

â€œI have already said that there is a mystery connected with Rashleigh, of
a dangerous and fatal nature. Villain as he is, and as he knows he stands
convicted in my eyes, I cannot--dare not, openly break with or defy him.
You also, Mr. Osbaldistone, must bear with him with patience, foil his
artifices by opposing to them prudence, not violence; and, above all, you
must avoid such scenes as that of last night, which cannot but give him
perilous advantages over you. This caution I designed to give you, and it
was the object with which I desired this interview; but I have extended
my confidence farther than I proposed.â€

I assured her it was not misplaced.

â€œI do not believe that it is,â€ she replied. â€œYou have that in your face
and manners which authorises trust. Let us continue to be friends. You
need not fear,â€ she said, laughing, while she blushed a little, yet
speaking with a free and unembarrassed voice, â€œthat friendship with us
should prove only a specious name, as the poet says, for another feeling.
I belong, in habits of thinking and acting, rather to your sex, with
which I have always been brought up, than to my own. Besides, the fatal
veil was wrapt round me in my cradle; for you may easily believe I have
never thought of the detestable condition under which I may remove it.
The time,â€ she added, â€œfor expressing my final determination is not
arrived, and I would fain have the freedom of wild heath and open air
with the other commoners of nature, as long as I can be permitted to
enjoy them. And now that the passage in Dante is made so clear, pray go
and see what has become of the badger-baiters. My head aches so much that
I cannot join the party.â€

I left the library, but not to join the hunters. I felt that a solitary
walk was necessary to compose my spirits before I again trusted myself in
Rashleighâ€™s company, whose depth of calculating villany had been so
strikingly exposed to me. In Dubourgâ€™s family (as he was of the reformed
persuasion) I had heard many a tale of Romish priests who gratified, at
the expense of friendship, hospitality, and the most sacred ties of
social life, those passions, the blameless indulgence of which is denied
by the rules of their order. But the deliberate system of undertaking the
education of a deserted orphan of noble birth, and so intimately allied
to his own family, with the perfidious purpose of ultimately seducing
her, detailed as it was by the intended victim with all the glow of
virtuous resentment, seemed more atrocious to me than the worst of the
tales I had heard at Bourdeaux, and I felt it would be extremely
difficult for me to meet Rashleigh, and yet to suppress the abhorrence
with which he impressed me. Yet this was absolutely necessary, not only
on account of the mysterious charge which Diana had given me, but because
I had, in reality, no ostensible ground for quarrelling with him.

I therefore resolved, as far as possible, to meet Rashleighâ€™s
dissimulation with equal caution on my part during our residence in the
same family; and when he should depart for London, I resolved to give
Owen at least such a hint of his character as might keep him on his guard
over my fatherâ€™s interests. Avarice or ambition, I thought, might have as
great, or greater charms, for a mind constituted like Rashleighâ€™s, than
unlawful pleasure; the energy of his character, and his power of assuming
all seeming good qualities, were likely to procure him a high degree of
confidence, and it was not to be hoped that either good faith or
gratitude would prevent him from abusing it. The task was somewhat
difficult, especially in my circumstances, since the caution which I
threw out might be imputed to jealousy of my rival, or rather my
successor, in my fatherâ€™s favour. Yet I thought it absolutely necessary
to frame such a letter, leaving it to Owen, who, in his own line, was
wary, prudent, and circumspect, to make the necessary use of his
knowledge of Rashleighâ€™s true character. Such a letter, therefore, I
indited, and despatched to the post-house by the first opportunity.

At my meeting with Rashleigh, he, as well as I, appeared to have taken up
distant ground, and to be disposed to avoid all pretext for collision. He
was probably conscious that Miss Vernonâ€™s communications had been
unfavourable to him, though he could not know that they extended to
discovering his meditated villany towards her. Our intercourse,
therefore, was reserved on both sides, and turned on subjects of little
interest. Indeed, his stay at Osbaldistone Hall did not exceed a few days
after this period, during which I only remarked two circumstances
respecting him. The first was the rapid and almost intuitive manner in
which his powerful and active mind seized upon and arranged the
elementary principles necessary to his new profession, which he now
studied hard, and occasionally made parade of his progress, as if to show
me how light it was for him to lift the burden which I had flung down
from very weariness and inability to carry it. The other remarkable
circumstance was, that, notwithstanding the injuries with which Miss
Vernon charged Rashleigh, they had several private interviews together of
considerable length, although their bearing towards each other in public
did not seem more cordial than usual.

When the day of Rashleighâ€™s departure arrived, his father bade him
farewell with indifference; his brothers with the ill-concealed glee of
school-boys who see their task-master depart for a season, and feel a joy
which they dare not express; and I myself with cold politeness. When he
approached Miss Vernon, and would have saluted her she drew back with a
look of haughty disdain; but said, as she extended her hand to him,
â€œFarewell, Rashleigh; God reward you for the good you have done, and
forgive you for the evil you have meditated.â€

â€œAmen, my fair cousin,â€ he replied, with an air of sanctity, which
belonged, I thought, to the seminary of Saint Omers; â€œhappy is he whose
good intentions have borne fruit in deeds, and whose evil thoughts have
perished in the blossom.â€

These were his parting words. â€œAccomplished hypocrite!â€ said Miss Vernon
to me, as the door closed behind him--â€œhow nearly can what we most
despise and hate, approach in outward manner to that which we most
venerate!â€

I had written to my father by Rashleigh, and also a few lines to Owen,
besides the confidential letter which I have already mentioned, and which
I thought it more proper and prudent to despatch by another conveyance.
In these epistles, it would have been natural for me to have pointed out
to my father and my friend, that I was at present in a situation where I
could improve myself in no respect, unless in the mysteries of hunting
and hawking; and where I was not unlikely to forget, in the company of
rude grooms and horse-boys, any useful knowledge or elegant
accomplishments which I had hitherto acquired. It would also have been
natural that I should have expressed the disgust and tedium which I was
likely to feel among beings whose whole souls were centred in
field-sports or more degrading pastimes--that I should have complained of
the habitual intemperance of the family in which I was a guest, and the
difficulty and almost resentment with which my uncle, Sir Hildebrand,
received any apology for deserting the bottle. This last, indeed, was a
topic on which my father, himself a man of severe temperance, was likely
to be easily alarmed, and to have touched upon this spring would to a
certainty have opened the doors of my prison-house, and would either have
been the means of abridging my exile, or at least would have procured me
a change of residence during my rustication.

I say, my dear Tresham, that, considering how very unpleasant a prolonged
residence at Osbaldistone Hall must have been to a young man of my age,
and with my habits, it might have seemed very natural that I should have
pointed out all these disadvantages to my father, in order to obtain his
consent for leaving my uncleâ€™s mansion. Nothing, however, is more
certain, than that I did not say a single word to this purpose in my
letters to my father and Owen. If Osbaldistone Hall had been Athens in
all its pristine glory of learning, and inhabited by sages, heroes, and
poets, I could not have expressed less inclination to leave it.

If thou hast any of the salt of youth left in thee, Tresham, thou wilt be
at no loss to account for my silence on a topic seemingly so obvious.
Miss Vernonâ€™s extreme beauty, of which she herself seemed so little
conscious--her romantic and mysterious situation--the evils to which she
was exposed--the courage with which she seemed to face them--her manners,
more frank than belonged to her sex, yet, as it seemed to me,
exceeding in frankness only from the dauntless consciousness of her
innocence,--above all, the obvious and flattering distinction which she
made in my favour over all other persons, were at once calculated to
interest my best feelings, to excite my curiosity, awaken my
imagination, and gratify my vanity. I dared not, indeed, confess to
myself the depth of the interest with which Miss Vernon inspired me, or
the large share which she occupied in my thoughts. We read together,
walked together, rode together, and sate together. The studies which she
had broken off upon her quarrel with Rashleigh, she now resumed, under
the auspices of a tutor whose views were more sincere, though his
capacity was far more limited.

In truth, I was by no means qualified to assist her in the prosecution of
several profound studies which she had commenced with Rashleigh, and
which appeared to me more fitted for a churchman than for a beautiful
female. Neither can I conceive with what view he should have engaged
Diana in the gloomy maze of casuistry which schoolmen called philosophy,
or in the equally abstruse though more certain sciences of mathematics
and astronomy; unless it were to break down and confound in her mind the
difference and distinction between the sexes, and to habituate her to
trains of subtle reasoning, by which he might at his own time invest that
which is wrong with the colour of that which is right. It was in the same
spirit, though in the latter case the evil purpose was more obvious, that
the lessons of Rashleigh had encouraged Miss Vernon in setting at nought
and despising the forms and ceremonial limits which are drawn round
females in modern society. It is true, she was sequestrated from all
female company, and could not learn the usual rules of decorum, either
from example or precept; yet such was her innate modesty, and accurate
sense of what was right and wrong, that she would not of herself have
adopted the bold uncompromising manner which struck me with so much
surprise on our first acquaintance, had she not been led to conceive that
a contempt of ceremony indicated at once superiority of understanding and
the confidence of conscious innocence. Her wily instructor had, no doubt,
his own views in levelling those outworks which reserve and caution erect
around virtue. But for these, and for his other crimes, he has long since
answered at a higher tribunal.

Besides the progress which Miss Vernon, whose powerful mind readily
adopted every means of information offered to it, had made in more
abstract science, I found her no contemptible linguist, and well
acquainted both with ancient and modern literature. Were it not that
strong talents will often go farthest when they seem to have least
assistance, it would be almost incredible to tell the rapidity of Miss
Vernonâ€™s progress in knowledge; and it was still more extraordinary, when
her stock of mental acquisitions from books was compared with her total
ignorance of actual life. It seemed as if she saw and knew everything,
except what passed in the world around her;--and I believe it was this
very ignorance and simplicity of thinking upon ordinary subjects, so
strikingly contrasted with her fund of general knowledge and information,
which rendered her conversation so irresistibly fascinating, and rivetted
the attention to whatever she said or did; since it was absolutely
impossible to anticipate whether her next word or action was to display
the most acute perception, or the most profound simplicity. The degree of
danger which necessarily attended a youth of my age and keen feelings
from remaining in close and constant intimacy with an object so amiable,
and so peculiarly interesting, all who remember their own sentiments at
my age may easily estimate.





CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.


                 Yon lamp its line of quivering light
                      Shoots from my ladyâ€™s bower;
                 But why should Beautyâ€™s lamp be bright
                      At midnightâ€™s lonely hour?
                                          OLD BALLAD.

The mode of life at Osbaldistone Hall was too uniform to admit of
description. Diana Vernon and I enjoyed much of our time in our mutual
studies; the rest of the family killed theirs in such sports and pastimes
as suited the seasons, in which we also took a share. My uncle was a man
of habits, and by habit became so much accustomed to my presence and mode
of life, that, upon the whole, he was rather fond of me than otherwise. I
might probably have risen yet higher in his good graces, had I employed
the same arts for that purpose which were used by Rashleigh, who,
availing himself of his fatherâ€™s disinclination to business, had
gradually insinuated himself into the management of his property. But
although I readily gave my uncle the advantage of my pen and my
arithmetic so often as he desired to correspond with a neighbour, or
settle with a tenant, and was, in so far, a more useful inmate in his
family than any of his sons, yet I was not willing to oblige Sir
Hildebrand by relieving him entirely from the management of his own
affairs; so that, while the good knight admitted that nevoy Frank was a
steady, handy lad, he seldom failed to remark in the same breath, that he
did not think he should haâ€™ missed Rashleigh so much as he was like to
do.

As it is particularly unpleasant to reside in a family where we are at
variance with any part of it, I made some efforts to overcome the
ill-will which my cousins entertained against me. I exchanged my laced
hat for a jockey-cap, and made some progress in their opinion; I broke a
young colt in a manner which carried me further into their good graces. A
bet or two opportunely lost to Dickon, and an extra health pledged with
Percie, placed me on an easy and familiar footing with all the young
squires, except Thorncliff.

I have already noticed the dislike entertained against me by this young
fellow, who, as he had rather more sense, had also a much worse temper,
than any of his brethren. Sullen, dogged, and quarrelsome, he regarded my
residence at Osbaldistone Hall as an intrusion, and viewed with envious
and jealous eyes my intimacy with Diana Vernon, whom the effect proposed
to be given to a certain family-compact assigned to him as an intended
spouse. That he loved her, could scarcely be said, at least without much
misapplication of the word; but he regarded her as something appropriated
to himself, and resented internally the interference which he knew not
how to prevent or interrupt. I attempted a tone of conciliation towards
Thorncliff on several occasions; but he rejected my advances with a
manner about as gracious as that of a growling mastiff, when the animal
shuns and resents a strangerâ€™s attempts to caress him. I therefore
abandoned him to his ill-humour, and gave myself no further trouble about
the matter.

Such was the footing upon which I stood with the family at Osbaldistone
Hall; but I ought to mention another of its inmates with whom I
occasionally held some discourse. This was Andrew Fairservice, the
gardener who (since he had discovered that I was a Protestant) rarely
suffered me to pass him without proffering his Scotch mull for a social
pinch. There were several advantages attending this courtesy. In the
first place, it was made at no expense, for I never took snuff; and
secondly, it afforded an excellent apology to Andrew (who was not
particularly fond of hard labour) for laying aside his spade for several
minutes. But, above all, these brief interviews gave Andrew an
opportunity of venting the news he had collected, or the satirical
remarks which his shrewd northern humour suggested.

â€œI am saying, sir,â€ he said to me one evening, with a face obviously
charged with intelligence, â€œI hae been down at the Trinlay-knowe.â€

â€œWell, Andrew, and I suppose you heard some news at the alehouse?â€

â€œNa, sir; I never gang to the yillhouse--that is unless ony neighbour was
to gie me a pint, or the like oâ€™ that; but to gang there on aneâ€™s ain
coat-tail, is a waste oâ€™ precious time and hard-won siller.--But I was
doun at the Trinlay-knowe, as I was saying, about a wee bit business oâ€™
my ain wiâ€™ Mattie Simpson, that wants a forpit or twa oâ€™ peers that will
never be missed in the Haâ€™-house--and when we were at the thrangest oâ€™
our bargain, wha suld come in but Pate Macready the travelling merchant?â€

â€œPedlar, I suppose you mean?â€

â€œEâ€™en as your honour likes to caâ€™ him; but itâ€™s a creditable calling and
a gainfuâ€™, and has been lang in use wiâ€™ our folk. Pateâ€™s a far-awa cousin
oâ€™ mine, and we were blythe to meet wiâ€™ ane anither.â€

â€œAnd you went and had a jug of ale together, I suppose, Andrew?--For
Heavenâ€™s sake, cut short your story.â€

â€œBide a wee--bide a wee; you southrons are aye in sic a hurry, and
this is something concerns yourself, an ye wad tak patience to
hearâ€™t--Yill?--deil a drap oâ€™ yill did Pate offer me; but Mattie gae us
baith a drap skimmed milk, and ane oâ€™ her thick ait jannocks, that was
as wat and raw as a divot. O for the bonnie girdle cakes oâ€™ the
north!--and sae we sat doun and took out our clavers.â€

â€œI wish you would take them out just now. Pray, tell me the news, if you
have got any worth telling, for I canâ€™t stop here all night.â€

â€œThan, if ye maun haeâ€™t, the folk in Lunnun are aâ€™ clean wud about this
bit job in the north here.â€

â€œClean wood! whatâ€™s that?â€

â€œOu, just real daft--neither to haud nor to bind--aâ€™ hirdy-girdy--clean
through ither--the deilâ€™s ower Jock Wabster.â€

â€œBut what does all this mean? or what business have I with the devil or
Jack Webster?â€

â€œUmph!â€ said Andrew, looking extremely knowing, â€œitâ€™s just because--just
that the dirdumâ€™s aâ€™ about yon manâ€™s pokmanty.â€

â€œWhose portmanteau? or what do you mean?â€

â€œOu, just the man Morrisâ€™s, that he said he lost yonder: but if itâ€™s no
your honourâ€™s affair, as little is it mine; and I mauna lose this
gracious evening.â€

And, as if suddenly seized with a violent fit of industry, Andrew began
to labour most diligently.

My attention, as the crafty knave had foreseen, was now arrested, and
unwilling, at the same time, to acknowledge any particular interest in
that affair, by asking direct questions, I stood waiting till the spirit
of voluntary communication should again prompt him to resume his story.
Andrew dug on manfully, and spoke at intervals, but nothing to the
purpose of Mr. Macreadyâ€™s news; and I stood and listened, cursing him in
my heart, and desirous at the same time to see how long his humour of
contradiction would prevail over his desire of speaking upon the subject
which was obviously uppermost in his mind.

â€œAm trenching up the sparry-grass, and am gaun to saw some Misegun beans;
they winna want them to their swineâ€™s flesh, Iâ€™se warrant--muckle gude
may it do them. And siclike dung as the grieve has gien me!--it should be
wheat-strae, or aiten at the warst oâ€™t, and itâ€™s pease dirt, as
fizzenless as chuckie-stanes. But the huntsman guides aâ€™ as he likes
about the stable-yard, and heâ€™s selled the best oâ€™ the litter, Iâ€™se
warrant. But, howsoever, we mauna lose a turn oâ€™ this Saturday at eâ€™en,
for the watherâ€™s sair broken, and if thereâ€™s a fair day in seven,
Sundayâ€™s sure to come and lick it up--Howsomever, Iâ€™m no denying that it
may settle, if it be Heavenâ€™s will, till Monday morning,--and whatâ€™s the
use oâ€™ my breaking my back at this rate?--I think, Iâ€™ll eâ€™en awaâ€™ hame,
for yonâ€™s the curfew, as they caâ€™ their jowing-in bell.â€

Accordingly, applying both his hands to his spade, he pitched it upright
in the trench which he had been digging and, looking at me with the air
of superiority of one who knows himself possessed of important
information, which he may communicate or refuse at his pleasure, pulled
down the sleeves of his shirt, and walked slowly towards his coat, which
lay carefully folded up upon a neighbouring garden-seat.

â€œI must pay the penalty of having interrupted the tiresome rascal,â€
 thought I to myself, â€œand even gratify Mr. Fairservice by taking his
communication on his own terms.â€ Then raising my voice, I addressed
him,--â€œAnd after all, Andrew, what are these London news you had from your
kinsman, the travelling merchant?â€

â€œThe pedlar, your honour means?â€ retorted Andrew--â€œbut caâ€™ him what ye
wull, theyâ€™re a great convenience in a country-side thatâ€™s scant oâ€™
borough-towns like this Northumberland--Thatâ€™s no the case, now, in
Scotland;--thereâ€™s the kingdom of Fife, frae Culross to the East Nuik,
itâ€™s just like a great combined city--sae mony royal boroughs yoked on
end to end, like ropes of ingans, with their hie-streets and their
booths, nae doubt, and their kraemes, and houses of stane and lime and
fore-stairs--Kirkcaldy, the sell oâ€™t, is langer than ony town in
England.â€

â€œI daresay it is all very splendid and very fine--but you were talking of
the London news a little while ago, Andrew.â€

â€œAy,â€ replied Andrew; â€œbut I dinna think your honour cared to hear about
them--Howsoeverâ€ (he continued, grinning a ghastly smile), â€œPate Macready
does say, that they are sair mistrysted yonder in their Parliament House
about this rubbery oâ€™ Mr. Morris, or whatever they caâ€™ the chiel.â€

â€œIn the House of Parliament, Andrew!--how came they to mention it there?â€

â€œOu, thatâ€™s just what I said to Pate; if it like your honour, Iâ€™ll tell
you the very words; itâ€™s no worth making a lie for the matter--â€˜Pate,â€™
said I, â€˜what ado had the lords and lairds and gentles at Lunnun wiâ€™ the
carle and his walise?--When we had a Scotch Parliament, Pate,â€™ says I
(and deil rax their thrapples that reft us oâ€™t!) â€˜they sate dousely down
and made laws for a haill country and kinrick, and never fashed their
beards about things that were competent to the judge ordinar oâ€™ the
bounds; but I think,â€™ said I, â€˜that if ae kailwife pouâ€™d aff her
neighbourâ€™s mutch they wad hae the twasome oâ€™ them into the Parliament
House oâ€™ Lunnun. Itâ€™s just,â€™ said I, â€˜amaist as silly as our auld daft
laird here and his gomerils oâ€™ sons, wiâ€™ his huntsmen and his hounds, and
his hunting cattle and horns, riding haill days after a bit beast that
winna weigh sax punds when they hae catched it.â€™â€

â€œYou argued most admirably, Andrew,â€ said I, willing to encourage him to
get into the marrow of his intelligence; â€œand what said Pate?â€

â€œOu,â€ he said, â€œwhat better could be expected of a wheen pock-pudding
English folk?--But as to the robbery, itâ€™s like that when theyâ€™re aâ€™ at
the thrang oâ€™ their Whig and Tory wark, and caâ€™ing ane anither, like
unhanged blackguards--up gets ae lang-tongued chield, and he says, that
aâ€™ the north of England were rank Jacobites (and, quietly, he wasna far
wrang maybe), and that they had levied amaist open war, and a kingâ€™s
messenger had been stoppit and rubbit on the highway, and that the best
bluid oâ€™ Northumberland had been at the doing oâ€™t--and mickle gowd taâ€™en
aff him, and mony valuable papers; and that there was nae redress to be
gotten by remeed of law for the first justice oâ€™ the peace that the
rubbit man gaed to, he had fund the twa loons that did the deed birling
and drinking wiâ€™ him, wha but they; and the justice took the word oâ€™ the
tane for the compearance oâ€™ the tither; and that they eâ€™en gae him
leg-bail, and the honest man that had lost his siller was fain to leave
the country for fear that waur had come of it.â€

â€œCan this be really true?â€ said I.

â€œPate swears itâ€™s as true as that his ellwand is a yard lang--(and so it
is, just bating an inch, that it may meet the English measure)--And when
the chield had said his warst, there was a terrible cry for names, and
out comes he wiâ€™ this man Morrisâ€™s name, and your uncleâ€™s, and Squire
Inglewoodâ€™s, and other folkâ€™s besideâ€ (looking sly at me)--â€œAnd then
another dragon oâ€™ a chield got up on the other side, and said, wad they
accuse the best gentleman in the land on the oath of a broken
coward?--for itâ€™s like that Morris had been drummed out oâ€™ the army for
rinning awa in Flanders; and he said, it was like the story had been
made up between the minister and him or ever he had left Lunnun; and
that, if there was to be a search-warrant granted, he thought the siller
wad be fund some gate near to St. Jamesâ€™s Palace. Aweel, they trailed up
Morris to their bar, as they caâ€™t, to see what he could say to the job;
but the folk that were again him, gae him sic an awfuâ€™ throughgaun about
his rinninâ€™ awa, and about aâ€™ the ill he had ever dune or said for aâ€™
the forepart oâ€™ his life, that Patie says he looked mair like ane dead
than living; and they couâ€™dna get a word oâ€™ sense out oâ€™ him, for
downright fright at their growling and routing. He maun be a saft sap,
wiâ€™ a head nae better than a fozy frosted turnip--it wad hae taâ€™en a
hantle oâ€™ them to scaur Andrew Fairservice out oâ€™ his tale.â€

â€œAnd how did it all end, Andrew? did your friend happen to learn?â€

â€œOu, ay; for as his walk is in this country, Pate put aff his journey for
the space of a week or thereby, because it wad be acceptable to his
customers to bring down the news. Itâ€™s just aâ€™ gaed aft like moonshine in
water. The fallow that began it drew in his horns, and said, that though
he believed the man had been rubbit, yet he acknowledged he might hae
been mistaâ€™en about the particulars. And then the other chield got up,
and said, he caredna whether Morris was rubbed or no, provided it wasna
to become a stain on ony gentlemanâ€™s honour and reputation, especially in
the north of England; for, said he before them, I come frae the north
mysell, and I carena a boddle wha kens it. And this is what they caâ€™
explaining--the tane gies up a bit, and the tither gies up a bit, and aâ€™
friends again. Aweel, after the Commonsâ€™ Parliament had tuggit, and
rived, and rugged at Morris and his rubbery till they were tired oâ€™t, the
Lordsâ€™ Parliament they behoved to hae their spell oâ€™t. In puir auld
Scotlandâ€™s Parliament they aâ€™ sate thegither, cheek by choul, and than
they didna need to hae the same blethers twice ower again. But tillâ€™t
their lordships went wiâ€™ as muckle teeth and gude-will, as if the matter
had been aâ€™ speck and span new. Forbye, there was something said about
ane Campbell, that suld hae been concerned in the rubbery, mair or less,
and that he suld hae had a warrant frae the Duke of Argyle, as a
testimonial oâ€™ his character. And this put MacCallum Moreâ€™s beard in a
bleize, as gude reason there was; and he gat up wiâ€™ an unco bang, and
garrâ€™d them aâ€™ look about them, and wad ram it even doun their throats,
there was never ane oâ€™ the Campbells but was as wight, wise, warlike, and
worthy trust, as auld Sir John the Graeme. Now, if your honourâ€™s sure ye
arena a drapâ€™s bluid a-kin to a Campbell, as I am nane mysell, sae far as
I can count my kin, or hae had it counted to me, Iâ€™ll gie ye my mind on
that matter.â€

â€œYou may be assured I have no connection whatever with any gentleman of
the name.â€

â€œOu, than we may speak it quietly amang oursells. Thereâ€™s baith gude and
bad oâ€™ the Campbells, like other names, But this MacCallum More has an
unco sway and say baith, amang the grit folk at Lunnun even now; for he
canna preceesely be said to belang to ony oâ€™ the twa sides oâ€™ them, sae
deil any oâ€™ them likes to quarrel wiâ€™ him; sae they eâ€™en voted Morrisâ€™s
tale a fause calumnious libel, as they caâ€™t, and if he hadna gien them
leg-bail, he was likely to hae taâ€™en the air on the pillory for
leasing-making.â€

So speaking, honest Andrew collected his dibbles, spades, and hoes, and
threw them into a wheel-barrow,--leisurely, however, and allowing me full
time to put any further questions which might occur to me before he
trundled them off to the tool-house, there to repose during the ensuing
day. I thought it best to speak out at once, lest this meddling fellow
should suppose there were more weighty reasons for my silence than
actually existed.

â€œI should like to see this countryman of yours, Andrew and to hear his
news from himself directly. You have probably heard that I had some
trouble from the impertinent folly of this man Morrisâ€ (Andrew grinned a
most significant grin), â€œand I should wish to see your cousin the
merchant, to ask him the particulars of what he heard in London, if it
could be done without much trouble.â€

â€œNaething mair easy,â€ Andrew observed; â€œhe had but to hint to his cousin
that I wanted a pair or twa oâ€™ hose, and he wad be wiâ€™ me as fast as he
could lay leg to the grund.â€

â€œO yes, assure him I shall be a customer; and as the night is, as you
say, settled and fair, I shall walk in the garden until he comes; the
moon will soon rise over the fells. You may bring him to the little
back-gate; and I shall have pleasure, in the meanwhile, in looking on the
bushes and evergreens by the bright frosty moonlight.â€

â€œVara right, vara right--thatâ€™s what I hae aften said; a kail-blade, or a
colliflour, glances sae glegly by moonlight, itâ€™s like a leddy in her
diamonds.â€

So saying, off went Andrew Fairservice with great glee. He had to walk
about two miles, a labour he undertook with the greatest pleasure, in
order to secure to his kinsman the sale of some articles of his trade,
though it is probable he would not have given him sixpence to treat him
to a quart of ale. â€œThe good will of an Englishman would have displayed
itself in a manner exactly the reverse of Andrewâ€™s,â€ thought I, as I
paced along the smooth-cut velvet walks, which, embowered with high,
hedges of yew and of holly, intersected the ancient garden of
Osbaldistone Hall.

As I turned to retrace my steps, it was natural that I should lift up my
eyes to the windows of the old library; which, small in size, but several
in number, stretched along the second story of that side of the house
which now faced me. Light glanced from their casements. I was not
surprised at this, for I knew Miss Vernon often sat there of an evening,
though from motives of delicacy I put a strong restraint upon myself, and
never sought to join her at a time when I knew, all the rest of the
family being engaged for the evening, our interviews must necessarily
have been strictly _tete-aâ€™-tete._ In the mornings we usually read
together in the same room; but then it often happened that one or other
of our cousins entered to seek some parchment duodecimo that could be
converted into a fishing-book, despite its gildings and illumination, or
to tell us of some â€œsport toward,â€ or from mere want of knowing where
else to dispose of themselves. In short, in the mornings the library was
a sort of public room, where man and woman might meet as on neutral
ground. In the evening it was very different and bred in a country where
much attention is paid, or was at least then paid, to _bienseâ€™ance,_ I
was desirous to think for Miss Vernon concerning those points of
propriety where her experience did not afford her the means of thinking
for herself. I made her therefore comprehend, as delicately as I could,
that when we had evening lessons, the presence of a third party was
proper.

Miss Vernon first laughed, then blushed, and was disposed to be
displeased; and then, suddenly checking herself, said, â€œI believe you are
very right; and when I feel inclined to be a very busy scholar, I will
bribe old Martha with a cup of tea to sit by me and be my screen.â€

Martha, the old housekeeper, partook of the taste of the family at the
Hall. A toast and tankard would have pleased her better than all the tea
in China. However, as the use of this beverage was then confined to the
higher ranks, Martha felt some vanity in being asked to partake of it;
and by dint of a great deal of sugar, many words scarce less sweet, and
abundance of toast and butter, she was sometimes prevailed upon to give
us her countenance. On other occasions, the servants almost unanimously
shunned the library after nightfall, because it was their foolish
pleasure to believe that it lay on the haunted side of the house. The
more timorous had seen sights and heard sounds there when all the rest of
the house was quiet; and even the young squires were far from having any
wish to enter these formidable precincts after nightfall without
necessity.

That the library had at one time been a favourite resource of
Rashleigh--that a private door out of one side of it communicated with
the sequestered and remote apartment which he chose for himself, rather
increased than disarmed the terrors which the household had for the
dreaded library of Osbaldistone Hall. His extensive information as to
what passed in the world--his profound knowledge of science of every
kind--a few physical experiments which he occasionally showed off, were,
in a house of so much ignorance and bigotry, esteemed good reasons for
supposing him endowed with powers over the spiritual world. He understood
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew; and, therefore, according to the apprehension,
and in the phrase of his brother Wilfred, needed not to care â€œfor ghaist
or bar-ghaist, devil or dobbie.â€ Yea, the servants persisted that they
had heard him hold conversations in the library, when every varsal soul
in the family were gone to bed; and that he spent the night in watching
for bogles, and the morning in sleeping in his bed, when he should have
been heading the hounds like a true Osbaldistone.

All these absurd rumours I had heard in broken hints and imperfect
sentences, from which I was left to draw the inference; and, as easily
may be supposed, I laughed them to scorn. But the extreme solitude to
which this chamber of evil fame was committed every night after curfew
time, was an additional reason why I should not intrude on Miss Vernon
when she chose to sit there in the evening.

To resume what I was saying,--I was not surprised to see a glimmering of
light from the library windows: but I was a little struck when I
distinctly perceived the shadows of two persons pass along and intercept
the light from the first of the windows, throwing the casement for a
moment into shade. â€œIt must be old Martha,â€ thought I, â€œwhom Diana has
engaged to be her companion for the evening; or I must have been
mistaken, and taken Dianaâ€™s shadow for a second person. No, by Heaven! it
appears on the second window,--two figures distinctly traced; and now it
is lost again--it is seen on the third--on the fourth--the darkened forms
of two persons distinctly seen in each window as they pass along the
room, betwixt the windows and the lights. Whom can Diana have got for a
companion?â€--The passage of the shadows between the lights and the
casements was twice repeated, as if to satisfy me that my observation
served me truly; after which the lights were extinguished, and the
shades, of course, were seen no more.

Trifling as this circumstance was, it occupied my mind for a considerable
time. I did not allow myself to suppose that my friendship for Miss
Vernon had any directly selfish view; yet it is incredible the
displeasure I felt at the idea of her admitting any one to private
interviews, at a time, and in a place, where, for her own sake, I had
been at some trouble to show her that it was improper for me to meet with
her.

â€œSilly, romping, incorrigible girl!â€ said I to myself, â€œon whom all good
advice and delicacy are thrown away! I have been cheated by the
simplicity of her manner, which I suppose she can assume just as she
could a straw bonnet, were it the fashion, for the mere sake of
celebrity. I suppose, notwithstanding the excellence of her
understanding, the society of half a dozen of clowns to play at whisk and
swabbers would give her more pleasure than if Ariosto himself were to
awake from the dead.â€

This reflection came the more powerfully across my mind, because, having
mustered up courage to show to Diana my version of the first books of
Ariosto, I had requested her to invite Martha to a tea-party in the
library that evening, to which arrangement Miss Vernon had refused her
consent, alleging some apology which I thought frivolous at the time. I
had not long speculated on this disagreeable subject, when the
back garden-door opened, and the figures of Andrew and his
country-man--bending under his pack--crossed the moonlight alley,
and called my attention elsewhere.

I found Mr. Macready, as I expected, a tough, sagacious, long-headed
Scotchman, and a collector of news both from choice and profession. He
was able to give me a distinct account of what had passed in the House of
Commons and House of Lords on the affair of Morris, which, it appears,
had been made by both parties a touchstone to ascertain the temper of the
Parliament. It appeared also, that, as I had learned from Andrew, by
second hand, the ministry had proved too weak to support a story
involving the character of men of rank and importance, and resting upon
the credit of a person of such indifferent fame as Morris, who was,
moreover, confused and contradictory in his mode of telling the story.
Macready was even able to supply me with a copy of a printed journal, or
News-Letter, seldom extending beyond the capital, in which the substance
of the debate was mentioned; and with a copy of the Duke of Argyleâ€™s
speech, printed upon a broadside, of which he had purchased several from
the hawkers, because, he said, it would be a saleable article on the
north of the Tweed. The first was a meagre statement, full of blanks and
asterisks, and which added little or nothing to the information I had
from the Scotchman; and the Dukeâ€™s speech, though spirited and eloquent,
contained chiefly a panegyric on his country, his family, and his clan,
with a few compliments, equally sincere, perhaps, though less glowing,
which he took so favourable an opportunity of paying to himself. I could
not learn whether my own reputation had been directly implicated,
although I perceived that the honour of my uncleâ€™s family had been
impeached, and that this person Campbell, stated by Morris to have been
the most active robber of the two by whom he was assailed, was said by
him to have appeared in the behalf of a Mr. Osbaldistone, and by the
connivance of the Justice procured his liberation. In this particular,
Morrisâ€™s story jumped with my own suspicions, which had attached to
Campbell from the moment I saw him appear at Justice Inglewoodâ€™s. Vexed
upon the whole, as well as perplexed, with this extraordinary story, I
dismissed the two Scotchmen, after making some purchases from Macready,
and a small compliment to Fairservice, and retired to my own apartment to
consider what I ought to do in defence of my character thus publicly
attacked.





CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.

                       Whence, and what art you?
                                       Milton.

After exhausting a sleepless night in meditating on the intelligence I
had received, I was at first inclined to think that I ought, as speedily
as possible, to return to London, and by my open appearance repel the
calumny which had been spread against me. But I hesitated to take this
course on recollection of my fatherâ€™s disposition, singularly absolute in
his decisions as to all that concerned his family. He was most able,
certainly, from experience, to direct what I ought to do, and from his
acquaintance with the most distinguished Whigs then in power, had
influence enough to obtain a hearing for my cause. So, upon the whole, I
judged it most safe to state my whole story in the shape of a narrative,
addressed to my father; and as the ordinary opportunities of intercourse
between the Hall and the post-town recurred rarely, I determined to ride
to the town, which was about ten milesâ€™ distance, and deposit my letter
in the post-office with my own hands.

Indeed I began to think it strange that though several weeks had elapsed
since my departure from home, I had received no letter, either from my
father or Owen, although Rashleigh had written to Sir Hildebrand of his
safe arrival in London, and of the kind reception he had met with from
his uncle. Admitting that I might have been to blame, I did not deserve,
in my own opinion at least, to be so totally forgotten by my father; and
I thought my present excursion might have the effect of bringing a letter
from him to hand more early than it would otherwise have reached me. But
before concluding my letter concerning the affair of Morris, I failed not
to express my earnest hope and wish that my father would honour me with a
few lines, were it but to express his advice and commands in an affair of
some difficulty, and where my knowledge of life could not be supposed
adequate to my own guidance. I found it impossible to prevail on myself
to urge my actual return to London as a place of residence, and I
disguised my unwillingness to do so under apparent submission to my
fatherâ€™s will, which, as I imposed it on myself as a sufficient reason
for not urging my final departure from Osbaldistone Hall, would, I
doubted not, be received as such by my parent. But I begged permission to
come to London, for a short time at least, to meet and refute the
infamous calumnies which had been circulated concerning me in so public a
manner. Having made up my packet, in which my earnest desire to vindicate
my character was strangely blended with reluctance to quit my present
place of residence, I rode over to the post-town, and deposited my letter
in the office. By doing so, I obtained possession, somewhat earlier than
I should otherwise have done, of the following letter from my friend Mr.
Owen:--

â€œDear Mr. Francis,

â€œYours received per favour of Mr. R. Osbaldistone, and note the contents.
Shall do Mr. R. O. such civilities as are in my power, and have taken him
to see the Bank and Custom-house. He seems a sober, steady young
gentleman, and takes to business; so will be of service to the firm.
Could have wished another person had turned his mind that way; but Godâ€™s
will be done. As cash may be scarce in those parts, have to trust you
will excuse my enclosing a goldsmithâ€™s bill at six daysâ€™ sight, on
Messrs. Hooper and Girder of Newcastle, for L100, which I doubt not will
be duly honoured.--I remain, as in duty bound, dear Mr. Frank, your very
respectful and obedient servant,

â€œJoseph Owen.

â€œ_Postscriptum._--Hope you will advise the above coming safe to hand. Am
sorry we have so few of yours. Your father says he is as usual, but looks
poorly.â€


From this epistle, written in old Owenâ€™s formal style, I was rather
surprised to observe that he made no acknowledgment of that private
letter which I had written to him, with a view to possess him of
Rashleighâ€™s real character, although, from the course of post, it seemed
certain that he ought to have received it. Yet I had sent it by the usual
conveyance from the Hall, and had no reason to suspect that it could
miscarry upon the road. As it comprised matters of great importance both
to my father and to myself, I sat down in the post-office and again wrote
to Owen, recapitulating the heads of my former letter, and requesting to
know, in course of post, if it had reached him in safety. I also
acknowledged the receipt of the bill, and promised to make use of the
contents if I should have any occasion for money. I thought, indeed, it
was odd that my father should leave the care of supplying my necessities
to his clerk; but I concluded it was a matter arranged between them. At
any rate, Owen was a bachelor, rich in his way, and passionately attached
to me, so that I had no hesitation in being obliged to him for a small
sum, which I resolved to consider as a loan, to be returned with my
earliest ability, in case it was not previously repaid by my father; and
I expressed myself to this purpose to Mr. Owen. A shopkeeper in a little
town, to whom the post-master directed me, readily gave me in gold the
amount of my bill on Messrs. Hooper and Girder, so that I returned to
Osbaldistone Hall a good deal richer than I had set forth. This recruit
to my finances was not a matter of indifference to me, as I was
necessarily involved in some expenses at Osbaldistone Hall; and I had
seen, with some uneasy impatience, that the sum which my travelling
expenses had left unexhausted at my arrival there was imperceptibly
diminishing. This source of anxiety was for the present removed. On my
arrival at the Hall I found that Sir Hildebrand and all his offspring had
gone down to the little hamlet, called Trinlay-knowes, â€œto see,â€ as
Andrew Fairservice expressed it, â€œa wheen midden cocks pike ilk itherâ€™s
barns out.â€

â€œIt is indeed a brutal amusement, Andrew; I suppose you have none such in
Scotland?â€

â€œNa, na,â€ answered Andrew boldly; then shaded away his negative with,
â€œunless it be on Fasternâ€™s-eâ€™en, or the like oâ€™ that--But indeed itâ€™s no
muckle matter what the folk do to the midden pootry, for they had siccan
a skarting and scraping in the yard, that thereâ€™s nae getting a bean or
pea keepit for them.--But I am wondering what it is that leaves that
turret-door open;--now that Mr. Rashleighâ€™s away, it canna be him, I
trow.â€

The turret-door to which he alluded opened to the garden at the bottom of
a winding stair, leading down from Mr. Rashleighâ€™s apartment. This, as I
have already mentioned, was situated in a sequestered part of the house,
communicating with the library by a private entrance, and by another
intricate and dark vaulted passage with the rest of the house. A long
narrow turf walk led, between two high holly hedges, from the turret-door
to a little postern in the wall of the garden. By means of these
communications Rashleigh, whose movements were very independent of those
of the rest of his family, could leave the Hall or return to it at
pleasure, without his absence or presence attracting any observation. But
during his absence the stair and the turret-door were entirely disused,
and this made Andrewâ€™s observation somewhat remarkable.

â€œHave you often observed that door open?â€ was my question.

â€œNo just that often neither; but I hae noticed it ance or twice. Iâ€™m
thinking it maun hae been the priest, Father Vaughan, as they caâ€™ him.
Yeâ€™ll no catch ane oâ€™ the servants gauging up that stair, puir frightened
heathens that they are, for fear of bogles and brownies, and lang-nebbit
things frae the neist warld. But Father Vaughan thinks himself a
privileged person--set him up and lay him down!--Iâ€™se be caution the
warst stibbler that ever stickit a sermon out ower the Tweed yonder, wad
lay a ghaist twice as fast as him, wiâ€™ his holy water and his idolatrous
trinkets. I dinna believe he speaks gude Latin neither; at least he disna
take me up when I tell him the learned names oâ€™ the plants.â€

Of Father Vaughan, who divided his time and his ghostly care between
Osbaldistone Hall and about half a dozen mansions of Catholic gentlemen
in the neighbourhood, I have as yet said nothing, for I had seen but
little. He was aged about sixty--of a good family, as I was given to
understand, in the north--of a striking and imposing presence, grave in
his exterior, and much respected among the Catholics of Northumberland as
a worthy and upright man. Yet Father Vaughan did not altogether lack
those peculiarities which distinguish his order. There hung about him an
air of mystery, which, in Protestant eyes, savoured of priestcraft. The
natives (such they might be well termed) of Osbaldistone Hall looked up
to him with much more fear, or at least more awe, than affection. His
condemnation of their revels was evident, from their being discontinued
in some measure when the priest was a resident at the Hall. Even Sir
Hildebrand himself put some restraint upon his conduct at such times,
which, perhaps, rendered Father Vaughanâ€™s presence rather irksome than
otherwise. He had the well-bred, insinuating, and almost flattering
address peculiar to the clergy of his persuasion, especially in England,
where the lay Catholic, hemmed in by penal laws, and by the restrictions
of his sect and recommendation of his pastor, often exhibits a reserved,
and almost a timid manner in the society of Protestants; while the
priest, privileged by his order to mingle with persons of all creeds, is
open, alert, and liberal in his intercourse with them, desirous of
popularity, and usually skilful in the mode of obtaining it.

Father Vaughan was a particular acquaintance of Rashleighâ€™s, otherwise,
in all probability, he would scarce have been able to maintain his
footing at Osbaldistone Hall. This gave me no desire to cultivate his
intimacy, nor did he seem to make any advances towards mine; so our
occasional intercourse was confined to the exchange of mere civility. I
considered it as extremely probable that Mr. Vaughan might occupy
Rashleighâ€™s apartment during his occasional residence at the Hall; and
his profession rendered it likely that he should occasionally be a tenant
of the library. Nothing was more probable than that it might have been
his candle which had excited my attention on a preceding evening. This
led me involuntarily to recollect that the intercourse between Miss
Vernon and the priest was marked with something like the same mystery
which characterised her communications with Rashleigh. I had never heard
her mention Vaughanâ€™s name, or even allude to him, excepting on the
occasion of our first meeting, when she mentioned the old priest and
Rashleigh as the only conversable beings, besides herself, in
Osbaldistone Hall. Yet although silent with respect to Father Vaughan,
his arrival at the Hall never failed to impress Miss Vernon with an
anxious and fluttering tremor, which lasted until they had exchanged one
or two significant glances.

Whatever the mystery might be which overclouded the destinies of this
beautiful and interesting female, it was clear that Father Vaughan was
implicated in it; unless, indeed, I could suppose that he was the agent
employed to procure her settlement in the cloister, in the event of her
rejecting a union with either of my cousins,--an office which would
sufficiently account for her obvious emotion at his appearance. As to the
rest, they did not seem to converse much together, or even to seek each
otherâ€™s society. Their league, if any subsisted between them, was of a
tacit and understood nature, operating on their actions without any
necessity of speech. I recollected, however, on reflection, that I had
once or twice discovered signs pass betwixt them, which I had at the time
supposed to bear reference to some hint concerning Miss Vernonâ€™s
religious observances, knowing how artfully the Catholic clergy maintain,
at all times and seasons, their influence over the minds of their
followers. But now I was disposed to assign to these communications a
deeper and more mysterious import. Did he hold private meetings with Miss
Vernon in the library? was a question which occupied my thoughts; and if
so, for what purpose? And why should she have admitted an intimate of the
deceitful Rashleigh to such close confidence?

These questions and difficulties pressed on my mind with an interest
which was greatly increased by the impossibility of resolving them. I had
already begun to suspect that my friendship for Diana Vernon was not
altogether so disinterested as in wisdom it ought to have been. I had
already felt myself becoming jealous of the contemptible lout Thorncliff,
and taking more notice, than in prudence or dignity of feeling I ought to
have done, of his silly attempts to provoke me. And now I was
scrutinising the conduct of Miss Vernon with the most close and eager
observation, which I in vain endeavoured to palm on myself as the
offspring of idle curiosity. All these, like Benedickâ€™s brushing his hat
of a morning, were signs that the sweet youth was in love; and while my
judgment still denied that I had been guilty of forming an attachment so
imprudent, she resembled those ignorant guides, who, when they have led
the traveller and themselves into irretrievable error, persist in
obstinately affirming it to be impossible that they can have missed the
way.





CHAPTER SIXTEENTH.

     It happened one day about noon, going to my boat, I was exceedingly
     surprised with the print of a manâ€™s naked foot on the shore, which
     was very plain to be seen on the sand.
                                            Robinson Crusoe.

With the blended feelings of interest and jealousy which were engendered
by Miss Vernonâ€™s singular situation, my observations of her looks and
actions became acutely sharpened, and that to a degree which,
notwithstanding my efforts to conceal it, could not escape her
penetration. The sense that she was observed, or, more properly speaking,
that she was watched by my looks, seemed to give Diana a mixture of
embarrassment, pain, and pettishness. At times it seemed that she sought
an opportunity of resenting a conduct which she could not but feel as
offensive, considering the frankness with which she had mentioned the
difficulties that surrounded her. At other times she seemed prepared to
expostulate upon the subject. But either her courage failed, or some
other sentiment impeded her seeking an _eâ€™claircissement._ Her
displeasure evaporated in repartee, and her expostulations died on her
lips. We stood in a singular relation to each other,--spending, and by
mutual choice, much of our time in close society with each other, yet
disguising our mutual sentiments, and jealous of, or offended by, each
otherâ€™s actions. There was betwixt us intimacy without confidence;--on
one side, love without hope or purpose, and curiosity without any
rational or justifiable motive; and on the other, embarrassment and
doubt, occasionally mingled with displeasure. Yet I believe that this
agitation of the passions (such is the nature of the human bosom), as it
continued by a thousand irritating and interesting, though petty
circumstances, to render Miss Vernon and me the constant objects of each
otherâ€™s thoughts, tended, upon the whole, to increase the attachment with
which we were naturally disposed to regard each other. But although my
vanity early discovered that my presence at Osbaldistone Hall had given
Diana some additional reason for disliking the cloister, I could by no
means confide in an affection which seemed completely subordinate to the
mysteries of her singular situation. Miss Vernon was of a character far
too formed and determined, to permit her love for me to overpower either
her sense of duty or of prudence, and she gave me a proof of this in a
conversation which we had together about this period.

We were sitting together in the library. Miss Vernon, in turning over a
copy of the Orlando Furioso, which belonged to me, shook a piece of
writing paper from between the leaves. I hastened to lift it, but she
prevented me.--â€œIt is verse,â€ she said, on glancing at the paper; and
then unfolding it, but as if to wait my answer before proceeding--â€œMay I
take the liberty?--Nay, nay, if you blush and stammer, I must do violence
to your modesty, and suppose that permission is granted.â€

â€œIt is not worthy your perusal--a scrap of a translation--My dear Miss
Vernon, it would be too severe a trial, that you, who understand the
original so well, should sit in judgment.â€

â€œMine honest friend,â€ replied Diana, â€œdo not, if you will be guided by my
advice, bait your hook with too much humility; for, ten to one, it will
not catch a single compliment. You know I belong to the unpopular family
of Tell-truths, and would not flatter Apollo for his lyre.â€

She proceeded to read the first stanza, which was nearly to the following
purpose:--

            â€œLadies, and knights, and arms, and loveâ€™s fair flame,
                 Deeds of emprize and courtesy, I sing;
             What time the Moors from sultry Africk came,
                Led on by Agramant, their youthful king--
                He whom revenge and hasty ire did bring
             Oâ€™er the broad wave, in France to waste and war;
             Such ills from old Trojanoâ€™s death did spring,
                Which to avenge he came from realms afar,
             And menaced Christian Charles, the Roman Emperor.
             Of dauntless Roland, too, my strain shall sound,
                In import never known in prose or rhyme,
             How He, the chief, of judgment deemed profound,
                For luckless love was crazed upon a timeâ€--

â€œThere is a great deal of it,â€ said she, glancing along the paper, and
interrupting the sweetest sounds which mortal ears can drink in,--those
of a youthful poetâ€™s verses, namely, read by the lips which are dearest
to him.

â€œMuch more than ought to engage your attention, Miss Vernon,â€ I replied,
something mortified; and I took the verses from her unreluctant hand--
â€œAnd yet,â€ I continued, â€œshut up as I am in this retired situation, I
have felt sometimes I could not amuse myself better than by carrying
on--merely for my own amusement, you will of course understand--the
version of this fascinating author, which I began some months since when
I was on the banks of the Garonne.â€

â€œThe question would only be,â€ said Diana, gravely, â€œwhether you could not
spend your time to better purpose?â€

â€œYou mean in original composition?â€ said I, greatly flattered--â€œBut, to
say truth, my genius rather lies in finding words and rhymes than ideas;
and therefore I am happy to use those which Ariosto has prepared to my
hand. However, Miss Vernon, with the encouragement you giveâ€--

â€œPardon me, Frank--it is encouragement not of my giving, but of your
taking. I meant neither original composition nor translation, since I
think you might employ your time to far better purpose than in either.
You are mortified,â€ she continued, â€œand I am sorry to be the cause.â€

â€œNot mortified,--certainly not mortified,â€ said I, with the best grace I
could muster, and it was but indifferently assumed; â€œI am too much
obliged by the interest you take in me.â€

â€œNay, but,â€ resumed the relentless Diana, â€œthere is both mortification
and a little grain of anger in that constrained tone of voice; do not be
angry if I probe your feelings to the bottom--perhaps what I am about to
say will affect them still more.â€

I felt the childishness of my own conduct, and the superior manliness of
Miss Vernonâ€™s, and assured her, that she need not fear my wincing under
criticism which I knew to be kindly meant.

â€œThat was honestly meant and said,â€ she replied; â€œI knew full well that
the fiend of poetical irritability flew away with the little preluding
cough which ushered in the declaration. And now I must be serious--Have
you heard from your father lately?â€

â€œNot a word,â€ I replied; â€œhe has not honoured me with a single line
during the several months of my residence here.â€

â€œThat is strange!--you are a singular race, you bold Osbaldistones. Then
you are not aware that he has gone to Holland, to arrange some pressing
affairs which required his own immediate presence?â€

â€œI never heard a word of it until this moment.â€

â€œAnd farther, it must be news to you, and I presume scarcely the most
agreeable, that he has left Rashleigh in the almost uncontrolled
management of his affairs until his return.â€

I started, and could not suppress my surprise and apprehension.

â€œYou have reason for alarm,â€ said Miss Vernon, very gravely; â€œand were I
you, I would endeavour to meet and obviate the dangers which arise from
so undesirable an arrangement.â€

â€œAnd how is it possible for me to do so?â€

â€œEverything is possible for him who possesses courage and activity,â€ she
said, with a look resembling one of those heroines of the age of
chivalry, whose encouragement was wont to give champions double valour at
the hour of need; â€œand to the timid and hesitating, everything is
impossible, because it seems so.â€

â€œAnd what would you advise, Miss Vernon?â€ I replied, wishing, yet
dreading, to hear her answer.

She paused a moment, then answered firmly--â€œThat you instantly leave
Osbaldistone Hall, and return to London. You have perhaps already,â€ she
continued, in a softer tone, â€œbeen here too long; that fault was not
yours. Every succeeding moment you waste here will be a crime. Yes, a
crime: for I tell you plainly, that if Rashleigh long manages your
fatherâ€™s affairs, you may consider his ruin as consummated.â€

â€œHow is this possible?â€

â€œAsk no questions,â€ she said; â€œbut believe me, Rashleighâ€™s views extend
far beyond the possession or increase of commercial wealth: he will only
make the command of Mr. Osbaldistoneâ€™s revenues and property the means of
putting in motion his own ambitious and extensive schemes. While your
father was in Britain this was impossible; during his absence, Rashleigh
will possess many opportunities, and he will not neglect to use them.â€

â€œBut how can I, in disgrace with my father, and divested of all control
over his affairs, prevent this danger by my mere presence in London?â€

â€œThat presence alone will do much. Your claim to interfere is a part of
your birthright, and it is inalienable. You will have the countenance,
doubtless, of your fatherâ€™s head-clerk, and confidential friends and
partners. Above all, Rashleighâ€™s schemes are of a nature thatâ€--(she
stopped abruptly, as if fearful of saying too much)--â€œare, in short,â€ she
resumed, â€œof the nature of all selfish and unconscientious plans, which
are speedily abandoned as soon as those who frame them perceive their
arts are discovered and watched. Therefore, in the language of your
favourite poet--

           To horse! to horse! Urge doubts to those that fear.â€

A feeling, irresistible in its impulse, induced me to reply--â€œAh! Diana,
can _you_ give me advice to leave Osbaldistone Hall?--then indeed I have
already been a resident here too long!â€

Miss Vernon coloured, but proceeded with great firmness--â€œIndeed, I do
give you this advice--not only to quit Osbaldistone Hall, but never to
return to it more. You have only one friend to regret here,â€ she
continued, forcing a smile, â€œand she has been long accustomed to
sacrifice her friendships and her comforts to the welfare of others.
In the world you will meet a hundred whose friendship will be
as disinterested--more useful--less encumbered by untoward
circumstances--less influenced by evil tongues and evil times.â€

â€œNever!â€ I exclaimed, â€œnever!--the world can afford me nothing to repay
what I must leave behind me.â€ Here I took her hand, and pressed it to my
lips.

â€œThis is folly!â€ she exclaimed--â€œthis is madness!â€ and she struggled to
withdraw her hand from my grasp, but not so stubbornly as actually to
succeed until I had held it for nearly a minute. â€œHear me, sir!â€ she
said, â€œand curb this unmanly burst of passion. I am, by a solemn
contract, the bride of Heaven, unless I could prefer being wedded to
villany in the person of Rashleigh Osbaldistone, or brutality in that of
his brother. I am, therefore, the bride of Heaven,--betrothed to the
convent from the cradle. To me, therefore, these raptures are
misapplied--they only serve to prove a farther necessity for your
departure, and that without delay.â€ At these words she broke suddenly
off, and said, but in a suppressed tone of voice, â€œLeave me
instantly--we will meet here again, but it must be for the last time.â€

My eyes followed the direction of hers as she spoke, and I thought I saw
the tapestry shake, which covered the door of the secret passage from
Rashleighâ€™s room to the library. I conceived we were observed, and turned
an inquiring glance on Miss Vernon.

â€œIt is nothing,â€ said she, faintly; â€œa rat behind the arras.â€

â€œDead for a ducat,â€ would have been my reply, had I dared to give way to
the feelings which rose indignant at the idea of being subjected to an
eaves-dropper on such an occasion. Prudence, and the necessity of
suppressing my passion, and obeying Dianaâ€™s reiterated command of â€œLeave
me! leave me!â€ came in time to prevent my rash action. I left the
apartment in a wild whirl and giddiness of mind, which I in vain
attempted to compose when I returned to my own.

A chaos of thoughts intruded themselves on me at once, passing hastily
through my brain, intercepting and overshadowing each other, and
resembling those fogs which in mountainous countries are wont to descend
in obscure volumes, and disfigure or obliterate the usual marks by which
the traveller steers his course through the wilds. The dark and undefined
idea of danger arising to my father from the machinations of such a man
as Rashleigh Osbaldistone--the half declaration of love that I had
offered to Miss Vernonâ€™s acceptance--the acknowledged difficulties of her
situation, bound by a previous contract to sacrifice herself to a
cloister or to an ill-assorted marriage,--all pressed themselves at once
upon my recollection, while my judgment was unable deliberately to
consider any of them in their just light and bearings. But chiefly and
above all the rest, I was perplexed by the manner in which Miss Vernon
had received my tender of affection, and by her manner, which,
fluctuating betwixt sympathy and firmness, seemed to intimate that I
possessed an interest in her bosom, but not of force sufficient to
counterbalance the obstacles to her avowing a mutual affection. The
glance of fear, rather than surprise, with which she had watched the
motion of the tapestry over the concealed door, implied an apprehension
of danger which I could not but suppose well grounded; for Diana Vernon
was little subject to the nervous emotions of her sex, and totally unapt
to fear without actual and rational cause. Of what nature could those
mysteries be, with which she was surrounded as with an enchanterâ€™s spell,
and which seemed continually to exert an active influence over her
thoughts and actions, though their agents were never visible? On this
subject of doubt my mind finally rested, as if glad to shake itself free
from investigating the propriety or prudence of my own conduct, by
transferring the inquiry to what concerned Miss Vernon. I will be
resolved, I concluded, ere I leave Osbaldistone Hall, concerning the
light in which I must in future regard this fascinating being, over whose
life frankness and mystery seem to have divided their reign,--the former
inspiring her words and sentiments--the latter spreading in misty
influence over all her actions.

Joined to the obvious interests which arose from curiosity and anxious
passion, there mingled in my feelings a strong, though unavowed and
undefined, infusion of jealousy. This sentiment, which springs up with
love as naturally as the tares with the wheat, was excited by the degree
of influence which Diana appeared to concede to those unseen beings by
whom her actions were limited. The more I reflected upon her character,
the more I was internally though unwillingly convinced, that she was
formed to set at defiance all control, excepting that which arose from
affection; and I felt a strong, bitter, and gnawing suspicion, that such
was the foundation of that influence by which she was overawed.

These tormenting doubts strengthened my desire to penetrate into the
secret of Miss Vernonâ€™s conduct, and in the prosecution of this sage
adventure, I formed a resolution, of which, if you are not weary of these
details, you will find the result in the next chapter.





CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.


                     I hear a voice you cannot hear,
                     Which says, I must not stay;
                     I see a hand you cannot see,
                           Which beckons me awry.
                                            Tickell.

I have already told you, Tresham, if you deign to bear it in remembrance,
that my evening visits to the library had seldom been made except by
appointment, and under the sanction of old Dame Marthaâ€™s presence. This,
however, was entirely a tacit conventional arrangement of my own
instituting. Of late, as the embarrassments of our relative situation had
increased, Miss Vernon and I had never met in the evening at all. She had
therefore no reason to suppose that I was likely to seek a renewal of
these interviews, and especially without some previous notice or
appointment betwixt us, that Martha might, as usual, be placed upon duty;
but, on the other hand, this cautionary provision was a matter of
understanding, not of express enactment. The library was open to me, as
to the other members of the family, at all hours of the day and night,
and I could not be accused of intrusion, however suddenly and
unexpectedly I might made my appearance in it. My belief was strong, that
in this apartment Miss Vernon occasionally received Vaughan, or some
other person, by whose opinion she was accustomed to regulate her
conduct, and that at the times when she could do so with least chance of
interruption. The lights which gleamed in the library at unusual
hours--the passing shadows which I had myself remarked--the footsteps
which might be traced in the morning-dew from the turret-door to the
postern-gate in the garden--sounds and sights which some of the servants,
and Andrew Fairservice in particular, had observed, and accounted for in
their own way,--all tended to show that the place was visited by some one
different from the ordinary inmates of the hall. Connected as this
visitant probably must be with the fates of Diana Vernon, I did not
hesitate to form a plan of discovering who or what he was,--how far his
influence was likely to produce good or evil consequences to her on whom
he acted;--above all, though I endeavoured to persuade myself that this
was a mere subordinate consideration, I desired to know by what means
this person had acquired or maintained his influence over Diana, and
whether he ruled over her by fear or by affection. The proof that this
jealous curiosity was uppermost in my mind, arose from my imagination
always ascribing Miss Vernonâ€™s conduct to the influence of some one
individual agent, although, for aught I knew about the matter, her
advisers might be as numerous am Legion. I remarked this over and over to
myself; but I found that my mind still settled back in my original
conviction, that one single individual, of the masculine sex, and in all
probability young and handsome, was at the bottom of Miss Vernonâ€™s
conduct; and it was with a burning desire of discovering, or rather of
detecting, such a rival, that I stationed myself in the garden to watch
the moment when the lights should appear in the library windows.

So eager, however, was my impatience, that I commenced my watch for a
phenomenon, which could not appear until darkness, a full hour before the
daylight disappeared, on a July evening. It was Sabbath, and all the
walks were still and solitary. I walked up and down for some time,
enjoying the refreshing coolness of a summer evening, and meditating on
the probable consequences of my enterprise. The fresh and balmy air of
the garden, impregnated with fragrance, produced its usual sedative
effects on my over-heated and feverish blood. As these took place, the
turmoil of my mind began proportionally to abate, and I was led to
question the right I had to interfere with Miss Vernonâ€™s secrets, or with
those of my uncleâ€™s family. What was it to me whom my uncle might choose
to conceal in his house, where I was myself a guest only by tolerance?
And what title had I to pry into the affairs of Miss Vernon, fraught, as
she had avowed them to be, with mystery, into which she desired no
scrutiny?

Passion and self-will were ready with their answers to these questions.
In detecting this secret, I was in all probability about to do service to
Sir Hildebrand, who was probably ignorant of the intrigues carried on in
his family--and a still more important service to Miss Vernon, whose
frank simplicity of character exposed her to so many risks in maintaining
a private correspondence, perhaps with a person of doubtful or dangerous
character. If I seemed to intrude myself on her confidence, it was with
the generous and disinterested (yes, I even ventured to call it the
_disinterested_) intention of guiding, defending, and protecting her
against craft--against malice,--above all, against the secret counsellor
whom she had chosen for her confidant. Such were the arguments which my
will boldly preferred to my conscience, as coin which ought to be
current, and which conscience, like a grumbling shopkeeper, was contented
to accept, rather than come to an open breach with a customer, though
more than doubting that the tender was spurious.

While I paced the green alleys, debating these things _pro_ and _con,_ I
suddenly alighted upon Andrew Fairservice, perched up like a statue by a
range of bee-hives, in an attitude of devout contemplation--one eye,
however, watching the motions of the little irritable citizens, who were
settling in their straw-thatched mansion for the evening, and the other
fixed on a book of devotion, which much attrition had deprived of its
corners, and worn into an oval shape; a circumstance which, with the
close print and dingy colour of the volume in question, gave it an air of
most respectable antiquity.

â€œI was eâ€™en taking a spell oâ€™ worthy Mess John Quacklebenâ€™s Flower of a
Sweet Savour sawn on the Middenstead of this World,â€ said Andrew, closing
his book at my appearance, and putting his horn spectacles, by way of
mark, at the place where he had been reading.

â€œAnd the bees, I observe, were dividing your attention, Andrew, with the
learned author?â€

â€œThey are a contumacious generation,â€ replied the gardener; â€œthey hae sax
days in the week to hive on, and yet itâ€™s a common observe that they will
aye swarm on the Sabbath-day, and keep folk at hame frae hearing the
word--But thereâ€™s nae preaching at Graneagain chapel the eâ€™en--thatâ€™s aye
ae mercy.â€

â€œYou might have gone to the parish church as I did, Andrew, and heard an
excellent discourse.â€

â€œClauts oâ€™ cauld parritch--clauts oâ€™ cauld parritch,â€ replied Andrew,
with a most supercilious sneer,--â€œgude aneueh for dogs, begging your
honourâ€™s pardon--Ay! I might nae doubt hae heard the curate linking awa
at it in his white sark yonder, and the musicians playing on whistles,
mair like a penny-wedding than a sermon--and to the boot of that, I might
hae gaen to even-song, and heard Daddie Docharty mumbling his
mass--muckle the better I wad hae been oâ€™ that!â€

â€œDocharty!â€ said I (this was the name of an old priest, an Irishman, I
think, who sometimes officiated at Osbaldistone Hall)--â€œI thought Father
Vaughan had been at the Hall. He was here yesterday.â€

â€œAy,â€ replied Andrew; â€œbut he left it yestreen, to gang to Greystock, or
some oâ€™ thae west-country haulds. Thereâ€™s an unco stir among them aâ€™
eâ€™enow. They are as busy as my bees are--God sain them! that I suld even
the puir things to the like oâ€™ papists. Ye see this is the second swarm,
and whiles they will swarm off in the afternoon. The first swarm set off
sune in the morning.--But I am thinking they are settled in their skeps
for the night; sae I wuss your honour good-night, and grace, and muckle
oâ€™t.â€

So saying, Andrew retreated, but often cast a parting glance upon the
_skeps,_ as he called the bee-hives.

I had indirectly gained from him an important piece of information, that
Father Vaughan, namely, was not supposed to be at the Hall. If,
therefore, there appeared light in the windows of the library this
evening, it either could not be his, or he was observing a very secret
and suspicious line of conduct. I waited with impatience the time of
sunset and of twilight. It had hardly arrived, ere a gleam from the
windows of the library was seen, dimly distinguishable amidst the still
enduring light of the evening. I marked its first glimpse, however, as
speedily as the benighted sailor descries the first distant twinkle of
the lighthouse which marks his course. The feelings of doubt and
propriety, which had hitherto contended with my curiosity and jealousy,
vanished when an opportunity of gratifying the former was presented to
me. I re-entered the house, and avoiding the more frequented apartments
with the consciousness of one who wishes to keep his purpose secret, I
reached the door of the library--hesitated for a moment as my hand was
upon the latch--heard a suppressed step within--opened the door--and
found Miss Vernon alone.

Diana appeared surprised,--whether at my sudden entrance, or from some
other cause, I could not guess; but there was in her appearance a degree
of flutter, which I had never before remarked, and which I knew could
only be produced by unusual emotion. Yet she was calm in a moment; and
such is the force of conscience, that I, who studied to surprise her,
seemed myself the surprised, and was certainly the embarrassed person.

â€œHas anything happened?â€ said Miss Vernon--â€œhas any one arrived at the
Hall?â€

â€œNo one that I know of,â€ I answered, in some confusion; â€œI only sought
the Orlando.â€

â€œIt lies there,â€ said Miss Vernon, pointing to the table. In removing one
or two books to get at that which I pretended to seek, I was, in truth,
meditating to make a handsome retreat from an investigation to which I
felt my assurance inadequate, when I perceived a manâ€™s glove lying upon
the table. My eyes encountered those of Miss Vernon, who blushed deeply.

â€œIt is one of my relics,â€ she said with hesitation, replying not to my
words but to my looks; â€œit is one of the gloves of my grandfather, the
original of the superb Vandyke which you admire.â€

As if she thought something more than her bare assertion was necessary to
prove her statement true, she opened a drawer of the large oaken table,
and taking out another glove, threw it towards me.--When a temper
naturally ingenuous stoops to equivocate, or to dissemble, the anxious
pain with which the unwonted task is laboured, often induces the hearer
to doubt the authenticity of the tale. I cast a hasty glance on both
gloves, and then replied gravely--â€œThe gloves resemble each other,
doubtless, in form and embroidery; but they cannot form a pair, since
they both belong to the right hand.â€

She bit her lip with anger, and again coloured deeply.

â€œYou do right to expose me,â€ she replied, with bitterness: â€œsome friends
would have only judged from what I said, that I chose to give no
particular explanation of a circumstance which calls for none--at least
to a stranger. You have judged better, and have made me feel, not only
the meanness of duplicity, but my own inadequacy to sustain the task of a
dissembler. I now tell you distinctly, that that glove is not the fellow,
as you have acutely discerned, to the one which I just now produced;--it
belongs to a friend yet dearer to me than the original of Vandykeâ€™s
picture--a friend by whose counsels I have been, and will be,
guided--whom I honour--whom Iâ€--she paused.

I was irritated at her manner, and filled up the blank in my own way--
â€œWhom she _loves_, Miss Vernon would say.â€

â€œAnd if I do say so,â€ she replied haughtily, â€œby whom shall my affection
be called to account?â€

â€œNot by me, Miss Vernon, assuredly--I entreat you to hold me acquitted of
such presumption.--_But,_â€ I continued, with some emphasis, for I was now
piqued in return, â€œI hope Miss Vernon will pardon a friend, from whom she
seems disposed to withdraw the title, for observingâ€--

â€œObserve nothing, sir,â€ she interrupted with some vehemence, â€œexcept that
I will neither be doubted nor questioned. There does not exist one by
whom I will be either interrogated or judged; and if you sought this
unusual time of presenting yourself in order to spy upon my privacy, the
friendship or interest with which you pretend to regard me, is a poor
excuse for your uncivil curiosity.â€

â€œI relieve you of my presence,â€ said I, with pride equal to her own; for
my temper has ever been a stranger to stooping, even in cases where my
feelings were most deeply interested--â€œI relieve you of my presence. I
awake from a pleasant, but a most delusive dream; and--but we understand
each other.â€

I had reached the door of the apartment, when Miss Vernon, whose
movements were sometimes so rapid as to seem almost instinctive, overtook
me, and, catching hold of my arm, stopped me with that air of authority
which she could so whimsically assume, and which, from the _naivete_ and
simplicity of her manner, had an effect so peculiarly interesting.

â€œStop, Mr. Frank,â€ she said, â€œyou are not to leave me in that way
neither; I am not so amply provided with friends, that I can afford to
throw away even the ungrateful and the selfish. Mark what I say, Mr.
Francis Osbaldistone. You shall know nothing of this mysterious glove,â€
 and she held it up as she spoke--â€œnothing--no, not a single iota more
than you know already; and yet I will not permit it to be a gauntlet of
strife and defiance betwixt us. My time here,â€ she said, sinking into a
tone somewhat softer, â€œmust necessarily be very short; yours must be
still shorter: we are soon to part never to meet again; do not let us
quarrel, or make any mysterious miseries the pretext for farther
embittering the few hours we shall ever pass together on this side of
eternity.â€

I do not know, Tresham, by what witchery this fascinating creature
obtained such complete management over a temper which I cannot at all
times manage myself. I had determined on entering the library, to seek a
complete explanation with Miss Vernon. I had found that she refused it
with indignant defiance, and avowed to my face the preference of a rival;
for what other construction could I put on her declared preference of her
mysterious confidant? And yet, while I was on the point of leaving the
apartment, and breaking with her for ever, it cost her but a change of
look and tone, from that of real and haughty resentment to that of kind
and playful despotism, again shaded off into melancholy and serious
feeling, to lead me back to my seat, her willing subject, on her own hard
terms.

â€œWhat does this avail?â€ said I, as I sate down. â€œWhat can this avail,
Miss Vernon? Why should I witness embarrassments which I cannot relieve,
and mysteries which I offend you even by attempting to penetrate?
Inexperienced as you are in the world, you must still be aware that a
beautiful young woman can have but one male friend. Even in a male friend
I will be jealous of a confidence shared with a third party unknown and
concealed; but with _you,_ Miss Vernonâ€--

â€œYou are, of course, jealous, in all the tenses and moods of that amiable
passion? But, my good friend, you have all this time spoke nothing but
the paltry gossip which simpletons repeat from play-books and romances,
till they give mere cant a real and powerful influence over their minds.
Boys and girls prate themselves into love; and when their love is like to
fall asleep, they prate and tease themselves into jealousy. But you and
I, Frank, are rational beings, and neither silly nor idle enough to talk
ourselves into any other relation than that of plain honest disinterested
friendship. Any other union is as far out of our reach as if I were man,
or you woman--To speak truth,â€ she added, after a momentâ€™s hesitation,
â€œeven though I am so complaisant to the decorum of my sex as to blush a
little at my own plain dealing, we cannot marry if we would; and we ought
not if we could.â€

And certainly, Tresham, she did blush most angelically, as she made this
cruel declaration. I was about to attack both her positions, entirely
forgetting those very suspicions which had been confirmed in the course
of the evening, but she proceeded with a cold firmness which approached
to severity--â€œWhat I say is sober and indisputable truth, on which I will
neither hear question nor explanation. We are therefore friends, Mr.
Osbaldistone--are we not?â€ She held out her hand, and taking mine,
added--â€œAnd nothing to each other now, or henceforward, except as
friends.â€

She let go my hand. I sunk it and my head at once, fairly _overcrowed,_
as Spenser would have termed it, by the mingled kindness and firmness of
her manner. She hastened to change the subject.

â€œHere is a letter,â€ she said, â€œdirected for you, Mr. Osbaldistone, very
duly and distinctly; but which, notwithstanding the caution of the person
who wrote and addressed it, might perhaps never have reached your hands,
had it not fallen into the possession of a certain Pacolet, or enchanted
dwarf of mine, whom, like all distressed damsels of romance, I retain in
my secret service.â€

I opened the letter and glanced over the contents. The unfolded sheet of
paper dropped from my hands, with the involuntary exclamation of
â€œGracious Heaven! my folly and disobedience have ruined my father!â€

Miss Vernon rose with looks of real and affectionate alarm--â€œYou grow
pale--you are ill--shall I bring you a glass of water? Be a man, Mr.
Osbaldistone, and a firm one. Is your father--is he no more?â€

â€œHe lives,â€ said I, â€œthank God! but to what distress and difficultyâ€--

â€œIf that be all, despair not. May I read this letter?â€ she said, taking
it up.

I assented, hardly knowing what I said. She read it with great attention.

â€œWho is this Mr. Tresham, who signs the letter?â€

â€œMy fatherâ€™s partnerâ€--(your own good father, Will)--â€œbut he is little in
the habit of acting personally in the business of the house.â€

â€œHe writes here,â€ said Miss Vernon, â€œof various letters sent to you
previously.â€

â€œI have received none of them,â€ I replied.

â€œAnd it appears,â€ she continued, â€œthat Rashleigh, who has taken the full
management of affairs during your fatherâ€™s absence in Holland, has some
time since left London for Scotland, with effects and remittances to take
up large bills granted by your father to persons in that country, and
that he has not since been heard of.â€

â€œIt is but too true.â€

â€œAnd here has been,â€ she added, looking at the letter, â€œa head-clerk, or
some such person,--Owenson--Owen--despatched to Glasgow, to find out
Rashleigh, if possible, and you are entreated to repair to the same
place, and assist him in his researches.â€

â€œIt is even so, and I must depart instantly.â€

â€œStay but one moment,â€ said Miss Vernon. â€œIt seems to me that the worst
which can come of this matter, will be the loss of a certain sum of
money;--and can that bring tears into your eyes? For shame, Mr.
Osbaldistone!â€

â€œYou do me injustice, Miss Vernon,â€ I answered. â€œI grieve not for the
loss of the money, but for the effect which I know it will produce on the
spirits and health of my father, to whom mercantile credit is as honour;
and who, if declared insolvent, would sink into the grave, oppressed by a
sense of grief, remorse, and despair, like that of a soldier convicted of
cowardice or a man of honour who had lost his rank and character in
society. All this I might have prevented by a trifling sacrifice of the
foolish pride and indolence which recoiled from sharing the labours of
his honourable and useful profession. Good Heaven! how shall I redeem the
consequences of my error?â€

â€œBy instantly repairing to Glasgow, as you are conjured to do by the
friend who writes this letter.â€

â€œBut if Rashleigh,â€ said I, â€œhas really formed this base and
unconscientious scheme of plundering his benefactor, what prospect is
there that I can find means of frustrating a plan so deeply laid?â€™

â€œThe prospect,â€ she replied, â€œindeed, may be uncertain; but, on the other
hand, there is no possibility of your doing any service to your father by
remaining here. Remember, had you been on the post destined for you, this
disaster could not have happened: hasten to that which is now pointed
out, and it may possibly be retrieved.--Yet stay--do not leave this room
until I return.â€

She left me in confusion and amazement; amid which, however, I could
find a lucid interval to admire the firmness, composure, and presence of
mind which Miss Vernon seemed to possess on every crisis, however sudden.

In a few minutes she returned with a sheet of paper in her hand, folded
and sealed like a letter, but without address. â€œI trust you,â€ she said,
â€œwith this proof of my friendship, because I have the most perfect
confidence in your honour. If I understand the nature of your distress
rightly, the funds in Rashleighâ€™s possession must be recovered by a
certain day--the 12th of September, I think is named--in order that they
may be applied to pay the bills in question; and, consequently, that if
adequate funds be provided before that period, your fatherâ€™s credit is
safe from the apprehended calamity.â€

â€œCertainly--I so understand Mr. Treshamâ€--I looked at your fatherâ€™s
letter again, and added, â€œThere cannot be a doubt of it.â€

â€œWell,â€ said Diana, â€œin that case my little Pacolet may be of use to you.
You have heard of a spell contained in a letter. Take this packet; do not
open it until other and ordinary means have failed. If you succeed by
your own exertions, I trust to your honour for destroying it without
opening or suffering it to be opened;--but if not, you may break the seal
within ten days of the fated day, and you will find directions which may
possibly be of service to you. Adieu, Frank; we never meet more--but
sometimes think of your friend Die Vernon.â€

She extended her hand, but I clasped her to my bosom. She sighed as she
extricated herself from the embrace which she permitted--escaped to the
door which led to her own apartment--and I saw her no more.

VOLUME TWO



CHAPTER FIRST

                   And hurry, hurry, off they rode,
                       As fast as fast might be;
                   Hurra, hurra, the dead can ride,
                       Dost fear to ride with me?
                                            Burger.

There is one advantage in an accumulation of evils, differing in cause
and character, that the distraction which they afford by their
contradictory operation prevents the patient from being overwhelmed under
either. I was deeply grieved at my separation from Miss Vernon, yet not
so much so as I should have been, had not my fatherâ€™s apprehended
distresses forced themselves on my attention; and I was distressed by the
news of Mr. Tresham, yet less so than if they had fully occupied my mind.
I was neither a false lover nor an unfeeling son; but man can give but a
certain portion of distressful emotions to the causes which demand them;
and if two operate at once, our sympathy, like the funds of a compounding
bankrupt, can only be divided between them. Such were my reflections when
I gained my apartment--it seems, from the illustration, they already
began to have a twang of commerce in them.

I set myself seriously to consider your fatherâ€™s letter. It was not very
distinct, and referred for several particulars to Owen, whom I was
entreated to meet with as soon as possible at a Scotch town called
Glasgow; being informed, moreover, that my old friend was to be heard of
at Messrs. MacVittie, MacFin, and Company, merchants in the Gallowgate of
the said town. It likewise alluded to several letters,--which, as it
appeared to me, must have miscarried or have been intercepted, and
complained of my obdurate silence, in terms which would have, been highly
unjust, had my letters reached their purposed destination. I was amazed
as I read. That the spirit of Rashleigh walked around me, and conjured up
these doubts and difficulties by which I was surrounded, I could not
doubt for one instant; yet it was frightful to conceive the extent of
combined villany and power which he must have employed in the
perpetration of his designs. Let me do myself justice in one respect. The
evil of parting from Miss Vernon, however distressing it might in other
respects and at another time have appeared to me, sunk into a subordinate
consideration when I thought of the dangers impending over my father. I
did not myself set a high estimation on wealth, and had the affectation
of most young men of lively imagination, who suppose that they can better
dispense with the possession of money, than resign their time and
faculties to the labour necessary to acquire it. But in my fatherâ€™s case,
I knew that bankruptcy would be considered as an utter and irretrievable
disgrace, to which life would afford no comfort, and death the speediest
and sole relief.

My mind, therefore, was bent on averting this catastrophe, with an
intensity which the interest could not have produced had it referred to
my own fortunes; and the result of my deliberation was a firm resolution
to depart from Osbaldistone Hall the next day and wend my way without
loss of time to meet Owen at Glasgow. I did not hold it expedient to
intimate my departure to my uncle, otherwise than by leaving a letter of
thanks for his hospitality, assuring him that sudden and important
business prevented my offering them in person. I knew the blunt old
knight would readily excuse ceremony; and I had such a belief in the
extent and decided character of Rashleighâ€™s machinations, that I had some
apprehension of his having provided means to intercept a journey which
was undertaken with a view to disconcert them, if my departure were
publicly announced at Osbaldistone Hall.

I therefore determined to set off on my journey with daylight on the
ensuing morning, and to gain the neighbouring kingdom of Scotland before
any idea of my departure was entertained at the Hall. But one impediment
of consequence was likely to prevent that speed which was the soul of my
expedition. I did not know the shortest, nor indeed any road to Glasgow;
and as, in the circumstances in which I stood, despatch was of the
greatest consequence, I determined to consult Andrew Fairservice on the
subject, as the nearest and most authentic authority within my reach.
Late as it was, I set off with the intention of ascertaining this
important point, and after a few minutesâ€™ walk reached the dwelling of
the gardener.

Andrewâ€™s dwelling was situated at no great distance from the exterior
wall of the garden--a snug comfortable Northumbrian cottage, built of
stones roughly dressed with the hammer, and having the windows and doors
decorated with huge heavy architraves, or lintels, as they are called, of
hewn stone, and its roof covered with broad grey flags, instead of
slates, thatch, or tiles. A jargonelle pear-tree at one end of the
cottage, a rivulet and flower-plot of a rood in extent in front, and a
kitchen-garden behind; a paddock for a cow, and a small field, cultivated
with several crops of grain, rather for the benefit of the cottager than
for sale, announced the warm and cordial comforts which Old England, even
at her most northern extremity, extends to her meanest inhabitants.

As I approached the mansion of the sapient Andrew, I heard a noise,
which, being of a nature peculiarly solemn, nasal, and prolonged, led me
to think that Andrew, according to the decent and meritorious custom of
his countrymen, had assembled some of his neighbours to join in family
exercise, as he called evening devotion. Andrew had indeed neither wife,
child, nor female inmate in his family. â€œThe first of his trade,â€ he
said, â€œhad had eneugh oâ€™thae cattle.â€ But, notwithstanding, he sometimes
contrived to form an audience for himself out of the neighbouring Papists
and Church-of-Englandmen--brands, as he expressed it, snatched out of the
burning, on whom he used to exercise his spiritual gifts, in defiance
alike of Father Vaughan, Father Docharty, Rashleigh, and all the world of
Catholics around him, who deemed his interference on such occasions an
act of heretical interloping. I conceived it likely, therefore, that the
well-disposed neighbours might have assembled to hold some chapel of ease
of this nature. The noise, however, when I listened to it more
accurately, seemed to proceed entirely from the lungs of the said Andrew;
and when I interrupted it by entering the house, I found Fairservice
alone, combating as he best could, with long words and hard names, and
reading aloud, for the purpose of his own edification, a volume of
controversial divinity.

â€œI was just taking a spell,â€ said he, laying aside the huge folio volume
as I entered, â€œof the worthy Doctor Lightfoot.â€

â€œLightfoot!â€ I replied, looking at the ponderous volume with some
surprise; â€œsurely your author was unhappily named.â€

â€œLightfoot was his name, sir; a divine he was, and another kind of a
divine than they hae now-adays. Always, I crave your pardon for keeping
ye standing at the door, but having been mistrysted (gude preserve us!)
with ae bogle the night already, I was dubious oâ€™ opening the yett till I
had gaen through the eâ€™ening worship; and I had just finished the fifth
chapter of Nehemiah--if that winna gar them keep their distance, I wotna
what will.â€

â€œTrysted with a bogle!â€ said I; â€œwhat do you mean by that, Andrew?â€

â€œI said mistrysted,â€ replied Andrew; â€œthat is as muckle as to say, fleyâ€™d
wiâ€™ a ghaist--Gude preserve us, I say again!â€

â€œFlayâ€™d by a ghost, Andrew! how am I to understand that?â€

â€œI did not say flayâ€™d,â€ replied Andrew, â€œbut _fleyâ€™d,_--that is, I got a
fleg, and was ready to jump out oâ€™ my skin, though naebody offered to
whirl it aff my body as a man wad bark a tree.â€

â€œI beg a truce to your terrors in the present case, Andrew, and I wish to
know whether you can direct me the nearest way to a town in your country
of Scotland, called Glasgow?â€

â€œA town caâ€™d Glasgow!â€ echoed Andrew Fairservice. â€œGlasgowâ€™s a ceety,
man.--And isâ€™t the way to Glasgow ye were speering if I kenâ€™d?--What suld
ail me to ken it?--itâ€™s no that dooms far frae my ain parish of
Dreepdaily, that lies a bittock farther to the west. But what may your
honour be gaun to Glasgow for?â€

â€œParticular business,â€ replied I.

â€œThatâ€™s as muckle as to say, Speer nae questions, and Iâ€™ll tell ye nae
lees.--To Glasgow?â€--he made a short pause--â€œI am thinking ye wad be the
better oâ€™ some ane to show you the road.â€

â€œCertainly, if I could meet with any person going that way.â€

â€œAnd your honour, doubtless, wad consider the time and trouble?â€

â€œUnquestionably--my business is pressing, and if you can find any guide
to accompany me, Iâ€™ll pay him handsomely.â€

â€œThis is no a day to speak oâ€™ carnal matters,â€ said Andrew, casting his
eyes upwards; â€œbut if it werena Sabbath at eâ€™en, I wad speer what ye wad
be content to gie to ane that wad bear ye pleasant company on the road,
and tell ye the names of the gentlemenâ€™s and noblemenâ€™s seats and
castles, and count their kin to ye?â€

â€œI tell you, all I want to know is the road I must travel; I will pay the
fellow to his satisfaction--I will give him anything in reason.â€

â€œOnything,â€ replied Andrew, â€œis naething; and this lad that I am speaking
oâ€™ kens aâ€™ the short cuts and queer by-paths through the hills, andâ€--

â€œI have no time to talk about it, Andrew; do you make the bargain for me
your own way.â€

â€œAha! thatâ€™s speaking to the purpose,â€ answered Andrew.--â€œI am thinking,
since sae be that sae it is, Iâ€™ll be the lad that will guide you mysell.â€

â€œYou, Andrew?--how will you get away from your employment?â€

â€œI tellâ€™d your honour a while syne, that it was lang that I hae been
thinking oâ€™ flitting, maybe as lang as frae the first year I came to
Osbaldistone Hall; and now I am oâ€™ the mind to gang in gude
earnest--better soon as syne--better a finger aff as aye wagging.â€

â€œYou leave your service, then?--but will you not lose your wages?â€

â€œNae doubt there will be a certain loss; but then I hae siller oâ€™ the
lairdâ€™s in my hands that I took for the apples in the auld orchyard--and
a sair bargain the folk had that bought them--a wheen green trash--and
yet Sir Hildebrandâ€™s as keen to hae the siller (that is, the steward is
as pressing about it) as if they had been aâ€™ gowden pippins--and then
thereâ€™s the siller for the seeds--Iâ€™m thinking the wage will be in a
manner decently made up.--But doubtless your honour will consider my risk
of loss when we win to Glasgow--and yeâ€™ll be for setting out forthwith?â€

â€œBy day-break in the morning,â€ I answered.

â€œThatâ€™s something oâ€™ the suddenest--whare am I to find a naig?--Stay--I
ken just the beast that will answer me.â€

â€œAt five in the morning, then, Andrew, you will meet me at the head of
the avenue.â€

â€œDeil a fear oâ€™ me (that I suld say sae) missing my tryste,â€ replied
Andrew, very briskly; â€œand if I might advise, we wad be aff twa hours
earlier. I ken the way, dark or light, as weel as blind Ralph Ronaldson,
thatâ€™s travelled ower every moor in the country-side, and disna ken the
colour of a heather-cowe when aâ€™s dune.â€

I highly approved of Andrewâ€™s amendment on my original proposal, and we
agreed to meet at the place appointed at three in the morning. At once,
however, a reflection came across the mind of my intended travelling
companion.

â€œThe bogle! the bogle! what if it should come out upon us?--I downa
forgather wiâ€™ thae things twice in the four-and-twenty hours.â€

â€œPooh! pooh!â€ I exclaimed, breaking away from him, â€œfear nothing from the
next world--the earth contains living fiends, who can act for themselves
without assistance, were the whole host that fell with Lucifer to return
to aid and abet them.â€

With these words, the import of which was suggested by my own situation,
I left Andrewâ€™s habitation, and returned to the Hall.

I made the few preparations which were necessary for my proposed journey,
examined and loaded my pistols, and then threw myself on my bed, to
obtain, if possible, a brief sleep before the fatigue of a long and
anxious journey. Nature, exhausted by the tumultuous agitations of the
day, was kinder to me than I expected, and I stink into a deep and
profound slumber, from which, however, I started as the old clock struck
two from a turret adjoining to my bedchamber. I instantly arose, struck a
light, wrote the letter I proposed to leave for my uncle, and leaving
behind me such articles of dress as were cumbrous in carriage, I
deposited the rest of my wardrobe in my valise, glided down stairs, and
gained the stable without impediment. Without being quite such a groom as
any of my cousins, I had learned at Osbaldistone Hall to dress and saddle
my own horse, and in a few minutes I was mounted and ready for my sally.

As I paced up the old avenue, on which the waning moon threw its light
with a pale and whitish tinge, I looked back with a deep and boding sigh
towards the walls which contained Diana Vernon, under the despondent
impression that we had probably parted to meet no more. It was
impossible, among the long and irregular lines of Gothic casements, which
now looked ghastly white in the moonlight, to distinguish that of the
apartment which she inhabited. â€œShe is lost to me already,â€ thought I, as
my eye wandered over the dim and indistinguishable intricacies of
architecture offered by the moonlight view of Osbaldistone Hall--â€œShe is
lost to me already, ere I have left the place which she inhabits! What
hope is there of my maintaining any correspondence with her, when leagues
shall lie between?â€

While I paused in a reverie of no very pleasing nature, the â€œiron tongue
of time told three upon the drowsy ear of night,â€ and reminded me of the
necessity of keeping my appointment with a person of a less interesting
description and appearance--Andrew Fairservice.

At the gate of the avenue I found a horseman stationed in the shadow of
the wall, but it was not until I had coughed twice, and then called
â€œAndrew,â€ that the horticulturist replied, â€œIâ€™se warrant itâ€™s Andrew.â€

â€œLead the way, then,â€ said I, â€œand be silent if you can, till we are past
the hamlet in the valley.â€

Andrew led the way accordingly, and at a much brisker pace than I would
have recommended.--and so well did he obey my injunctions of keeping
silence, that he would return no answer to my repeated inquiries into the
cause of such unnecessary haste. Extricating ourselves by short cuts,
known to Andrew, from the numerous stony lanes and by-paths which
intersected each other in the vicinity of the Hall, we reached the open
heath and riding swiftly across it, took our course among the barren
hills which divide England from Scotland on what are called the Middle
Marches. The way, or rather the broken track which we occupied, was a
happy interchange of bog and shingles; nevertheless, Andrew relented
nothing of his speed, but trotted manfully forward at the rate of eight
or ten miles an hour. I was both surprised and provoked at the fellowâ€™s
obstinate persistence, for we made abrupt ascents and descents over
ground of a very break-neck character, and traversed the edge of
precipices, where a slip of the horseâ€™s feet would have consigned the
rider to certain death. The moon, at best, afforded a dubious and
imperfect light; but in some places we were so much under the shade of
the mountain as to be in total darkness, and then I could only trace
Andrew by the clatter of his horseâ€™s feet, and the fire which they struck
from the flints. At first, this rapid motion, and the attention which,
for the sake of personal safety, I was compelled to give to the conduct
of my horse, was of service, by forcibly diverting my thoughts from the
various painful reflections which must otherwise have pressed on my mind.
But at length, after hallooing repeatedly to Andrew to ride slower, I
became seriously incensed at his impudent perseverance in refusing either
to obey or to reply to me. My anger was, however, quite impotent. I
attempted once or twice to get up alongside of my self-willed guide, with
the purpose of knocking him off his horse with the butt-end of my whip;
but Andrew was better mounted than I, and either the spirit of the animal
which he bestrode, or more probably some presentiment of my kind
intentions towards him, induced him to quicken his pace whenever I
attempted to make up to him. On the other hand, I was compelled to exert
my spurs to keep him in sight, for without his guidance I was too well
aware that I should never find my way through the howling wilderness
which we now traversed at such an unwonted pace. I was so angry at
length, that I threatened to have recourse to my pistols, and send a
bullet after the Hotspur Andrew, which should stop his fiery-footed
career, if he did not abate it of his own accord. Apparently this threat
made some impression on the tympanum of his ear, however deaf to all my
milder entreaties; for he relaxed his pace upon hearing it, and,
suffering me to close up to him, observed, â€œThere wasna muckle sense in
riding at sic a daft-like gate.â€

â€œAnd what did you mean by doing so at all, you self-willed scoundrel?â€
 replied I; for I was in a towering passion,--to which, by the way,
nothing contributes more than the having recently undergone a spice of
personal fear, which, like a few drops of water flung on a glowing fire,
is sure to inflame the ardour which it is insufficient to quench.

â€œWhatâ€™s your honourâ€™s wull?â€ replied Andrew, with impenetrable gravity.

â€œMy will, you rascal?--I have been roaring to you this hour to ride
slower, and you have never so much as answered me--Are you drunk or mad
to behave so?â€

â€œAn it like your honour, I am something dull oâ€™ hearing; and Iâ€™ll no deny
but I might have maybe taen a stirrup-cup at parting frae the auld
bigging whare I hae dwelt sae lang; and having naebody to pledge, nae
doubt I was obliged to do mysell reason, or else leave the end oâ€™ the
brandy stoup to thae papists--and that wad be a waste, as your honour
kens.â€

This might be all very true,--and my circumstances required that I should
be on good terms with my guide; I therefore satisfied myself with
requiring of him to take his directions from me in future concerning the
rate of travelling.

Andrew, emboldened by the mildness of my tone, elevated his own into the
pedantic, conceited octave, which was familiar to him on most occasions.

â€œYour honour winna persuade me, and naebody shall persuade me, that itâ€™s
either halesome or prudent to tak the night air on thae moors without a
cordial oâ€™ clow-gilliflower water, or a tass of brandy or aquavitae, or
sic-like creature-comfort. I hae taen the bent ower the Otterscrape-rigg
a hundred times, day and night, and never could find the way unless I had
taen my morning; mair by token that I had whiles twa bits oâ€™ ankers oâ€™
brandy on ilk side oâ€™ me.â€--

â€œIn other words, Andrew,â€ said I, â€œyou were a smuggler--how does a man of
your strict principles reconcile yourself to cheat the revenue?â€

â€œItâ€™s a mere spoiling oâ€™ the Egyptians,â€ replied Andrew; â€œpuir auld
Scotland suffers eneugh by thae blackguard loons oâ€™ excisemen and
gaugers, that hae come down on her like locusts since the sad and
sorrowfuâ€™ Union; itâ€™s the part of a kind son to bring her a soup oâ€™
something that will keep up her auld heart,--and that will they nill
they, the ill-faâ€™ard thieves!â€

Upon more particular inquiry, I found Andrew had frequently travelled
these mountain-paths as a smuggler, both before and after his
establishment at Osbaldistone Hall--a circumstance which was so far of
importance to me, as it proved his capacity as a guide, notwithstanding
the escapade of which he had been guilty at his outset. Even now, though
travelling at a more moderate pace, the stirrup-cup, or whatever else had
such an effect in stimulating Andrewâ€™s motions, seemed not totally to
have lost its influence. He often cast a nervous and startled look behind
him; and whenever the road seemed at all practicable, showed symptoms of
a desire to accelerate his pace, as if he feared some pursuit from the
rear. These appearances of alarm gradually diminished as we reached the
top of a high bleak ridge, which ran nearly east and west for about a
mile, with a very steep descent on either side. The pale beams of the
morning were now enlightening the horizon, when Andrew cast a look behind
him, and not seeing the appearance of a living being on the moors which
he had travelled, his hard features gradually unbent, as he first
whistled, then sung, with much glee and little melody, the end of one of
his native songs--

                    â€œJenny, lass! I think I hae her
                     Ower the muir amang the heather,
                     All their clan shall never get her.â€

He patted at the same time the neck of the horse which had carried him so
gallantly; and my attention being directed by that action to the animal,
I instantly recognised a favourite mare of Thorncliff Osbaldistone. â€œHow
is this, sir?â€ said I sternly; â€œthat is Mr. Thorncliffâ€™s mare!â€

â€œIâ€™ll no say but she may aiblins hae been his honourâ€™s Squire
Thorncliffâ€™s in her day--but sheâ€™s mine now.â€

â€œYou have stolen her, you rascal.â€

â€œNa, na, sir--nae man can wyte me wiâ€™ theft. The thing stands this gate,
ye see. Squire Thorncliff borrowed ten punds oâ€™ me to gang to York
Races--deil a boddle wad he pay me back again, and spake oâ€™ raddling my
banes, as he caâ€™d it, when I asked him but for my ain back again;--now I
think it will riddle him or he gets his horse ower the Border
again--unless he pays me plack and bawbee, he sall never see a hair oâ€™
her tail. I ken a canny chield at Loughmaben, a bit writer lad, that
will put me in the way to sort him. Steal the mear! na, na, far be the
sin oâ€™ theft frae Andrew Fairservice--I have just arrested her
_jurisdictionis fandandy causey._ Thae are bonny writer words--amaist
like the language oâ€™ huz gardeners and other learned men--itâ€™s a pity
theyâ€™re sae dear;--thae three words were aâ€™ that Andrew got for a lang
law-plea and four ankers oâ€™ as gude brandy as was eâ€™er coupit ower
craig--Hech, sirs! but lawâ€™s a dear thing.â€

â€œYou are likely to find it much dearer than you suppose, Andrew, if you
proceed in this mode of paying yourself, without legal authority.â€

â€œHout tout, weâ€™re in Scotland now (be praised forâ€™t!) and I can find
baith friends and lawyers, and judges too, as weel as ony Osbaldistone oâ€™
them aâ€™. My mitherâ€™s mitherâ€™s third cousin was cousin to the Provost oâ€™
Dumfries, and he winna see a drap oâ€™ her blude wranged. Hout awa! the
laws are indifferently administered here to aâ€™ men alike; itâ€™s no like on
yon side, when a chield may be whuppit awaâ€™ wiâ€™ ane oâ€™ Clerk Jobsonâ€™s
warrants, afore he kens where he is. But they will hae little enough law
amang them by and by, and that is ae grand reason that I hae giâ€™en them
gude-day.â€

I was highly provoked at the achievement of Andrew, and considered it as
a hard fate, which a second time threw me into collision with a person of
such irregular practices. I determined, however, to buy the mare of him,
when he should reach the end of our journey, and send her back to my
cousin at Osbaldistone Hall; and with this purpose of reparation I
resolved to make my uncle acquainted from the next post-town. It was
needless, I thought, to quarrel with Andrew in the meantime, who had,
after all, acted not very unnaturally for a person in his circumstances.
I therefore smothered my resentment, and asked him what he meant by his
last expressions, that there would be little law in Northumberland by and
by?

â€œLaw!â€ said Andrew, â€œhout, ay--there will be club-law eneugh. The priests
and the Irish officers, and thae papist cattle that hae been sodgering
abroad, because they durstna bide at hame, are aâ€™ fleeing thick in
Northumberland eâ€™enow; and thae corbies dinna gather without they smell
carrion. As sure as ye live, his honour Sir Hildebrand is gaun to stick
his horn in the bog--thereâ€™s naething but gun and pistol, sword and
dagger, amang them--and theyâ€™ll be laying on, Iâ€™se warrant; for theyâ€™re
fearless fules the young Osbaldistone squires, aye craving your honourâ€™s
pardon.â€

This speech recalled to my memory some suspicions that I myself had
entertained, that the Jacobites were on the eve of some desperate
enterprise. But, conscious it did not become me to be a spy on my uncleâ€™s
words and actions, I had rather avoided than availed myself of any
opportunity which occurred of remarking upon the signs of the times.--
Andrew Fairservice felt no such restraint, and doubtless spoke very truly
in stating his conviction that some desperate plots were in agitation, as
a reason which determined his resolution to leave the Hall.

â€œThe servants,â€ he stated, â€œwith the tenantry and others, had been all
regularly enrolled and mustered, and they wanted me to take arms also.
But Iâ€™ll ride in nae siccan troop--they little kenâ€™d Andrew that asked
him. Iâ€™ll fight when I like mysell, but it sall neither be for the hure
oâ€™ Babylon, nor any hure in England.â€





CHAPTER SECOND.


                 Where longs to fall yon rifted spire,
                     As weary of the insulting air,--
                 The poetâ€™s thoughts, the warriorâ€™s fire,
                     The loverâ€™s sighs, are sleeping there.
                                             Langhorne.

At the first Scotch town which we reached, my guide sought out his friend
and counsellor, to consult upon the proper and legal means of converting
into his own lawful property the â€œbonny creature,â€ which was at present
his own only by one of those sleight-of-hand arrangements which still
sometimes took place in that once lawless district. I was somewhat
diverted with the dejection of his looks on his return. He had, it seems,
been rather too communicative to his confidential friend, the attorney;
and learned with great dismay, in return for his unsuspecting frankness,
that Mr. Touthope had, during his absence, been appointed clerk to the
peace of the county, and was bound to communicate to justice all such
achievements as that of his friend Mr. Andrew Fairservice. There was a
necessity, this alert member of the police stated, for arresting the
horse, and placing him in Bailie Trumbullâ€™s stable, therein to remain at
livery, at the rate of twelve shillings (Scotch) per diem, until the
question of property was duly tried and debated. He even talked as if, in
strict and rigorous execution of his duty, he ought to detain honest
Andrew himself; but on my guideâ€™s most piteously entreating his
forbearance, he not only desisted from this proposal, but made a present
to Andrew of a broken-winded and spavined pony, in order to enable him to
pursue his journey. It is true, he qualified this act of generosity by
exacting from poor Andrew an absolute cession of his right and interest
in the gallant palfrey of Thorncliff Osbaldistone--a transference which
Mr. Touthope represented as of very little consequence, since his
unfortunate friend, as he facetiously observed, was likely to get nothing
of the mare excepting the halter.

Andrew seemed woeful and disconcerted, as I screwed out of him these
particulars; for his northern pride was cruelly pinched by being
compelled to admit that attorneys were attorneys on both sides of the
Tweed; and that Mr. Clerk Touthope was not a farthing more sterling coin
than Mr. Clerk Jobson.

â€œIt wadna hae vexed him half sae muckle to hae been cheated out oâ€™ what
might amaist be said to be won with the peril oâ€™ his craig, had it
happened amang the Inglishers; but it was an unco thing to see hawks pike
out hawksâ€™ eâ€™en, or ae kindly Scot cheat anither. But nae doubt things
were strangely changed in his country sinâ€™ the sad and sorrowfuâ€™ Union;â€
 an event to which Andrew referred every symptom of depravity or
degeneracy which he remarked among his countrymen, more especially the
inflammation of reckonings, the diminished size of pint-stoups, and other
grievances, which he pointed out to me during our journey.

For my own part, I held myself, as things had turned out, acquitted of
all charge of the mare, and wrote to my uncle the circumstances under
which she was carried into Scotland, concluding with informing him that
she was in the hands of justice, and her worthy representatives, Bailie
Trumbull and Mr. Clerk Touthope, to whom I referred him for farther
particulars. Whether the property returned to the Northumbrian
fox-hunter, or continued to bear the person of the Scottish attorney, it
is unnecessary for me at present to say.

We now pursued our journey to the north-westward, at a rate much slower
than that at which we had achieved our nocturnal retreat from England.
One chain of barren and uninteresting hills succeeded another, until the
more fertile vale of Clyde opened upon us; and, with such despatch as we
might, we gained the town, or, as my guide pertinaciously termed it, the
city, of Glasgow. Of late years, I understand, it has fully deserved the
name, which, by a sort of political second sight, my guide assigned to
it. An extensive and increasing trade with the West Indies and American
colonies, has, if I am rightly informed, laid the foundation of wealth
and prosperity, which, if carefully strengthened and built upon, may one
day support an immense fabric of commercial prosperity; but in the
earlier time of which I speak, the dawn of this splendour had not arisen.
The Union had, indeed, opened to Scotland the trade of the English
colonies; but, betwixt want of capital, and the national jealousy of the
English, the merchants of Scotland were as yet excluded, in a great
measure, from the exercise of the privileges which that memorable treaty
conferred on them. Glasgow lay on the wrong side of the island for
participating in the east country or continental trade, by which the
trifling commerce as yet possessed by Scotland chiefly supported itself.
Yet, though she then gave small promise of the commercial eminence to
which, I am informed, she seems now likely one day to attain, Glasgow, as
the principal central town of the western district of Scotland, was a
place of considerable rank and importance. The broad and brimming Clyde,
which flows so near its walls, gave the means of an inland navigation of
some importance. Not only the fertile plains in its immediate
neighbourhood, but the districts of Ayr and Dumfries regarded Glasgow as
their capital, to which they transmitted their produce, and received in
return such necessaries and luxuries as their consumption required.

The dusky mountains of the western Highlands often sent forth wilder
tribes to frequent the marts of St. Mungoâ€™s favourite city. Hordes of
wild shaggy, dwarfish cattle and ponies, conducted by Highlanders, as
wild, as shaggy, and sometimes as dwarfish, as the animals they had in
charge, often traversed the streets of Glasgow. Strangers gazed with
surprise on the antique and fantastic dress, and listened to the unknown
and dissonant sounds of their language, while the mountaineers, armed,
even while engaged in this peaceful occupation, with musket and pistol,
sword, dagger, and target, stared with astonishment on the articles of
luxury of which they knew not the use, and with an avidity which seemed
somewhat alarming on the articles which they knew and valued. It is
always with unwillingness that the Highlander quits his deserts, and at
this early period it was like tearing a pine from its rock, to plant him
elsewhere. Yet even then the mountain glens were over-peopled, although
thinned occasionally by famine or by the sword, and many of their
inhabitants strayed down to Glasgow--there formed settlements--there
sought and found employment, although different, indeed, from that of
their native hills. This supply of a hardy and useful population was of
consequence to the prosperity of the place, furnished the means of
carrying on the few manufactures which the town already boasted, and laid
the foundation of its future prosperity.

The exterior of the city corresponded with these promising circumstances.
The principal street was broad and important, decorated with public
buildings, of an architecture rather striking than correct in point of
taste, and running between rows of tall houses, built of stone, the
fronts of which were occasionally richly ornamented with mason-work--a
circumstance which gave the street an imposing air of dignity and
grandeur, of which most English towns are in some measure deprived, by
the slight, insubstantial, and perishable quality and appearance of the
bricks with which they are constructed.

In the western metropolis of Scotland, my guide and I arrived on a
Saturday evening, too late to entertain thoughts of business of any kind.
We alighted at the door of a jolly hostler-wife, as Andrew called
her,--the Ostelere of old father Chaucer,--by whom we were civilly
received.

On the following morning the bells pealed from every steeple, announcing
the sanctity of the day. Notwithstanding, however, what I had heard of
the severity with which the Sabbath is observed in Scotland, my first
impulse, not unnaturally, was to seek out Owen; but on inquiry I found
that my attempt would be in vain, â€œuntil kirk time was ower.â€ Not only
did my landlady and guide jointly assure me that â€œthere wadna be a living
soul either in the counting-house or dwelling-house of Messrs. MacVittie,
MacFin, and Company,â€ to which Owenâ€™s letter referred me, but, moreover,
â€œfar less would I find any of the partners there. They were serious men,
and wad be where aâ€™ gude Christians ought to be at sic a time, and that
was in the Barony Laigh Kirk.â€ 

Andrew Fairservice, whose disgust at the law of his country had
fortunately not extended itself to the other learned professions of his
native land, now sung forth the praises of the preacher who was to
perform the duty, to which my hostess replied with many loud amens. The
result was, that I determined to go to this popular place of worship, as
much with the purpose of learning, if possible, whether Owen had arrived
in Glasgow, as with any great expectation of edification. My hopes were
exalted by the assurance, that if Mr. Ephraim MacVittie (worthy man) were
in the land of life, he would surely honour the Barony Kirk that day with
his presence; and if he chanced to have a stranger within his gates,
doubtless he would bring him to the duty along with him. This probability
determined my motions, and under the escort of my faithful Andrew, I set
forth for the Barony Kirk.

On this occasion, however, I had little need of his guidance; for the
crowd, which forced its way up a steep and rough-paved street, to hear
the most popular preacher in the west of Scotland, would of itself have
swept me along with it. On attaining the summit of the hill, we turned to
the left, and a large pair of folding doors admitted us, amongst others,
into the open and extensive burying-place which surrounds the Minster or
Cathedral Church of Glasgow. The pile is of a gloomy and massive, rather
than of an elegant, style of Gothic architecture; but its peculiar
character is so strongly preserved, and so well suited with the
accompaniments that surround it, that the impression of the first view
was awful and solemn in the extreme. I was indeed so much struck, that I
resisted for a few minutes all Andrewâ€™s efforts to drag me into the
interior of the building, so deeply was I engaged in surveying its
outward character.

Situated in a populous and considerable town, this ancient and massive
pile has the appearance of the most sequestered solitude. High walls
divide it from the buildings of the city on one side; on the other it is
bounded by a ravine, at the bottom of which, and invisible to the eye,
murmurs a wandering rivulet, adding, by its gentle noise, to the imposing
solemnity of the scene. On the opposite side of the ravine rises a steep
bank, covered with fir-trees closely planted, whose dusky shade extends
itself over the cemetery with an appropriate and gloomy effect. The
churchyard itself had a peculiar character; for though in reality
extensive, it is small in proportion to the number of respectable
inhabitants who are interred within it, and whose graves are almost all
covered with tombstones. There is therefore no room for the long rank
grass, which, in most cases, partially clothes the surface of those
retreats where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at
rest. The broad flat monumental stones are placed so close to each other,
that the precincts appear to be flagged with them, and, though roofed
only by the heavens, resemble the floor of one of our old English
churches, where the pavement is covered with sepulchral inscriptions. The
contents of these sad records of mortality, the vain sorrows which they
preserve, the stern lesson which they teach of the nothingness of
humanity, the extent of ground which they so closely cover, and their
uniform and melancholy tenor, reminded me of the roll of the prophet,
which was â€œwritten within and without, and there was written therein
lamentations and mourning and woe.â€

The Cathedral itself corresponds in impressive majesty with these
accompaniments. We feel that its appearance is heavy, yet that the effect
produced would be destroyed were it lighter or more ornamental. It is the
only metropolitan church in Scotland, excepting, as I am informed, the
Cathedral of Kirkwall, in the Orkneys, which remained uninjured at the
Reformation; and Andrew Fairservice, who saw with great pride the effect
which it produced upon my mind, thus accounted for its preservation--â€œAh!
itâ€™s a brave kirk--nane oâ€™ yere whig-maleeries and curliewurlies and
opensteek hems about it--aâ€™ solid, weel-jointed mason-wark, that will
stand as lang as the warld, keep hands and gunpowther aff it. It had
amaist a douncome lang syne at the Reformation, when they puâ€™d doun the
kirks of St. Andrews and Perth, and thereawaâ€™, to cleanse them oâ€™ Papery,
and idolatry, and image worship, and surplices, and sic like rags oâ€™ the
muckle hure that sitteth on seven hills, as if ane wasna braid eneugh for
her auld hinder end. Sae the commons oâ€™ Renfrew, and oâ€™ the Barony, and
the Gorbals and aâ€™ about, they behoved to come into Glasgow no fair
morning, to try their hand on purging the High Kirk oâ€™ Popish
nick-nackets. But the townsmen oâ€™ Glasgow, they were feared their auld
edifice might slip the girths in gaun through siccan rough physic, sae
they rang the common bell, and assembled the train-bands wiâ€™ took oâ€™
drum. By good luck, the worthy James Rabat was Dean oâ€™ Guild that
year--(and a gude mason he was himself, made him the keener to keep up
the auld bigging)--and the trades assembled, and offered downright
battle to the commons, rather than their kirk should coup the crans as
others had done elsewhere. It wasna for luve oâ€™ Paperie--na, na!--nane
could ever say that oâ€™ the trades oâ€™ Glasgow--Sae they sune came to an
agreement to take aâ€™ the idolatrous statues of sants (sorrow be on them)
out oâ€™ their neuks--and sae the bits oâ€™ stane idols were broken in
pieces by Scripture warrant, and flung into the Molendinar burn, and the
auld kirk stood as crouse as a cat when the flaes are kaimed aff her,
and aâ€™ body was alike pleased. And I hae heard wise folk say, that if
the same had been done in ilka kirk in Scotland, the Reform wad just hae
been as pure as it is eâ€™en now, and we wad hae mair Christian-like
kirks; for I hae been sae lang in England, that naething will drived out
oâ€™ my head, that the dog-kennel at Osbaldistone Hall is better than mony
a house oâ€™ God in Scotland.â€

Thus saying, Andrew led the way into the place of worship.





CHAPTER THIRD.

                          --It strikes an awe
               And terror on my aching sight; the tombs
               And monumental caves of death look cold,
               And shoot a chillness to the trembling heart.
                                           Mourning Bride.

Notwithstanding the impatience of my conductor, I could not forbear to
pause and gaze for some minutes on the exterior of the building, rendered
more impressively dignified by the solitude which ensued when its
hitherto open gates were closed, after having, as it were, devoured the
multitude which had lately crowded the churchyard, but now, enclosed
within the building, were engaged, as the choral swell of voices from
within announced to us, in the solemn exercises of devotion. The sound of
so many voices united by the distance into one harmony, and freed from
those harsh discordances which jar the ear when heard more near,
combining with the murmuring brook, and the wind which sung among the old
firs, affected me with a sense of sublimity. All nature, as invoked by
the Psalmist whose verses they chanted, seemed united in offering that
solemn praise in which trembling is mixed with joy as she addressed her
Maker. I had heard the service of high mass in France, celebrated with
all the _eâ€™clat_ which the choicest music, the richest dresses, the most
imposing ceremonies, could confer on it; yet it fell short in effect of
the simplicity of the Presbyterian worship. The devotion in which every
one took a share seemed so superior to that which was recited by
musicians as a lesson which they had learned by rote, that it gave the
Scottish worship all the advantage of reality over acting.

As I lingered to catch more of the solemn sound, Andrew, whose impatience
became ungovernable, pulled me by the sleeve--â€œCome awaâ€™, sir--come awaâ€™;
we maunna be late oâ€™ gaun in to disturb the worship; if we bide here the
searchers will be on us, and carry us to the guard-house for being idlers
in kirk-time.â€

Thus admonished, I followed my guide, but not, as I had supposed, into
the body of the cathedral. â€œThis gate--this gate, sir,â€ he exclaimed,
dragging me off as I made towards the main entrance of the
building--â€œThereâ€™s but cauldrife law-work gaun on yonder--carnal
morality, as dowâ€™d and as fusionless as rue leaves at Yule--Hereâ€™s the
real savour of doctrine.â€

So saying, we entered a small low-arched door, secured by a wicket, which
a grave-looking person seemed on the point of closing, and descended
several steps as if into the funeral vaults beneath the church. It was
even so; for in these subterranean precincts,--why chosen for such a
purpose I knew not,--was established a very singular place of worship.

Conceive, Tresham, an extensive range of low-browed, dark, and twilight
vaults, such as are used for sepulchres in other countries, and had long
been dedicated to the same purpose in this, a portion of which was seated
with pews, and used as a church. The part of the vaults thus occupied,
though capable of containing a congregation of many hundreds, bore a
small proportion to the darker and more extensive caverns which yawned
around what may be termed the inhabited space. In those waste regions of
oblivion, dusky banners and tattered escutcheons indicated the graves of
those who were once, doubtless, â€œprinces in Israel.â€ Inscriptions, which
could only be read by the painful antiquary, in language as obsolete as
the act of devotional charity which they employed, invited the passengers
to pray for the souls of those whose bodies rested beneath. Surrounded by
these receptacles of the last remains of mortality, I found a numerous
congregation engaged in the act of prayer. The Scotch perform this duty
in a standing instead of a kneeling posture--more, perhaps, to take as
broad a distinction as possible from the ritual of Rome than for any
better reason; since I have observed, that in their family worship, as
doubtless in their private devotions, they adopt, in their immediate
address to the Deity, that posture which other Christians use as the
humblest and most reverential. Standing, therefore, the men being
uncovered, a crowd of several hundreds of both sexes, and all ages,
listened with great reverence and attention to the extempore, at least
the unwritten, prayer of an aged clergyman, who was very popular in the
city.

Educated in the same religious persuasion, I seriously bent my mind to
join in the devotion of the day; and it was not till the congregation
resumed their seats, that my attention was diverted to the consideration
of the appearance of all around me.

At the conclusion of the prayer, most of the men put on their hats or
bonnets, and all who had the happiness to have seats sate down. Andrew
and I were not of this number, having been too late of entering the
church to secure such accommodation. We stood among a number of other
persons in the same situation, forming a sort of ring around the seated
part of the congregation. Behind and around us were the vaults I have
already described; before us the devout audience, dimly shown by the
light which streamed on their faces through one or two low Gothic
windows, such as give air and light to charnel-houses. By this were seen
the usual variety of countenances which are generally turned towards a
Scotch pastor on such occasions, almost all composed to attention, unless
where a father or mother here and there recalls the wandering eyes of a
lively child, or disturbs the slumbers of a dull one. The high-boned and
harsh countenance of the nation, with the expression of intelligence and
shrewdness which it frequently exhibits, is seen to more advantage in the
act of devotion, or in the ranks of war, than on lighter and more
cheerful occasions of assemblage. The discourse of the preacher was well
qualified to call forth the various feelings and faculties of his
audience.

Age and infirmities had impaired the powers of a voice originally strong
and sonorous. He read his text with a pronunciation somewhat
inarticulate; but when he closed the Bible, and commenced his sermon, his
tones gradually strengthened, as he entered with vehemence into the
arguments which he maintained. They related chiefly to the abstract
points of the Christian faith,--subjects grave, deep, and fathomless by
mere human reason, but for which, with equal ingenuity and propriety, he
sought a key in liberal quotations from the inspired writings. My mind
was unprepared to coincide in all his reasoning, nor was I sure that in
some instances I rightly comprehended his positions. But nothing could be
more impressive than the eager enthusiastic manner of the good old man,
and nothing more ingenious than his mode of reasoning. The Scotch, it is
well known, are more remarkable for the exercise of their intellectual
powers, than for the keenness of their feelings; they are, therefore,
more moved by logic than by rhetoric, and more attracted by acute and
argumentative reasoning on doctrinal points, than influenced by the
enthusiastic appeals to the heart and to the passions, by which popular
preachers in other countries win the favour of their hearers.

Among the attentive group which I now saw, might be distinguished various
expressions similar to those of the audience in the famous cartoon of
Paul preaching at Athens. Here sat a zealous and intelligent Calvinist,
with brows bent just as much as to indicate profound attention; lips
slightly compressed; eyes fixed on the minister with an expression of
decent pride, as if sharing the triumph of his argument; the forefinger
of the right hand touching successively those of the left, as the
preacher, from argument to argument, ascended towards his conclusion.
Another, with fiercer and sterner look, intimated at once his contempt of
all who doubted the creed of his pastor, and his joy at the appropriate
punishment denounced against them. A third, perhaps belonging to a
different congregation, and present only by accident or curiosity, had
the appearance of internally impeaching some link of the reasoning; and
you might plainly read, in the slight motion of his head, his doubts as
to the soundness of the preacherâ€™s argument. The greater part listened
with a calm, satisfied countenance, expressive of a conscious merit in
being present, and in listening to such an ingenious discourse, although
perhaps unable entirely to comprehend it. The women in general belonged
to this last division of the audience; the old, however, seeming more
grimly intent upon the abstract doctrines laid before them; while the
younger females permitted their eyes occasionally to make a modest
circuit around the congregation; and some of them, Tresham (if my vanity
did not greatly deceive me), contrived to distinguish your friend and
servant, as a handsome young stranger and an Englishman. As to the rest
of the congregation, the stupid gaped, yawned, or slept, till awakened by
the application of their more zealous neighboursâ€™ heels to their shins;
and the idle indicated their inattention by the wandering of their eyes,
but dared give no more decided token of weariness. Amid the Lowland
costume of coat and cloak, I could here and there discern a Highland
plaid, the wearer of which, resting on his basket-hilt, sent his eyes
among the audience with the unrestrained curiosity of savage wonder; and
who, in all probability, was inattentive to the sermon for a very
pardonable reason--because he did not understand the language in which it
was delivered. The martial and wild look, however, of these stragglers,
added a kind of character which the congregation could not have exhibited
without them. They were more numerous, Andrew afterwards observed, owing
to some cattle-fair in the neighbourhood.

Such was the group of countenances, rising tier on tier, discovered to my
critical inspection by such sunbeams as forced their way through the
narrow Gothic lattices of the Laigh Kirk of Glasgow; and, having
illuminated the attentive congregation, lost themselves in the vacuity of
the vaults behind, giving to the nearer part of their labyrinth a sort of
imperfect twilight, and leaving their recesses in an utter darkness,
which gave them the appearance of being interminable.

I have already said that I stood with others in the exterior circle, with
my face to the preacher, and my back to those vaults which I have so
often mentioned. My position rendered me particularly obnoxious to any
interruption which arose from any slight noise occurring amongst these
retiring arches, where the least sound was multiplied by a thousand
echoes. The occasional sound of rain-drops, which, admitted through some
cranny in the ruined roof, fell successively, and splashed upon the
pavement beneath, caused me to turn my head more than once to the place
from whence it seemed to proceed, and when my eyes took that direction, I
found it difficult to withdraw them; such is the pleasure our imagination
receives from the attempt to penetrate as far as possible into an
intricate labyrinth, imperfectly lighted, and exhibiting objects which
irritate our curiosity, only because they acquire a mysterious interest
from being undefined and dubious. My eyes became habituated to the gloomy
atmosphere to which I directed them, and insensibly my mind became more
interested in their discoveries than in the metaphysical subtleties which
the preacher was enforcing.

My father had often checked me for this wandering mood of mind, arising
perhaps from an excitability of imagination to which he was a stranger;
and the finding myself at present solicited by these temptations to
inattention, recalled the time when I used to walk, led by his hand, to
Mr. Showerâ€™s chapel, and the earnest injunctions which he then laid on me
to redeem the time, because the days were evil. At present, the picture
which my thoughts suggested, far from fixing my attention, destroyed the
portion I had yet left, by conjuring up to my recollection the peril in
which his affairs now stood. I endeavoured, in the lowest whisper I could
frame, to request Andrew to obtain information, whether any of the
gentlemen of the firm of MacVittie & Co. were at present in the
congregation. But Andrew, wrapped in profound attention to the sermon,
only replied to my suggestion by hard punches with his elbow, as signals
to me to remain silent. I next strained my eyes, with equally bad
success, to see if, among the sea of up-turned faces which bent their
eyes on the pulpit as a common centre, I could discover the sober and
business-like physiognomy of Owen. But not among the broad beavers of the
Glasgow citizens, or the yet broader brimmed Lowland bonnets of the
peasants of Lanarkshire, could I see anything resembling the decent
periwig, starched ruffles, or the uniform suit of light-brown garments
appertaining to the head-clerk of the establishment of Osbaldistone and
Tresham. My anxiety now returned on me with such violence as to overpower
not only the novelty of the scene around me, by which it had hitherto
been diverted, but moreover my sense of decorum. I pulled Andrew hard by
the sleeve, and intimated my wish to leave the church, and pursue my
investigation as I could. Andrew, obdurate in the Laigh Kirk of Glasgow
as on the mountains of Cheviot, for some time deigned me no answer; and
it was only when he found I could not otherwise be kept quiet, that he
condescended to inform me, that, being once in the church, we could not
leave it till service was over, because the doors were locked so soon as
the prayers began. Having thus spoken in a brief and peevish whisper,
Andrew again assumed the air of intelligent and critical importance, and
attention to the preacherâ€™s discourse.

While I endeavoured to make a virtue of necessity, and recall my
attention to the sermon, I was again disturbed by a singular
interruption. A voice from behind whispered distinctly in my ear, â€œYou
are in danger in this city.â€--I turned round, as if mechanically.

One or two starched and ordinary-looking mechanics stood beside and
behind me,--stragglers, who, like ourselves, had been too late in
obtaining entrance. But a glance at their faces satisfied me, though I
could hardly say why, that none of these was the person who had spoken to
me. Their countenances seemed all composed to attention to the sermon,
and not one of them returned any glance of intelligence to the
inquisitive and startled look with which I surveyed them. A massive round
pillar, which was close behind us, might have concealed the speaker the
instant he uttered his mysterious caution; but wherefore it was given in
such a place, or to what species of danger it directed my attention, or
by whom the warning was uttered, were points on which my imagination lost
itself in conjecture. It would, however, I concluded, be repeated, and I
resolved to keep my countenance turned towards the clergyman, that the
whisperer might be tempted to renew his communication under the idea that
the first had passed unobserved.

My plan succeeded. I had not resumed the appearance of attention to the
preacher for five minutes, when the same voice whispered, â€œListen, but do
not look back.â€ I kept my face in the same direction. â€œYou are in danger
in this place,â€ the voice proceeded; â€œso am I--meet me to-night on the
Brigg, at twelve preceesely--keep at home till the gloaming, and avoid
observation.â€

Here the voice ceased, and I instantly turned my head. But the speaker
had, with still greater promptitude, glided behind the pillar, and
escaped my observation. I was determined to catch a sight of him, if
possible, and extricating myself from the outer circle of hearers, I also
stepped behind the column. All there was empty; and I could only see a
figure wrapped in a mantle, whether a Lowland cloak, or Highland plaid, I
could not distinguish, which traversed, like a phantom, the dreary
vacuity of vaults which I have described.

I made a mechanical attempt to pursue the mysterious form, which glided
away and vanished in the vaulted cemetery, like the spectre of one of the
numerous dead who rested within its precincts. I had little chance of
arresting the course of one obviously determined not to be spoken with;
but that little chance was lost by my stumbling and falling before I had
made three steps from the column. The obscurity which occasioned my
misfortune, covered my disgrace; which I accounted rather lucky, for the
preacher, with that stern authority which the Scottish ministers assume
for the purpose of keeping order in their congregations, interrupted his
discourse, to desire the â€œproper officerâ€ to take into custody the causer
of this disturbance in the place of worship. As the noise, however, was
not repeated, the beadle, or whatever else he was called, did not think
it necessary to be rigorous in searching out the offender, so that I was
enabled, without attracting farther observation, to place myself by
Andrewâ€™s side in my original position. The service proceeded, and closed
without the occurrence of anything else worthy of notice.

As the congregation departed and dispersed, my friend Andrew exclaimed,
â€œSee, yonder is worthy Mr. MacVittie, and Mrs. MacVittie, and Miss Alison
MacVittie, and Mr. Thamas MacFin, that they say is to marry Miss Alison,
if aâ€™ bowls row right--sheâ€™ll hae a hantle siller, if sheâ€™s no that
bonny.â€

My eyes took the direction he pointed out. Mr. MacVittie was a tall,
thin, elderly man, with hard features, thick grey eyebrows, light eyes,
and, as I imagined, a sinister expression of countenance, from which my
heart recoiled. I remembered the warning I had received in the church,
and hesitated to address this person, though I could not allege to myself
any rational ground of dislike or suspicion.

I was yet in suspense, when Andrew, who mistook my hesitation for
bashfulness, proceeded to exhort me to lay it aside. â€œSpeak till
him--speak till him, Mr. Francis--heâ€™s no provost yet, though they say
heâ€™ll be my lord neist year. Speak till him, then--heâ€™ll gie ye a decent
answer for as rich as he is, unless ye were wanting siller frae
him--they say heâ€™s dour to draw his purse.â€

It immediately occurred to me, that if this merchant were really of the
churlish and avaricious disposition which Andrew intimated, there might
be some caution necessary in making myself known, as I could not tell how
accounts might stand between my father and him. This consideration came
in aid of the mysterious hint which I had received, and the dislike which
I had conceived at the manâ€™s countenance. Instead of addressing myself
directly to him, as I had designed to have done, I contented myself with
desiring Andrew to inquire at Mr. MacVittieâ€™s house the address of Mr.
Owen, an English gentleman; and I charged him not to mention the person
from whom he received the commission, but to bring me the result to the
small inn where we lodged. This Andrew promised to do. He said something
of the duty of my attending the evening service; but added with a
causticity natural to him, that â€œin troth, if folk couldna keep their
legs still, but wad needs be couping the creels ower through-stanes, as
if they wad raise the very dead folk wiâ€™ the clatter, a kirk wiâ€™ a
chimley inâ€™t was fittest for them.â€





CHAPTER FOURTH.

                 On the Rialto, every night at twelve,
                 I take my eveningâ€™s walk of meditation:
                         There we two will meet.
                                        Venice Preserved.

Full of sinister augury, for which, however, I could assign no
satisfactory cause, I shut myself up in my apartment at the inn, and
having dismissed Andrew, after resisting his importunity to accompany him
to St. Enochâ€™s Kirk, where, he said, â€œa soul-searching divine was to haud
forth,â€ I set myself seriously to consider what were best to be done.

I never was what is properly called superstitious; but I suppose that all
men, in situations of peculiar doubt and difficulty, when they have
exercised their reason to little purpose, are apt, in a sort of despair,
to abandon the reins to their imagination, and be guided altogether by
chance, or by those whimsical impressions which take possession of the
mind, and to which we give way as if to involuntary impulses. There was
something so singularly repulsive in the hard features of the Scotch
trader, that I could not resolve to put myself into his hands without
transgressing every caution which could be derived from the rules of
physiognomy; while, at the same time, the warning voice, the form which
flitted away like a vanishing shadow through those vaults, which might be
termed â€œthe valley of the shadow of death,â€ had something captivating for
the imagination of a young man, who, you will farther please to remember,
was also a young poet.

If danger was around me, as the mysterious communication intimated, how
could I learn its nature, or the means of averting it, but by meeting my
unknown counsellor, to whom I could see no reason for imputing any other
than kind intentions. Rashleigh and his machinations occurred more than
once to my remembrance;--but so rapid had my journey been, that I could
not suppose him apprised of my arrival in Glasgow, much less prepared to
play off any stratagem against my person. In my temper also I was bold
and confident, strong and active in person, and in some measure
accustomed to the use of arms, in which the French youth of all kinds
were then initiated. I did not fear any single opponent; assassination
was neither the vice of the age nor of the country; the place selected
for our meeting was too public to admit any suspicion of meditated
violence. In a word, I resolved to meet my mysterious counsellor on the
bridge, as he had requested, and to be afterwards guided by
circumstances. Let me not conceal from you, Tresham, what at the time I
endeavoured to conceal from myself--the subdued, yet secretly-cherished
hope, that Diana Vernon might--by what chance I knew not--through what
means I could not guess--have some connection with this strange and
dubious intimation conveyed at a time and place, and in a manner so
surprising. She alone--whispered this insidious thought--she alone knew
of my journey; from her own account, she possessed friends and influence
in Scotland; she had furnished me with a talisman, whose power I was to
invoke when all other aid failed me; who then but Diana Vernon possessed
either means, knowledge, or inclination, for averting the dangers, by
which, as it seemed, my steps were surrounded? This flattering view of my
very doubtful case pressed itself upon me again and again. It insinuated
itself into my thoughts, though very bashfully, before the hour of
dinner; it displayed its attractions more boldly during the course of my
frugal meal, and became so courageously intrusive during the succeeding
half-hour (aided perhaps by the flavour of a few glasses of most
excellent claret), that, with a sort of desperate attempt to escape from
a delusive seduction, to which I felt the danger of yielding, I pushed my
glass from me, threw aside my dinner, seized my hat, and rushed into the
open air with the feeling of one who would fly from his own thoughts. Yet
perhaps I yielded to the very feelings from which I seemed to fly, since
my steps insensibly led me to the bridge over the Clyde, the place
assigned for the rendezvous by my mysterious monitor.

Although I had not partaken of my repast until the hours of evening
church-service were over,--in which, by the way, I complied with the
religious scruples of my landlady, who hesitated to dress a hot dinner
between sermons, and also with the admonition of my unknown friend, to
keep my apartment till twilight,--several hours had still to pass away
betwixt the time of my appointment and that at which I reached the
assigned place of meeting. The interval, as you will readily credit, was
wearisome enough; and I can hardly explain to you how it passed away.
Various groups of persons, all of whom, young and old, seemed impressed
with a reverential feeling of the sanctity of the day, passed along the
large open meadow which lies on the northern bank of the Clyde, and
serves at once as a bleaching-field and pleasure-walk for the
inhabitants, or paced with slow steps the long bridge which communicates
with the southern district of the county. All that I remember of them was
the general, yet not unpleasing, intimation of a devotional character
impressed on each little party--formally assumed perhaps by some, but
sincerely characterising the greater number--which hushed the petulant
gaiety of the young into a tone of more quiet, yet more interesting,
interchange of sentiments, and suppressed the vehement argument and
protracted disputes of those of more advanced age. Notwithstanding the
numbers who passed me, no general sound of the human voice was heard; few
turned again to take some minutesâ€™ voluntary exercise, to which the
leisure of the evening, and the beauty of the surrounding scenery, seemed
to invite them: all hurried to their homes and resting-places. To one
accustomed to the mode of spending Sunday evenings abroad, even among the
French Calvinists, there seemed something Judaical, yet, at the same time
striking and affecting, in this mode of keeping the Sabbath holy.
Insensibly I felt my mode of sauntering by the side of the river, and
crossing successively the various persons who were passing homeward, and
without tarrying or delay, must expose me to observation at least, if not
to censure; and I slunk out of the frequented path, and found a trivial
occupation for my mind in marshalling my revolving walk in such a manner
as should least render me obnoxious to observation. The different alleys
lined out through this extensive meadow, and which are planted with
trees, like the Park of St. Jamesâ€™s in London, gave me facilities for
carrying into effect these childish manoeuvres.

As I walked down one of these avenues, I heard, to my surprise, the sharp
and conceited voice of Andrew Fairservice, raised by a sense of
self-consequence to a pitch somewhat higher than others seemed to think
consistent with the solemnity of the day. To slip behind the row of trees
under which I walked was perhaps no very dignified proceeding; but it was
the easiest mode of escaping his observation, and perhaps his impertinent
assiduity, and still more intrusive curiosity. As he passed, I heard him
communicate to a grave-looking man, in a black coat, a slouched hat, and
Geneva cloak, the following sketch of a character, which my self-love,
while revolting against it as a caricature, could not, nevertheless,
refuse to recognise as a likeness.

â€œAy, ay, Mr. Hammorgaw, itâ€™s eâ€™en as I tell ye. Heâ€™s no aâ€™thegither sae
void oâ€™ sense neither; he has a gloaming sight oâ€™ whatâ€™s reasonable--that
is anes and awaâ€™--a glisk and nae mair; but heâ€™s crack-brained and
cockle-headed about his nipperty-tipperty poetry nonsense--Heâ€™ll glowr at
an auld-warld barkit aik-snag as if it were a queezmaddam in full
bearing; and a naked craig, wiâ€™ a bum jawing owerâ€™t, is unto him as a
garden garnisht with flowering knots and choice pot-herbs. Then he wad
rather claver wiâ€™ a daft quean they caâ€™ Diana Vernon (weel I wet they
might caâ€™ her Diana of the Ephesians, for sheâ€™s little better than a
heathen--better? sheâ€™s waur--a Roman, a mere Roman)--heâ€™ll claver wiâ€™
her, or any ither idle slut, rather than hear what might do him gude aâ€™
the days of his life, frae you or me, Mr. Hammorgaw, or ony ither sober
and sponsible person. Reason, sir, is what he canna endure--heâ€™s aâ€™ for
your vanities and volubilities; and he ance tellâ€™d me (puir blinded
creature!) that the Psalms of David were excellent poetry! as if the holy
Psalmist thought oâ€™ rattling rhymes in a blether, like his ain silly
clinkum-clankum things that he caâ€™s verse. Gude help him!--twa lines oâ€™
Davie Lindsay would ding aâ€™ he ever clerkit.â€

While listening to this perverted account of my temper and studies, you
will not be surprised if I meditated for Mr. Fairservice the unpleasant
surprise of a broken pate on the first decent opportunity. His friend
only intimated his attention by â€œAy, ay!â€ and â€œIsâ€™t eâ€™en sae?â€ and
suchlike expressions of interest, at the proper breaks in Mr.
Fairserviceâ€™s harangue, until at length, in answer to some observation of
greater length, the import of which I only collected from my trusty
guideâ€™s reply, honest Andrew answered, â€œTell him a bit oâ€™my mind, quoth
ye? Wha wad be fule then but Andrew? Heâ€™s a red-wad deevil, man--Heâ€™s
like Giles Heathertapâ€™s auld boar;--ye need but shake a clout at him to
make him turn and gore. Bide wiâ€™ him, say ye?--Troth, I kenna what for I
bide wiâ€™ him mysell. But the ladâ€™s no a bad lad after aâ€™; and he needs
some carefuâ€™ body to look after him. He hasna the right grip oâ€™ his
hand--the gowd slips throughâ€™t like water, man; and itâ€™s no that ill a
thing to be near him when his purse is in his hand, and itâ€™s seldom out
oâ€™t. And then heâ€™s come oâ€™ guid kith and kin--My heart warms to the poor
thoughtless callant, Mr. Hammorgaw--and then the penny feeâ€--

In the latter part of this instructive communication, Mr. Fairservice
lowered his voice to a tone better beseeming the conversation in a place
of public resort on a Sabbath evening, and his companion and he were soon
beyond my hearing. My feelings of hasty resentment soon subsided, under
the conviction that, as Andrew himself might have said, â€œA harkener
always hears a bad tale of himself,â€ and that whoever should happen to
overhear their character discussed in their own servantsâ€™-hall, must
prepare to undergo the scalpel of some such anatomist as Mr. Fairservice.
The incident was so far useful, as, including the feelings to which it
gave rise, it sped away a part of the time which hung so heavily on my
hand.

Evening had now closed, and the growing darkness gave to the broad,
still, and deep expanse of the brimful river, first a hue sombre and
uniform--then a dismal and turbid appearance, partially lighted by a
waning and pallid moon. The massive and ancient bridge which stretches
across the Clyde was now but dimly visible, and resembled that which
Mirza, in his unequalled vision, has described as traversing the valley
of Bagdad. The low-browed arches, seen as imperfectly as the dusky
current which they bestrode, seemed rather caverns which swallowed up the
gloomy waters of the river, than apertures contrived for their passage.
With the advancing night the stillness of the scene increased. There was
yet a twinkling light occasionally seen to glide along by the stream,
which conducted home one or two of the small parties, who, after the
abstinence and religious duties of the day, had partaken of a social
supper--the only meal at which the rigid Presbyterians made some advance
to sociality on the Sabbath. Occasionally, also, the hoofs of a horse
were heard, whose rider, after spending the Sunday in Glasgow, was
directing his steps towards his residence in the country. These sounds
and sights became gradually of more rare occurrence; at length they
altogether ceased, and I was left to enjoy my solitary walk on the shores
of the Clyde in solemn silence, broken only by the tolling of the
successive hours from the steeples of the churches.

But as the night advanced my impatience at the uncertainty of the
situation in which I was placed increased every moment, and became nearly
ungovernable. I began to question whether I had been imposed upon by the
trick of a fool, the raving of a madman, or the studied machinations of a
villain, and paced the little quay or pier adjoining the entrance to the
bridge, in a state of incredible anxiety and vexation. At length the hour
of twelve oâ€™clock swung its summons over the city from the belfry of the
metropolitan church of St. Mungo, and was answered and vouched by all the
others like dutiful diocesans. The echoes had scarcely ceased to repeat
the last sound, when a human form--the first I had seen for two
hours--appeared passing along the bridge from the southern shore of the
river. I advanced to meet him with a feeling as if my fate depended on
the result of the interview, so much had my anxiety been wound up by
protracted expectation. All that I could remark of the passenger as we
advanced towards each other, was that his frame was rather beneath than
above the middle size, but apparently strong, thick-set, and muscular;
his dress a horsemanâ€™s wrapping coat. I slackened my pace, and almost
paused as I advanced in expectation that he would address me. But to my
inexpressible disappointment he passed without speaking, and I had no
pretence for being the first to address one who, notwithstanding his
appearance at the very hour of appointment, might nevertheless be an
absolute stranger. I stopped when he had passed me, and looked after
him, uncertain whether I ought not to follow him. The stranger walked on
till near the northern end of the bridge, then paused, looked back, and
turning round, again advanced towards me. I resolved that this time he
should not have the apology for silence proper to apparitions, who, it
is vulgarly supposed, cannot speak until they are spoken to. â€œYou walk
late, sir,â€ said I, as we met a second time.

â€œI bide tryste,â€ was the reply; â€œand so I think do you, Mr.
Osbaldistone.â€

â€œYou are then the person who requested to meet me here at this unusual
hour?â€

â€œI am,â€ he replied. â€œFollow me, and you shall know my reasons.â€

â€œBefore following you, I must know your name and purpose,â€ I answered.

â€œI am a man,â€ was the reply; â€œand my purpose is friendly to you.â€

â€œA man!â€ I repeated;--â€œthat is a very brief description.â€

â€œIt will serve for one who has no other to give,â€ said the stranger. â€œHe
that is without name, without friends, without coin, without country, is
still at least a man; and he that has all these is no more.â€

â€œYet this is still too general an account of yourself, to say the least
of it, to establish your credit with a stranger.â€

â€œIt is all I mean to give, howsoeâ€™er; you may choose to follow me, or to
remain without the information I desire to afford you.â€

â€œCan you not give me that information here?â€ I demanded.

â€œYou must receive it from your eyes, not from my tongue--you must follow
me, or remain in ignorance of the information which I have to give you.â€

There was something short, determined, and even stern, in the manâ€™s
manner, not certainly well calculated to conciliate undoubting
confidence.

â€œWhat is it you fear?â€ he said impatiently. â€œTo whom, think ye, is your
life of such consequence, that they should seek to bereave ye of it?â€

â€œI fear nothing,â€ I replied firmly, though somewhat hastily. â€œWalk on--I
attend you.â€

We proceeded, contrary to my expectation, to re-enter the town, and
glided like mute spectres, side by side, up its empty and silent streets.
The high and gloomy stone fronts, with the variegated ornaments and
pediments of the windows, looked yet taller and more sable by the
imperfect moonshine. Our walk was for some minutes in perfect silence. At
length my conductor spoke.

â€œAre you afraid?â€

â€œI retort your own words,â€ I replied: â€œwherefore should I fear?â€

â€œBecause you are with a stranger--perhaps an enemy, in a place where you
have no friends and many enemies.â€

â€œI neither fear you nor them; I am young, active, and armed.â€

â€œI am not armed,â€ replied my conductor: â€œbut no matter, a willing hand
never lacked weapon. You say you fear nothing; but if you knew who was by
your side, perhaps you might underlie a tremor.â€

â€œAnd why should I?â€ replied I. â€œI again repeat, I fear nought that you
can do.â€

â€œNought that I can do?--Be it so. But do you not fear the consequences of
being found with one whose very name whispered in this lonely street
would make the stones themselves rise up to apprehend him--on whose head
half the men in Glasgow would build their fortune as on a found treasure,
had they the luck to grip him by the collar--the sound of whose
apprehension were as welcome at the Cross of Edinburgh as ever the news
of a field stricken and won in Flanders?â€

â€œAnd who then are you, whose name should create so deep a feeling of
terror?â€ I replied.

â€œNo enemy of yours, since I am conveying you to a place, where, were I
myself recognised and identified, iron to the heels and hemp to the craig
would be my brief dooming.â€

I paused and stood still on the pavement, drawing back so as to have the
most perfect view of my companion which the light afforded me, and which
was sufficient to guard against any sudden motion of assault.

â€œYou have said,â€ I answered, â€œeither too much or too little--too much to
induce me to confide in you as a mere stranger, since you avow yourself a
person amenable to the laws of the country in which we are--and too
little, unless you could show that you are unjustly subjected to their
rigour.â€

As I ceased to speak, he made a step towards me. I drew back
instinctively, and laid my hand on the hilt of my sword.

â€œWhat!â€ said he--â€œon an unarmed man, and your friend?â€

â€œI am yet ignorant if you are either the one or the other,â€ I replied;
â€œand to say the truth, your language and manner might well entitle me to
doubt both.â€

â€œIt is manfully spoken,â€ replied my conductor; â€œand I respect him whose
hand can keep his head.--I will be frank and free with you--I am
conveying you to prison.â€

â€œTo prison!â€ I exclaimed--â€œby what warrant or for what offence?--You
shall have my life sooner than my liberty--I defy you, and I will not
follow you a step farther.â€

â€œI do not,â€ he said, â€œcarry you there as a prisoner; I am,â€ he added,
drawing himself haughtily up, â€œneither a messenger nor sheriffâ€™s officer.
I carry you to see a prisoner from whose lips you will learn the risk in
which you presently stand. Your liberty is little risked by the visit;
mine is in some peril; but that I readily encounter on your account, for
I care not for risk, and I love a free young blood, that kens no
protector but the cross oâ€™ the sword.â€

While he spoke thus, we had reached the principal street, and were
pausing before a large building of hewn stone, garnished, as I thought I
could perceive, with gratings of iron before the windows.

â€œMuckle,â€ said the stranger, whose language became more broadly national
as he assumed a tone of colloquial freedom--â€œMuckle wad the provost and
bailies oâ€™ Glasgow gie to hae him sitting with iron garters to his hose
within their tolbooth that now stands wiâ€™ his legs as free as the
red-deerâ€™s on the outside onâ€™t. And little wad it avail them; for an if
they had me there wiâ€™ a staneâ€™s weight oâ€™ iron at every ankle, I would
show them a toom room and a lost lodger before to-morrow--But come on,
what stint ye for?â€

As he spoke thus, he tapped at a low wicket, and was answered by a sharp
voice, as of one awakened from a dream or reverie,--â€œFaâ€™s tat?--Whaâ€™s
that, I wad say?--and fat a deil want ye at this hour at eâ€™en?--Clean
again rules--clean again rules, as they caâ€™ them.â€

The protracted tone in which the last words were uttered, betokened that
the speaker was again composing himself to slumber. But my guide spoke in
a loud whisper--â€œDougal, man! hae ye forgotten Ha nun Gregarach?â€

â€œDeil a bit, deil a bit,â€ was the ready and lively response, and I heard
the internal guardian of the prison-gate bustle up with great alacrity. A
few words were exchanged between my conductor and the turnkey in a
language to which I was an absolute stranger. The bolts revolved, but
with a caution which marked the apprehension that the noise might be
overheard, and we stood within the vestibule of the prison of Glasgow,--a
small, but strong guard-room, from which a narrow staircase led upwards,
and one or two low entrances conducted to apartments on the same level
with the outward gate, all secured with the jealous strength of wickets,
bolts, and bars. The walls, otherwise naked, were not unsuitably
garnished with iron fetters, and other uncouth implements, which might be
designed for purposes still more inhuman, interspersed with partisans,
guns, pistols of antique manufacture, and other weapons of defence and
offence.

At finding myself so unexpectedly, fortuitously, and, as it were, by
stealth, introduced within one of the legal fortresses of Scotland, I
could not help recollecting my adventure in Northumberland, and fretting
at the strange incidents which again, without any demerits of my own,
threatened to place me in a dangerous and disagreeable collision with the
laws of a country which I visited only in the capacity of a stranger.





CHAPTER FIFTH.


            Look round thee, young Astolpho: Hereâ€™s the place
            Which men (for being poor) are sent to starve in;
                Rude remedy, I trow, for sore disease.
            Within these walls, stifled by damp and stench,
            Doth Hopeâ€™s fair torch expire; and at the snuff,
            Ere yet â€˜tis quite extinct, rude, wild, and way-ward,
                The desperate revelries of wild despair,
            Kindling their hell-born cressets, light to deeds
            That the poor captive would have died ere practised,
                Till bondage sunk his soul to his condition.
                                  The Prison, _Scene III. Act I._

At my first entrance I turned an eager glance towards my conductor; but
the lamp in the vestibule was too low in flame to give my curiosity any
satisfaction by affording a distinct perusal of his features. As the
turnkey held the light in his hand, the beams fell more full on his own
scarce less interesting figure. He was a wild shock-headed looking
animal, whose profusion of red hair covered and obscured his features,
which were otherwise only characterised by the extravagant joy that
affected him at the sight of my guide. In my experience I have met
nothing so absolutely resembling my idea of a very uncouth, wild, and
ugly savage, adoring the idol of his tribe. He grinned, he shivered, he
laughed, he was near crying, if he did not actually cry. He had a â€œWhere
shall I go?--What can I do for you?â€ expression of face; the complete,
surrendered, and anxious subservience and devotion of which it is
difficult to describe, otherwise than by the awkward combination which I
have attempted. The fellowâ€™s voice seemed choking in his ecstasy, and
only could express itself in such interjections as â€œOigh! oigh!--Ay!
ay!--itâ€™s lang since sheâ€™s seen ye!â€ and other exclamations equally brief,
expressed in the same unknown tongue in which he had communicated with my
conductor while we were on the outside of the jail door. My guide
received all this excess of joyful gratulation much like a prince too
early accustomed to the homage of those around him to be much moved by
it, yet willing to requite it by the usual forms of royal courtesy. He
extended his hand graciously towards the turnkey, with a civil inquiry of
â€œHowâ€™s aâ€™ wiâ€™ you, Dougal?â€

â€œOigh! oigh!â€ exclaimed Dougal, softening the sharp exclamations of his
surprise as he looked around with an eye of watchful alarm--â€œOigh! to see
you here--to see you here!--Oigh!--what will come oâ€™ ye gin the bailies
suld come to get witting--ta filthy, gutty hallions, tat they are?â€

My guide placed his finger on his lip, and said, â€œFear nothing, Dougal;
your hands shall never draw a bolt on me.â€

â€œTat sall they no,â€ said Dougal; â€œshe suld--she wad--that is, she wishes
them hacked aff by the elbows first--But when are ye gaun yonder again?
and yeâ€™ll no forget to let her ken--sheâ€™s your puir cousin, God kens,
only seven times removed.â€

â€œI will let you ken, Dougal, as soon as my plans are settled.â€

â€œAnd, by her sooth, when you do, an it were twal oâ€™ the Sunday at eâ€™en,
sheâ€™ll fling her keys at the provostâ€™s head or she gie them anither turn,
and that or ever Monday morning begins--see if she winna.â€

My mysterious stranger cut his acquaintanceâ€™s ecstasies short by again
addressing him, in what I afterwards understood to be the Irish, Earse,
or Gaelic, explaining, probably, the services which he required at his
hand. The answer, â€œWiâ€™ aâ€™ her heart--wiâ€™ aâ€™ her soul,â€ with a good deal
of indistinct muttering in a similar tone, intimated the turnkeyâ€™s
acquiescence in what he proposed. The fellow trimmed his dying lamp, and
made a sign to me to follow him.

â€œDo you not go with us?â€ said I, looking to my conductor.

â€œIt is unnecessary,â€ he replied; â€œmy company may be inconvenient for you,
and I had better remain to secure our retreat.â€

â€œI do not suppose you mean to betray me to danger,â€ said I.

â€œTo none but what I partake in doubly,â€ answered the stranger, with a
voice of assurance which it was impossible to mistrust.

I followed the turnkey, who, leaving the inner wicket unlocked behind
him, led me up a _turnpike_ (so the Scotch call a winding stair), then
along a narrow gallery--then opening one of several doors which led into
the passage, he ushered me into a small apartment, and casting his eye on
the pallet-bed which occupied one corner, said with an under voice, as he
placed the lamp on a little deal table, â€œSheâ€™s sleeping.â€

â€œShe!--who?--can it be Diana Vernon in this abode of misery?â€

I turned my eye to the bed, and it was with a mixture of disappointment
oddly mingled with pleasure, that I saw my first suspicion had deceived
me. I saw a head neither young nor beautiful, garnished with a grey beard
of two daysâ€™ growth, and accommodated with a red nightcap. The first
glance put me at ease on the score of Diana Vernon; the second, as the
slumberer awoke from a heavy sleep, yawned, and rubbed his eyes,
presented me with features very different indeed--even those of my poor
friend Owen. I drew back out of view an instant, that he might have time
to recover himself; fortunately recollecting that I was but an intruder
on these cells of sorrow, and that any alarm might be attended with
unhappy consequences.

Meantime, the unfortunate formalist, raising himself from the pallet-bed
with the assistance of one hand, and scratching his cap with the other,
exclaimed in a voice in which as much peevishness as he was capable of
feeling, contended with drowsiness, â€œIâ€™ll tell you what, Mr. Dug-well, or
whatever your name may be, the sum-total of the matter is, that if my
natural rest is to be broken in this manner, I must complain to the lord
mayor.â€

â€œShentlemans to speak wiâ€™ her,â€ replied Dougal, resuming the true dogged
sullen tone of a turnkey, in exchange for the shrill clang of Highland
congratulation with which he had welcomed my mysterious guide; and,
turning on his heel, he left the apartment.

It was some time before I could prevail upon the unfortunate sleeper
awakening to recognise me; and when he did so, the distress of the worthy
creature was extreme, at supposing, which he naturally did, that I had
been sent thither as a partner of his captivity.

â€œO, Mr. Frank, what have you brought yourself and the house to?--I think
nothing of myself, that am a mere cipher, so to speak; but you, that was
your fatherâ€™s sum-total--his omnium,--you that might have been the first
man in the first house in the first city, to be shut up in a nasty Scotch
jail, where one cannot even get the dirt brushed off their clothes!â€

He rubbed, with an air of peevish irritation, the once stainless brown
coat, which had now shared some of the impurities of the floor of his
prison-house,--his habits of extreme punctilious neatness acting
mechanically to increase his distress.--â€œO Heaven be gracious to us!â€ he
continued. â€œWhat news this will be on â€˜Change! There has not the like
come there since the battle of Almanza, where the total of the British
loss was summed up to five thousand men killed and wounded, besides a
floating balance of missing--but what will that be to the news that
Osbaldistone and Tresham have stopped!â€

I broke in on his lamentations to acquaint him that I was no prisoner,
though scarce able to account for my being in that place at such an hour.
I could only silence his inquiries by persisting in those which his own
situation suggested; and at length obtained from him such information as
he was able to give me. It was none of the most distinct; for, however
clear-headed in his own routine of commercial business, Owen, you are
well aware, was not very acute in comprehending what lay beyond that
sphere.

The sum of his information was, that of two correspondents of my fatherâ€™s
firm at Glasgow, where, owing to engagements in Scotland formerly alluded
to, he transacted a great deal of business, both my father and Owen had
found the house of MacVittie, MacFin, and Company, the most obliging and
accommodating. They had deferred to the great English house on every
possible occasion; and in their bargains and transactions acted, without
repining, the part of the jackall, who only claims what the lion is
pleased to leave him. However small the share of profit allotted to them,
it was always, as they expressed it, â€œenough for the like of them;â€
 however large the portion of trouble, â€œthey were sensible they could not
do too much to deserve the continued patronage and good opinion of their
honoured friends in Crane Alley.â€

The dictates of my father were to MacVittie and MacFin the laws of the
Medes and Persians, not to be altered, innovated, or even discussed; and
the punctilios exacted by Owen in their business transactions, for he was
a great lover of form, more especially when he could dictate it _ex
cathedra,_ seemed scarce less sanctimonious in their eyes. This tone of
deep and respectful observance went all currently down with Owen; but my
father looked a little closer into menâ€™s bosoms, and whether suspicious
of this excess of deference, or, as a lover of brevity and simplicity in
business, tired with these gentlemenâ€™s long-winded professions of regard,
he had uniformly resisted their desire to become his sole agents in
Scotland. On the contrary, he transacted many affairs through a
correspondent of a character perfectly different--a man whose good
opinion of himself amounted to self-conceit, and who, disliking the
English in general as much as my father did the Scotch, would hold no
communication but on a footing of absolute equality; jealous, moreover;
captious occasionally; as tenacious of his own opinions in point of form
as Owen could be of his; and totally indifferent though the authority of
all Lombard Street had stood against his own private opinion.

As these peculiarities of temper rendered it difficult to transact
business with Mr. Nicol Jarvie,--as they occasioned at times disputes and
coldness between the English house and their correspondent, which were
only got over by a sense of mutual interest,--as, moreover, Owenâ€™s
personal vanity sometimes suffered a little in the discussions to which
they gave rise, you cannot be surprised, Tresham, that our old friend
threw at all times the weight of his influence in favour of the civil,
discreet, accommodating concern of MacVittie and MacFin, and spoke of
Jarvie as a petulant, conceited Scotch pedlar, with whom there was no
dealing.

It was also not surprising, that in these circumstances, which I only
learned in detail some time afterwards, Owen, in the difficulties to
which the house was reduced by the absence of my father, and the
disappearance of Rashleigh, should, on his arrival in Scotland, which
took place two days before mine, have recourse to the friendship of those
correspondents, who had always professed themselves obliged, gratified,
and devoted to the service of his principal. He was received at Messrs.
MacVittie and MacFinâ€™s counting-house in the Gallowgate, with something
like the devotion a Catholic would pay to his tutelar saint. But, alas!
this sunshine was soon overclouded, when, encouraged by the fair hopes
which it inspired, he opened the difficulties of the house to his
friendly correspondents, and requested their counsel and assistance.
MacVittie was almost stunned by the communication; and MacFin, ere it was
completed, was already at the ledger of their firm, and deeply engaged in
the very bowels of the multitudinous accounts between their house and
that of Osbaldistone and Tresham, for the purpose of discovering on which
side the balance lay. Alas! the scale depressed considerably against the
English firm; and the faces of MacVittie and MacFin, hitherto only blank
and doubtful, became now ominous, grim, and lowering. They met Mr. Owenâ€™s
request of countenance and assistance with a counter-demand of instant
security against imminent hazard of eventual loss; and at length,
speaking more plainly, required that a deposit of assets, destined for
other purposes, should be placed in their hands for that purpose. Owen
repelled this demand with great indignation, as dishonourable to his
constituents, unjust to the other creditors of Osbaldistone and Tresham,
and very ungrateful on the part of those by whom it was made.

The Scotch partners gained, in the course of this controversy, what is
very convenient to persons who are in the wrong, an opportunity and
pretext for putting themselves in a violent passion, and for taking,
under the pretext of the provocation they had received, measures to which
some sense of decency, if not of conscience, might otherwise have
deterred them from resorting.

Owen had a small share, as I believe is usual, in the house to which he
acted as head-clerk, and was therefore personally liable for all its
obligations. This was known to Messrs. MacVittie and MacFin; and, with a
view of making him feel their power, or rather in order to force him, at
this emergency, into those measures in their favour, to which he had
expressed himself so repugnant, they had recourse to a summary process of
arrest and imprisonment,--which it seems the law of Scotland (therein
surely liable to much abuse) allows to a creditor, who finds his
conscience at liberty to make oath that the debtor meditates departing
from the realm. Under such a warrant had poor Owen been confined to
durance on the day preceding that when I was so strangely guided to his
prison-house.

Thus possessed of the alarming outline of facts, the question remained,
what was to be done and it was not of easy determination. I plainly
perceived the perils with which we were surrounded, but it was more
difficult to suggest any remedy. The warning which I had already received
seemed to intimate, that my own personal liberty might be endangered by
an open appearance in Owenâ€™s behalf. Owen entertained the same
apprehension, and, in the exaggeration of his terror, assured me that a
Scotchman, rather than run the risk of losing a farthing by an
Englishman, would find law for arresting his wife, children, man-servant,
maidservant, and stranger within his household. The laws concerning debt,
in most countries, are so unmercifully severe, that I could not
altogether disbelieve his statement; and my arrest, in the present
circumstances, would have been a _coup-de-grace_ to my fatherâ€™s affairs.
In this dilemma, I asked Owen if he had not thought of having recourse to
my fatherâ€™s other correspondent in Glasgow, Mr. Nicol Jarvie?

â€œHe had sent him a letter,â€ he replied, â€œthat morning; but if the
smooth-tongued and civil house in the Gallowgate had used him thus, what
was to be expected from the cross-grained crab-stock in the Salt-Market?

You might as well ask a broker to give up his percentage, as expect a
favour from him without the _per contra._ He had not even,â€ Owen said,
â€œanswered his letter though it was put into his hand that morning as he
went to church.â€ And here the despairing man-of-figures threw himself
down on his pallet, exclaiming,--â€œMy poor dear master! My poor dear
master! O Mr. Frank, Mr. Frank, this is all your obstinacy!--But God
forgive me for saying so to you in your distress! Itâ€™s Godâ€™s disposing,
and man must submit.â€

My philosophy, Tresham, could not prevent my sharing in the honest
creatureâ€™s distress, and we mingled our tears,--the more bitter on my
part, as the perverse opposition to my fatherâ€™s will, with which the
kind-hearted Owen forbore to upbraid me, rose up to my conscience as the
cause of all this affliction.

In the midst of our mingled sorrow, we were disturbed and surprised by a
loud knocking at the outward door of the prison. I ran to the top of the
staircase to listen, but could only hear the voice of the turnkey,
alternately in a high tone, answering to some person without, and in a
whisper, addressed to the person who had guided me hither--â€œSheâ€™s
coming--sheâ€™s coming,â€ aloud; then in a low key, â€œO hon-a-ri! O hon-a-ri!
whatâ€™ll she do now?--Gang up ta stair, and hide yourself ahint ta
Sassenach shentlemanâ€™s ped.--Sheâ€™s coming as fast as she can.--Ahellanay!
itâ€™s my lord provosts, and ta pailies, and ta guard--and ta captainâ€™s
coming toon stairs too--Got press her! gang up or he meets her.--Sheâ€™s
coming--sheâ€™s coming--ta lockâ€™s sair roosted.â€

While Dougal, unwillingly, and with as much delay as possible, undid the
various fastenings to give admittance to those without, whose impatience
became clamorous, my guide ascended the winding stair, and sprang into
Owenâ€™s apartment, into which I followed him. He cast his eyes hastily
round, as if looking for a place of concealment; then said to me, â€œLend
me your pistols--yet itâ€™s no matter, I can do without them--Whatever you
see, take no heed, and do not mix your hand in another manâ€™s feud--This
gearâ€™s mine, and I must manage it as I dow; but I have been as hard
bested, and worse, than I am even now.â€

As the stranger spoke these words, he stripped from his person the
cumbrous upper coat in which he was wrapt, confronted the door of the
apartment, on which he fixed a keen and determined glance, drawing his
person a little back to concentrate his force, like a fine horse brought
up to the leaping-bar. I had not a momentâ€™s doubt that he meant to
extricate himself from his embarrassment, whatever might be the cause of
it, by springing full upon those who should appear when the doors opened,
and forcing his way through all opposition into the street;--and such was
the appearance of strength and agility displayed in his frame, and of
determination in his look and manner, that I did not doubt a moment but
that he might get clear through his opponents, unless they employed fatal
means to stop his purpose. It was a period of awful suspense betwixt the
opening of the outward gate and that of the door of the apartment, when
there appeared--no guard with bayonets fixed, or watch with clubs, bills,
or partisans, but a good-looking young woman, with grogram petticoats,
tucked up for trudging through the streets, and holding a lantern in her
hand. This female ushered in a more important personage, in form, stout,
short, and somewhat corpulent; and by dignity, as it soon appeared, a
magistrate, bob-wigged, bustling, and breathless with peevish impatience.
My conductor, at his appearance, drew back as if to escape observation;
but he could not elude the penetrating twinkle with which this dignitary
reconnoitered the whole apartment.

â€œA bonny thing it is, and a beseeming, that I should be kept at the door
half an hour, Captain Stanchells,â€ said he, addressing the principal
jailor, who now showed himself at the door as if in attendance on the
great man, â€œknocking as hard to get into the tolbooth as onybody else wad
to get out of it, could that avail them, poor fallen creatures!--And
howâ€™s this?--howâ€™s this?--strangers in the jail after lock-up hours, and
on the Sabbath evening!--I shall look after this, Stanchells, you may
depend onâ€™t--Keep the door locked, and Iâ€™ll speak to these gentlemen in a
gliffing--But first I maun hae a crack wiâ€™ an auld acquaintance here.--
Mr. Owen, Mr. Owen, howâ€™s aâ€™ wiâ€™ ye, man?â€

â€œPretty well in body, I thank you, Mr. Jarvie,â€ drawled out poor Owen,
â€œbut sore afflicted in spirit.â€

â€œNae doubt, nae doubt--ay, ay--itâ€™s an awfuâ€™ whummle--and for ane that
held his head sae high too--human nature, human nature--Ay ay, weâ€™re aâ€™
subject to a downcome. Mr. Osbaldistone is a gude honest gentleman; but I
aye said he was ane oâ€™ them wad make a spune or spoil a horn, as my
father the worthy deacon used to say. The deacon used to say to me,
â€˜Nick--young Nickâ€™ (his name was Nicol as weel as mine; sae folk caâ€™d us
in their daffinâ€™, young Nick and auld Nick)--â€˜Nick,â€™ said he, â€˜never put
out your arm farther than ye can draw it easily back again.â€™ I hae said
sae to Mr. Osbaldistone, and he didna seem to take it aâ€™thegither sae
kind as I wished--but it was weel meant--weel meant.â€

This discourse, delivered with prodigious volubility, and a great
appearance of self-complacency, as he recollected his own advice and
predictions, gave little promise of assistance at the hands of Mr.
Jarvie. Yet it soon appeared rather to proceed from a total want of
delicacy than any deficiency of real kindness; for when Owen expressed
himself somewhat hurt that these things should be recalled to memory in
his present situation, the Glaswegian took him by the hand, and bade him
â€œCheer up a gliff! Dâ€™ye think I wad hae comed out at twal oâ€™clock at
night, and amaist broken the Lordâ€™s day, just to tell a faâ€™en man oâ€™ his
backslidings? Na, na, thatâ€™s no Bailie Jarvieâ€™s gate, nor wasâ€™t his
worthy fatherâ€™s the deacon afore him. Why, man! itâ€™s my rule never to
think on warldly business on the Sabbath, and though I did aâ€™ I could to
keep your note that I gat this morning out oâ€™ my head, yet I thought mair
on it aâ€™ day, than on the preaching--And itâ€™s my rule to gang to my bed
wiâ€™ the yellow curtains preceesely at ten oâ€™clock--unless I were eating a
haddock wiâ€™ a neighbour, or a neighbour wiâ€™ me--ask the lass-quean there,
if it isna a fundamental rule in my household; and here hae I sitten up
reading gude books, and gaping as if I wad swallow St. Enox Kirk, till it
chappit twal, whilk was a lawfuâ€™ hour to gie a look at my ledger, just to
see how things stood between us; and then, as time and tide wait for no
man, I made the lass get the lantern, and came slipping my ways here to
see what can be dune anent your affairs. Bailie Jarvie can command
entrance into the tolbooth at ony hour, day or night;--sae could my
father the deacon in his time, honest man, praise to his memory.â€

Although Owen groaned at the mention of the ledger, leading me grievously
to fear that here also the balance stood in the wrong column; and
although the worthy magistrateâ€™s speech expressed much self-complacency,
and some ominous triumph in his own superior judgment, yet it was blended
with a sort of frank and blunt good-nature, from which I could not help
deriving some hopes. He requested to see some papers he mentioned,
snatched them hastily from Owenâ€™s hand, and sitting on the bed, to â€œrest
his shanks,â€ as he was pleased to express the accommodation which that
posture afforded him, his servant girl held up the lantern to him, while,
pshawing, muttering, and sputtering, now at the imperfect light, now at
the contents of the packet, he ran over the writings it contained.

Seeing him fairly engaged in this course of study, the guide who had
brought me hither seemed disposed to take an unceremonious leave. He made
a sign to me to say nothing, and intimated, by his change of posture, an
intention to glide towards the door in such a manner as to attract the
least possible observation. But the alert magistrate (very different from
my old acquaintance, Mr. Justice Inglewood) instantly detected and
interrupted his purposes. â€œI say, look to the door, Stanchells--shut and
lock it, and keep watch on the outside.â€

The strangerâ€™s brow darkened, and he seemed for an instant again to
meditate the effecting his retreat by violence; but ere he had
determined, the door closed, and the ponderous bolt revolved. He muttered
an exclamation in Gaelic, strode across the floor, and then, with an air
of dogged resolution, as if fixed and prepared to see the scene to an
end, sate himself down on the oak table, and whistled a strathspey.

Mr. Jarvie, who seemed very alert and expeditious in going through
business, soon showed himself master of that which he had been
considering, and addressed himself to Mr. Owen in the following strain:--
â€œWeel, Mr. Owen, weel--your house are awinâ€™ certain sums to Messrs.
MacVittie and MacFin (shame faâ€™ their souple snouts! they made that and
mair out oâ€™ a bargain about the aik-woods at Glen-Cailziechat, that they
took out atween my teeth--wiâ€™ help oâ€™ your gude word, I maun needs say,
Mr. Owen--but that makes nae odds now)--Weel, sir, your house awes them
this siller; and for this, and relief of other engagements they stand in
for you, they hae putten a double turn oâ€™ Stanchellsâ€™ muckle key on ye.--
Weel, sir, ye awe this siller--and maybe ye awe some mair to some other
body too--maybe ye awe some to myself, Bailie Nicol Jarvie.â€

â€œI cannot deny, sir, but the balance may of this date be brought out
against us, Mr. Jarvie,â€ said Owen; â€œbut youâ€™ll please to considerâ€--

â€œI hae nae time to consider eâ€™enow, Mr. Owen--Sae near Sabbath at eâ€™en,
and out oâ€™ aneâ€™s warm bed at this time oâ€™ night, and a sort oâ€™ drow in
the air besides--thereâ€™s nae time for considering--But, sir, as I was
saying, ye awe me money--it winna deny--ye awe me money, less or mair,
Iâ€™ll stand by it. But then, Mr. Owen, I canna see how you, an active man
that understands business, can redd out the business yeâ€™re come down
about, and clear us aâ€™ aff--as I have gritt hope ye will--if yeâ€™re keepit
lying here in the tolbooth of Glasgow. Now, sir, if you can find caution
_judicio sisti,_--that is, that ye winna flee the country, but appear and
relieve your caution when caâ€™d for in our legal courts, ye may be set at
liberty this very morning.â€

â€œMr. Jarvie,â€ said Owen, â€œif any friend would become surety for me to
that effect, my liberty might be usefully employed, doubtless, both for
the house and all connected with it.â€

â€œAweel, sir,â€ continued Jarvie, â€œand doubtless such a friend wad expect
ye to appear when caâ€™d on, and relieve him oâ€™ his engagement.â€

â€œAnd I should do so as certainly, bating sickness or death, as that two
and two make four.â€

â€œAweel, Mr. Owen,â€ resumed the citizen of Glasgow, â€œI dinna misdoubt ye,
and Iâ€™ll prove it, sir--Iâ€™ll prove it. I am a carefuâ€™ man, as is weel
kenâ€™d, and industrious, as the hale town can testify; and I can win my
crowns, and keep my crowns, and count my crowns, wiâ€™ onybody in the Saut
Market, or it may be in the Gallowgate. And Iâ€™m a prudent man, as my
father the deacon was before me;--but rather than an honest civil
gentleman, that understands business, and is willing to do justice to all
men, should lie by the heels this gate, unable to help himsell or onybody
else--why, conscience, man! Iâ€™ll be your bail myself--But yeâ€™ll mind itâ€™s
a bail _judicio sisti,_ as our town-clerk says, not _judicatum solvi;_
yeâ€™ll mind that, for thereâ€™s muckle difference.â€

Mr. Owen assured him, that as matters then stood, he could not expect any
one to become surety for the actual payment of the debt, but that there
was not the most distant cause for apprehending loss from his failing to
present himself when lawfully called upon.

â€œI believe ye--I believe ye. Eneugh said--eneugh said. Weâ€™se hae your
legs loose by breakfast-time.--And now letâ€™s hear what thir chamber
chiels oâ€™ yours hae to say for themselves, or how, in the name of unrule,
they got here at this time oâ€™ night.â€




CHAPTER SIXTH.

                        Hame came our gudeman at eâ€™en,
                           And hame came he,
                        And there he saw a man
                           Where a man suldna be.
                       â€œHowâ€™s this now, kimmer?
                           Howâ€™s this?â€ quo he,--
                       â€œHow came this carle here
                           Without the leave oâ€™ me?â€
                                            Old Song.

The magistrate took the light out of the servant-maidâ€™s hand, and
advanced to his scrutiny, like Diogenes in the street of Athens,
lantern-in-hand, and probably with as little expectation as that of the
cynic, that he was likely to encounter any especial treasure in the
course of his researches. The first whom he approached was my mysterious
guide, who, seated on a table as I have already described him, with his
eyes firmly fixed on the wall, his features arranged into the utmost
inflexibility of expression, his hands folded on his breast with an air
betwixt carelessness and defiance, his heel patting against the foot of
the table, to keep time with the tune which he continued to whistle,
submitted to Mr. Jarvieâ€™s investigation with an air of absolute
confidence and assurance which, for a moment, placed at fault the memory
and sagacity of the acute investigator.

â€œAh!--Eh!--Oh!â€ exclaimed the Bailie. â€œMy conscience!--itâ€™s
impossible!--and yet--no!--Conscience!--it canna be!--and yet
again--Deil hae me, that I suld say sae!--Ye robber--ye cateran--ye born
deevil that ye are, to aâ€™ bad ends and nae gude ane!--can this be you?â€

â€œEâ€™en as ye see, Bailie,â€ was the laconic answer.

â€œConscience! if I am na clean bumbaized--_you_, ye cheat-the-wuddy
rogue--_you_ here on your venture in the tolbooth oâ€™ Glasgow?--What dâ€™ye
thinkâ€™s the value oâ€™ your head?â€

â€œUmph!--why, fairly weighed, and Dutch weight, it might weigh down one
provostâ€™s, four bailiesâ€™, a town-clerkâ€™s, six deaconsâ€™, besides
stent-mastersâ€™â€--

â€œAh, ye reiving villain!â€ interrupted Mr. Jarvie. â€œBut tell ower your
sins, and prepare ye, for if I say the wordâ€--

â€œTrue, Bailie,â€ said he who was thus addressed, folding his hands behind
him with the utmost _nonchalance,_ â€œbut ye will never say that word.â€

â€œAnd why suld I not, sir?â€ exclaimed the magistrate--â€œWhy suld I not?
Answer me that--why suld I not?â€

â€œFor three sufficient reasons, Bailie Jarvie.--First, for auld langsyne;
second, for the sake of the auld wife ayont the fire at Stuckavrallachan,
that made some mixture of our bluids, to my own proper shame be it
spoken! that has a cousin wiâ€™ accounts, and yarn winnles, and looms and
shuttles, like a mere mechanical person; and lastly, Bailie, because if I
saw a sign oâ€™ your betraying me, I would plaster that waâ€™ with your harns
ere the hand of man could rescue you!â€

â€œYeâ€™re a bauld desperate villain, sir,â€ retorted the undaunted Bailie;
â€œand ye ken that I ken ye to be sae, and that I wadna stand a moment for
my ain risk.â€

â€œI ken weel,â€ said the other, â€œye hae gentle bluid in your veins, and I
wad be laith to hurt my ain kinsman. But Iâ€™ll gang out here as free as I
came in, or the very waâ€™s oâ€™ Glasgow tolbooth shall tell oâ€™t these ten
years to come.â€

â€œWeel, weel,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, â€œbluidâ€™s thicker than water; and it liesna
in kith, kin, and ally, to see motes in ilka otherâ€™s een if other een see
them no. It wad be sair news to the auld wife below the Ben of
Stuckavrallachan, that you, ye Hieland limmer, had knockit out my harns,
or that I had kilted you up in a tow. But yeâ€™ll own, ye dour deevil, that
were it no your very sell, I wad hae grippit the best man in the
Hielands.â€

â€œYe wad hae tried, cousin,â€ answered my guide, â€œthat I wot weel; but I
doubt ye wad hae come aff wiâ€™ the short measure; for we gang-there-out
Hieland bodies are an unchancy generation when you speak to us oâ€™
bondage. We downa bide the coercion of gude braid-claith about our
hinderlans, let a be breeks oâ€™ free-stone, and garters oâ€™ iron.â€

â€œYeâ€™ll find the stane breeks and the airn garters--ay, and the hemp
cravat, for aâ€™ that, neighbour,â€ replied the Bailie.

â€œNae man in a civilised country ever played the pliskies ye hae done--but
eâ€™en pickle in your ain pock-neuk--I hae giâ€™en ye wanting.â€

â€œWell, cousin,â€ said the other, â€œyeâ€™ll wear black at my burial.â€

â€œDeil a black cloak will be there, Robin, but the corbies and the
hoodie-craws, Iâ€™se gie ye my hand on that. But wharâ€™s the gude thousand
pund Scots that I lent ye, man, and when am I to see it again?â€

â€œWhere it is,â€ replied my guide, after the affectation of considering for
a moment, â€œI cannot justly tell--probably where last yearâ€™s snaw is.â€

â€œAnd thatâ€™s on the tap of Schehallion, ye Hieland dog,â€ said Mr. Jarvie;
â€œand I look for payment frae you where ye stand.â€

â€œAy,â€ replied the Highlander, â€œbut I keep neither snaw nor dollars in my
sporran. And as to when youâ€™ll see it--why, just when the king enjoys his
ain again, as the auld sang says.â€

â€œWarst of aâ€™, Robin,â€ retorted the Glaswegian,--â€œI mean, ye disloyal
traitor--Warst of aâ€™!--Wad ye bring popery in on us, and arbitrary power,
and a foist and a warming-pan, and the set forms, and the curates, and
the auld enormities oâ€™ surplices and cerements? Ye had better stick
to your auld trade oâ€™ theft-boot, black-mail, spreaghs, and
gillravaging--better stealing nowte than ruining nations.â€

â€œHout, man--whisht wiâ€™ your whiggery,â€ answered the Celt; â€œwe hae kenâ€™d
ane anither mony a lang day. Iâ€™se take care your counting-room is no
cleaned out when the Gillon-a-naillie come to redd up the Glasgow
buiths, and clear them oâ€™ their auld shop-wares.

And, unless it just faâ€™ in the preceese way oâ€™ your duty, ye maunna see
me oftener, Nicol, than I am disposed to be seen.â€

â€œYe are a dauring villain, Rob,â€ answered the Bailie; â€œand ye will be
hanged, that will be seen and heard tell oâ€™; but Iâ€™se neâ€™er be the ill
bird and foul my nest, set apart strong necessity and the skreigh of
duty, which no man should hear and be inobedient. And wha the deevilâ€™s
this?â€ he continued, turning to me--â€œSome gillravager that ye hae listed,
I daur say. He looks as if he had a bauld heart to the highway, and a
lang craig for the gibbet.â€

â€œThis, good Mr. Jarvie,â€ said Owen, who, like myself, had been struck
dumb during this strange recognition, and no less strange dialogue, which
took place betwixt these extraordinary kinsmen--â€œThis, good Mr. Jarvie,
is young Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, only child of the head of our house, who
should have been taken into our firm at the time Mr. Rashleigh
Osbaldistone, his cousin, had the luck to be taken into itâ€--(Here Owen
could not suppress a groan)--â€œBut howsoeverâ€--

â€œOh, I have heard of that smaik,â€ said the Scotch merchant, interrupting
him; â€œit is he whom your principal, like an obstinate auld fule, wad make
a merchant oâ€™, wad he or wad he no,--and the lad turned a strolling
stage-player, in pure dislike to the labour an honest man should live by.
Weel, sir, what say you to your handiwork? Will Hamlet the Dane, or
Hamletâ€™s ghost, be good security for Mr. Owen, sir?â€

â€œI donâ€™t deserve your taunt,â€ I replied, â€œthough I respect your motive,
and am too grateful for the assistance you have afforded Mr. Owen, to
resent it. My only business here was to do what I could (it is perhaps
very little) to aid Mr. Owen in the management of my fatherâ€™s affairs. My
dislike of the commercial profession is a feeling of which I am the best
and sole judge.â€

â€œI protest,â€ said the Highlander, â€œI had some respect for this callant
even before I kenâ€™d what was in him; but now I honour him for his
contempt of weavers and spinners, and sic-like mechanical persons and
their pursuits.â€

â€œYeâ€™re mad, Rob,â€ said the Bailie--â€œmad as a March hare--though wherefore
a hare suld be mad at March mair than at Martinmas, is mair than I can
weel say. Weavers! Deil shake ye out oâ€™ the web the weaver craft made.
Spinners! yeâ€™ll spin and wind yourself a bonny pirn. And this young
birkie here, that yeâ€™re hoying and hounding on the shortest road to the
gallows and the deevil, will his stage-plays and his poetries help him
here, dye think, ony mair than your deep oaths and drawn dirks, ye
reprobate that ye are?--Will _Tityre tu patulae,_ as they caâ€™ it, tell
him where Rashleigh Osbaldistone is? or Macbeth, and all his kernes and
galla-glasses, and your awn to boot, Rob, procure him five thousand
pounds to answer the bills which fall due ten days hence, were they aâ€™
rouped at the Cross,--basket-hilts, Andra-Ferraras, leather targets,
brogues, brochan, and sporrans?â€

â€œTen days,â€ I answered, and instinctively drew out Diana Vernonâ€™s packet;
and the time being elapsed during which I was to keep the seal sacred, I
hastily broke it open. A sealed letter fell from a blank enclosure, owing
to the trepidation with which I opened the parcel. A slight current of
wind, which found its way through a broken pane of the window, wafted the
letter to Mr. Jarvieâ€™s feet, who lifted it, examined the address with
unceremonious curiosity, and, to my astonishment, handed it to his
Highland kinsman, saying, â€œHereâ€™s a wind has blown a letter to its right
owner, though there were ten thousand chances against its coming to
hand.â€

The Highlander, having examined the address, broke the letter open
without the least ceremony. I endeavoured to interrupt his proceeding.

â€œYou must satisfy me, sir,â€ said I, â€œthat the letter is intended for you
before I can permit you to peruse it.â€

â€œMake yourself quite easy, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ replied the mountaineer
with great composure.--â€œremember Justice Inglewood, Clerk Jobson, Mr.
Morris--above all, remember your vera humble servant, Robert Cawmil, and
the beautiful Diana Vernon. Remember all this, and doubt no longer that
the letter is for me.â€

I remained astonished at my own stupidity.--Through the whole night, the
voice, and even the features of this man, though imperfectly seen,
haunted me with recollections to which I could assign no exact local or
personal associations. But now the light dawned on me at once; this man
was Campbell himself. His whole peculiarities flashed on me at once,--the
deep strong voice--the inflexible, stern, yet considerate cast of
features--the Scottish brogue, with its corresponding dialect and
imagery, which, although he possessed the power at times of laying them
aside, recurred at every moment of emotion, and gave pith to his sarcasm,
or vehemence to his expostulation. Rather beneath the middle size than
above it, his limbs were formed upon the very strongest model that is
consistent with agility, while from the remarkable ease and freedom of
his movements, you could not doubt his possessing the latter quality in a
high degree of perfection. Two points in his person interfered with the
rules of symmetry; his shoulders were so broad in proportion to his
height, as, notwithstanding the lean and lathy appearance of his frame,
gave him something the air of being too square in respect to his stature;
and his arms, though round, sinewy, and strong, were so very long as to
be rather a deformity. I afterwards heard that this length of arm was a
circumstance on which he prided himself; that when he wore his native
Highland garb, he could tie the garters of his hose without stooping; and
that it gave him great advantage in the use of the broad-sword, at which
he was very dexterous. But certainly this want of symmetry destroyed the
claim he might otherwise have set up, to be accounted a very handsome
man; it gave something wild, irregular, and, as it were, unearthly, to
his appearance, and reminded me involuntarily of the tales which Mabel
used to tell of the old Picts who ravaged Northumberland in ancient
times, who, according to her tradition, were a sort of half-goblin
half-human beings, distinguished, like this man, for courage, cunning,
ferocity, the length of their arms, and the squareness of their
shoulders.

When, however, I recollected the circumstances in which we formerly met,
I could not doubt that the billet was most probably designed for him. He
had made a marked figure among those mysterious personages over whom
Diana seemed to exercise an influence, and from whom she experienced an
influence in her turn. It was painful to think that the fate of a being
so amiable was involved in that of desperadoes of this manâ€™s
description;--yet it seemed impossible to doubt it. Of what use, however,
could this person be to my fatherâ€™s affairs?--I could think only of one.
Rashleigh Osbaldistone had, at the instigation of Miss Vernon, certainly
found means to produce Mr. Campbell when his presence was necessary to
exculpate me from Morrisâ€™s accusation--Was it not possible that her
influence, in like manner, might prevail on Campbell to produce
Rashleigh? Speaking on this supposition, I requested to know where my
dangerous kinsman was, and when Mr. Campbell had seen him. The answer was
indirect.

â€œItâ€™s a kittle cast she has gien me to play; but yet itâ€™s fair play, and
I winna baulk her. Mr. Osbaldistone, I dwell not very far from hence--my
kinsman can show you the way--Leave Mr. Owen to do the best he can in
Glasgow--do you come and see me in the glens, and itâ€™s like I may
pleasure you, and stead your father in his extremity. I am but a poor
man; but witâ€™s better than wealth--and, cousinâ€ (turning from me to
address Mr. Jarvie), â€œif ye daur venture sae muckle as to eat a dish of
Scotch collops, and a leg oâ€™ red-deer venison wiâ€™ me, come ye wiâ€™ this
Sassenach gentleman as far as Drymen or Bucklivie,--or the Clachan of
Aberfoil will be better than ony oâ€™ them,--and Iâ€™ll hae somebody waiting
to weise ye the gate to the place where I may be for the time--What say
ye, man? Thereâ€™s my thumb, Iâ€™ll neâ€™er beguile thee.â€

â€œNa, na, Robin,â€ said the cautious burgher, â€œI seldom like to leave the
Gorbals; I have nae freedom to gang among your wild hills, Robin, and
your kilted red-shanks--it disna become my place, man.â€

â€œThe devil damn your place and you baith!â€ reiterated Campbell. â€œThe only
drap oâ€™ gentle bluid thatâ€™s in your body was our great-grand-uncleâ€™s that
was justified at Dumbarton, and you set yourself up to say ye wad
derogate frae your place to visit me!

Hark thee, man--I owe thee a day in harst--Iâ€™ll pay up your thousan pund
Scots, plack and bawbee, gin yeâ€™ll be an honest fallow for anes, and just
daiker up the gate wiâ€™ this Sassenach.â€

â€œHout awaâ€™ wiâ€™ your gentility,â€ replied the Bailie; â€œcarry your gentle
bluid to the Cross, and see what yeâ€™ll buy wiâ€™t. But, if I _were_ to
come, wad ye really and soothfastly pay me the siller?â€

â€œI swear to ye,â€ said the Highlander, â€œupon the halidome of him that
sleeps beneath the grey stane at Inch-Cailleach.â€

â€œSay nae mair, Robin--say nae mair--Weâ€™ll see what may be dune. But ye
maunna expect me to gang ower the Highland line--Iâ€™ll gae beyond the line
at no rate. Ye maun meet me about Bucklivie or the Clachan of
Aberfoil,--and dinna forget the needful.â€

â€œNae fear--nae fear,â€ said Campbell; â€œIâ€™ll be as true as the steel blade
that never failed its master. But I must be budging, cousin, for the air
oâ€™ Glasgow tolbooth is no that ower salutary to a Highlanderâ€™s
constitution.â€

â€œTroth,â€ replied the merchant, â€œand if my duty were to be dune, ye
couldna change your atmosphere, as the minister caâ€™s it, this ae wee
while.--Ochon, that I sud ever be concerned in aiding and abetting an
escape frae justice! it will be a shame and disgrace to me and mine, and
my very fatherâ€™s memory, for ever.â€

â€œHout tout, man! let that flee stick in the waâ€™,â€ answered his kinsman;
â€œwhen the dirtâ€™s dry it will rub out--Your father, honest man, could look
ower a friendâ€™s fault as weel as anither.â€

â€œYe may be right, Robin,â€ replied the Bailie, after a momentâ€™s
reflection; â€œhe was a considerate man the deacon; he kenâ€™d we had aâ€™ our
frailties, and he loâ€™ed his friends--Yeâ€™ll no hae forgotten him, Robin?â€
 This question he put in a softened tone, conveying as much at least of
the ludicrous as the pathetic.

â€œForgotten him!â€ replied his kinsman--â€œwhat suld ail me to forget him?--a
wapping weaver he was, and wrought my first pair oâ€™ hose.--But come awaâ€™,
kinsman,

              Come fill up my cap, come fill up my cann,
              Come saddle my horses, and call up my man;
              Come open your gates, and let me gae free,
                   I daurna stay langer in bonny Dundee.â€

â€œWhisht, sir!â€ said the magistrate, in an authoritative tone--â€œlilting
and singing sae near the latter end oâ€™ the Sabbath! This house may hear
ye sing anither tune yet--Aweel, we hae aâ€™ backslidings to answer
for--Stanchells, open the door.â€

The jailor obeyed, and we all sallied forth. Stanchells looked with some
surprise at the two strangers, wondering, doubtless, how they came into
these premises without his knowledge; but Mr. Jarvieâ€™s â€œFriends oâ€™ mine,
Stanchells--friends oâ€™ mine,â€ silenced all disposition to inquiries. We
now descended into the lower vestibule, and hallooed more than once for
Dougal, to which summons no answer was returned; when Campbell observed
with a sardonic smile, â€œThat if Dougal was the lad he kent him, he would
scarce wait to get thanks for his ain share of the nightâ€™s wark, but was
in all probability on the full trot to the pass of Ballamahaâ€--

â€œAnd left us--and, abune aâ€™, me, mysell, locked up in the tolbooth aâ€™
night!â€ exclaimed the Bailie, in ire and perturbation. â€œCaâ€™ for
forehammers, sledge-hammers, pinches, and coulters; send for Deacon
Yettlin, the smith, an let him ken that Bailie Jarvieâ€™s shut up in the
tolbooth by a Highland blackguard, whom heâ€™ll hang up as high as Hamanâ€--

â€œWhen ye catch him,â€ said Campbell, gravely; â€œbut stay--the door is
surely not locked.â€

Indeed, on examination, we found that the door was not only left open,
but that Dougal in his retreat had, by carrying off the keys along with
him, taken care that no one should exercise his office of porter in a
hurry.

â€œHe has glimmerings oâ€™ common sense now, that creature Dougal,â€ said
Campbell.--â€œhe kenâ€™d an open door might hae served me at a pinch.â€

We were by this time in the street.

â€œI tell you, Robin,â€ said the magistrate, â€œin my puir mind, if ye live
the life ye do, ye suld hae ane oâ€™ your gillies door-keeper in every jail
in Scotland, in case oâ€™ the warst.â€

â€œAne oâ€™ my kinsmen a bailie in ilka burgh will just do as weel, cousin
Nicol--So, gude-night or gude-morning to ye; and forget not the Clachan
of Aberfoil.â€

And without waiting for an answer, he sprung to the other side of the
street, and was lost in darkness. Immediately on his disappearance, we
heard him give a low whistle of peculiar modulation, which was instantly
replied to.

â€œHear to the Hieland deevils,â€ said Mr. Jarvie; â€œthey think themselves on
the skirts of Benlomond already, where they may gang whewingand whistling
about without minding Sunday or Saturday.â€ Here he was interrupted by
something which fell with a heavy clash on the street before us--â€œGude
guide us whatâ€™s this mair oâ€™t?--Mattie, haud up the lantern--Conscience
if it isna the keys!--Weel, thatâ€™s just as weel--they cost the burgh
siller, and there might hae been some clavers about the loss oâ€™ them. O,
an Bailie Grahame were to get word oâ€™ this nightâ€™s job, it would be a
sair hair in my neck!â€

As we were still but a few steps from the tolbooth door, we carried back
these implements of office, and consigned them to the head jailor, who,
in lieu of the usual mode of making good his post by turning the keys,
was keeping sentry in the vestibule till the arrival of some assistant,
whom he had summoned in order to replace the Celtic fugitive Dougal.

Having discharged this piece of duty to the burgh, and my road lying the
same way with the honest magistrateâ€™s, I profited by the light of his
lantern, and he by my arm, to find our way through the streets, which,
whatever they may now be, were then dark, uneven, and ill-paved. Age is
easily propitiated by attentions from the young. The Bailie expressed
himself interested in me, and added, â€œThat since I was nane oâ€™ that
play-acting and play-ganging generation, whom his saul hated, he wad be
glad if I wad eat a reisted haddock or a fresh herring, at breakfast wiâ€™
him the morn, and meet my friend, Mr. Owen, whom, by that time, he would
place at liberty.â€

â€œMy dear sir,â€ said I, when I had accepted of the invitation with thanks,
â€œhow could you possibly connect me with the stage?â€

â€œI watna,â€ replied Mr. Jarvie;--â€œit was a bletherinâ€™ phrasinâ€™ chield they
caâ€™ Fairservice, that cam at eâ€™en to get an order to send the crier
through the toun for ye at skreigh oâ€™ day the morn. He tellâ€™t me whae ye
were, and how ye were sent frae your fatherâ€™s house because ye wadna be a
dealer, and that ye mightna disgrace your family wiâ€™ ganging on the
stage. Ane Hammorgaw, our precentor, brought him here, and said he was an
auld acquaintance; but I sent them both away wiâ€™ a flae in their lug for
bringing me sic an errand, on sic a night. But I see heâ€™s a fule-creature
aâ€™thegither, and clean mistaen about ye. I like ye, man,â€ he continued;
â€œI like a lad that will stand by his friends in trouble--I aye did it
mysell, and sae did the deacon my father, rest and bless him! But ye
suldna keep ower muckle company wiâ€™ Hielandmen and thae wild cattle. Can
a man touch pitch and no be defiled?--aye mind that. Nae doubt, the best
and wisest may err--Once, twice, and thrice have I backslidden, man, and
dune three things this night--my father wadna hae believed his een if he
could hae looked up and seen me do them.â€

He was by this time arrived at the door of his own dwelling. He paused,
however, on the threshold, and went on in a solemn tone of deep
contrition,--â€œFirstly, I hae thought my ain thoughts on the
Sabbath--secondly, I hae giâ€™en security for an Englishman--and, in the
third and last place, well-a-day! I hae let an ill-doer escape from the
place of imprisonment--But thereâ€™s balm in Gilead, Mr. Osbaldistone--
Mattie, I can let mysell in--see Mr. Osbaldistone to Luckie Flyterâ€™s, at
the corner oâ€™ the wynd.--Mr. Osbaldistoneâ€--in a whisper--â€œyeâ€™ll offer
nae incivility to Mattie--sheâ€™s an honest manâ€™s daughter, and a near
cousin oâ€™ the Laird
oâ€™ Limmerfieldâ€™s.â€





CHAPTER SEVENTH.

     â€œWill it please your worship to accept of my poor service? I beseech
     that I may feed upon your bread, though it be the brownest, and
     drink of your drink, though it be of the smallest; for I will do
     your Worship as much service for forty shillings as another man
     shall for three pounds.â€
                                      Greeneâ€™s _Tu Quoque._

I remembered the honest Bailieâ€™s parting charge, but did not conceive
there was any incivility in adding a kiss to the half-crown with which I
remunerated Mattieâ€™s attendance;--nor did her â€œFie for shame, sir!â€
 express any very deadly resentment of the affront. Repeated knocking at
Mrs. Flyterâ€™s gate awakened in due order, first, one or two stray dogs,
who began to bark with all their might; next two or three night-capped
heads, which were thrust out of the neighbouring windows to reprehend me
for disturbing the solemnity of the Sunday night by that untimely noise.
While I trembled lest the thunders of their wrath might dissolve in
showers like that of Xantippe, Mrs. Flyter herself awoke, and began, in a
tone of objurgation not unbecoming the philosophical spouse of Socrates,
to scold one or two loiterers in her kitchen, for not hastening to the
door to prevent a repetition of my noisy summons.

These worthies were, indeed, nearly concerned in the fracas which their
laziness occasioned, being no other than the faithful Mr. Fairservice,
with his friend Mr. Hammorgaw, and another person, whom I afterwards
found to be the town-crier, who were sitting over a cog of ale, as they
called it (at my expense, as my bill afterwards informed me), in order to
devise the terms and style of a proclamation to be made through the
streets the next day, in order that â€œthe unfortunate young gentleman,â€ as
they had the impudence to qualify me, might be restored to his friends
without farther delay. It may be supposed that I did not suppress my
displeasure at this impertinent interference with my affairs; but Andrew
set up such ejaculations of transport at my arrival, as fairly drowned my
expressions of resentment. His raptures, perchance, were partly
political; and the tears of joy which he shed had certainly their source
in that noble fountain of emotion, the tankard. However, the tumultuous
glee which he felt, or pretended to feel, at my return, saved Andrew the
broken head which I had twice destined him;--first, on account of the
colloquy he had held with the precentor on my affairs; and secondly, for
the impertinent history he had thought proper to give of me to Mr.
Jarvie. I however contented myself with slapping the door of my bedroom
in his face as he followed me, praising Heaven for my safe return, and
mixing his joy with admonitions to me to take care how I walked my own
ways in future. I then went to bed, resolving my first business in the
morning should be to discharge this troublesome, pedantic, self-conceited
coxcomb, who seemed so much disposed to constitute himself rather a
preceptor than a domestic.

Accordingly in the morning I resumed my purpose, and calling Andrew into
my apartment, requested to know his charge for guiding and attending me
as far as Glasgow. Mr. Fairservice looked very blank at this demand,
justly considering it as a presage to approaching dismission.

â€œYour honour,â€ he said, after some hesitation, â€œwunna think--wunna
thinkâ€--

â€œSpeak out, you rascal, or Iâ€™ll break your head,â€ said I, as Andrew,
between the double risk of losing all by asking too much, or a part, by
stating his demand lower than what I might be willing to pay, stood
gasping in the agony of doubt and calculation.

Out it came with a bolt, however, at my threat; as the kind violence of a
blow on the back sometimes delivers the windpipe from an intrusive
morsel.--â€œAughteen pennies sterling per diem--that is, by the day--your
honour wadna think unconscionable.â€

â€œIt is double what is usual, and treble what you merit, Andrew; but
thereâ€™s a guinea for you, and get about your business.â€

â€œThe Lord forgiâ€™e us! Is your honour mad?â€ exclaimed Andrew.

â€œNo; but I think you mean to make me so--I give you a third above your
demand, and you stand staring and expostulating there as if I were
cheating you. Take your money, and go about your business.â€

â€œGude safe us!â€ continued Andrew, â€œin what can I hae offended your
honour? Certainly aâ€™ flesh is but as the flowers of the field; but if a
bed of camomile hath value in medicine, of a surety the use of Andrew
Fairservice to your honour is nothing less evident--itâ€™s as muckle as
your lifeâ€™s worth to part wiâ€™ me.â€

â€œUpon my honour,â€ replied I, â€œit is difficult to say whether you are more
knave or fool. So you intend then to remain with me whether I like it or
no?â€

â€œTroth, I was eâ€™en thinking sae,â€ replied Andrew, dogmatically; â€œfor if
your honour disna ken when ye hae a gude servant, I ken when I hae a gude
master, and the deil be in my feet gin I leave ye--and thereâ€™s the brief
and the lang oâ€™t besides I hae received nae regular warning to quit my
place.â€

â€œYour place, sir!â€ said I;--â€œwhy, you are no hired servant of mine,--you
are merely a guide, whose knowledge of the country I availed myself of on
my road.â€

â€œI am no just a common servant, I admit, sir,â€ remonstrated Mr.
Fairservice; â€œbut your honour kens I quitted a gude place at an hourâ€™s
notice, to comply wiâ€™ your honourâ€™s solicitations. A man might make
honestly, and wiâ€™ a clear conscience, twenty sterling pounds per annum,
weel counted siller, oâ€™ the garden at Osbaldistone Hall, and I wasna
likely to giâ€™e up aâ€™ that for a guinea, I trow--I reckoned on staying wiâ€™
your honour to the termâ€™s end at the least oâ€™t; and I account my wage,
board-wage, fee and bountith,--ay, to that length oâ€™t at the least.â€

â€œCome, come, sir,â€ replied I, â€œthese impudent pretensions wonâ€™t serve
your turn; and if I hear any more of them, I shall convince you that
Squire Thorncliff is not the only one of my name that can use his
fingers.â€

While I spoke thus, the whole matter struck me as so ridiculous, that,
though really angry, I had some difficulty to forbear laughing at the
gravity with which Andrew supported a plea so utterly extravagant. The
rascal, aware of the impression he had made on my muscles, was encouraged
to perseverance. He judged it safer, however, to take his pretensions a
peg lower, in case of overstraining at the same time both his plea and my
patience.

â€œAdmitting that my honour could part with a faithful servant, that had
served me and mine by day and night for twenty years, in a strange place,
and at a momentâ€™s warning, he was weel assured,â€ he said, â€œit wasna in my
heart, nor in no true gentlemanâ€™s, to pit a puir lad like himself, that
had come forty or fifty, or say a hundred miles out oâ€™ his road purely to
bear my honour company, and that had nae handing but his penny-fee, to
sic a hardship as this comes to.â€

I think it was you, Will, who once told me, that, to be an obstinate man,
I am in certain things the most gullable and malleable of mortals. The
fact is, that it is only contradiction which makes me peremptory, and
when I do not feel myself called on to give battle to any proposition, I
am always willing to grant it, rather than give myself much trouble. I
knew this fellow to be a greedy, tiresome, meddling coxcomb; still,
however, I must have some one about me in the quality of guide and
domestic, and I was so much used to Andrewâ€™s humour, that on some
occasions it was rather amusing. In the state of indecision to which
these reflections led me, I asked Fairservice if he knew the roads,
towns, etc., in the north of Scotland, to which my fatherâ€™s concerns with
the proprietors of Highland forests were likely to lead me. I believe if
I had asked him the road to the terrestrial paradise, he would have at
that moment undertaken to guide me to it; so that I had reason afterwards
to think myself fortunate in finding that his actual knowledge did not
fall very much short of that which he asserted himself to possess. I
fixed the amount of his wages, and reserved to myself the privilege of
dismissing him when I chose, on paying him a week in advance. I gave him
finally a severe lecture on his conduct of the preceding day, and then
dismissed him rejoicing at heart, though somewhat crestfallen in
countenance, to rehearse to his friend the precentor, who was taking his
morning draught in the kitchen, the mode in which he had â€œcuitled up the
daft young English squire.â€

Agreeable to appointment, I went next to Bailie Nicol Jarvieâ€™s, where a
comfortable morningâ€™s repast was arranged in the parlour, which served as
an apartment of all hours, and almost all work, to that honest gentleman.
The bustling and benevolent magistrate had been as good as his word. I
found my friend Owen at liberty, and, conscious of the refreshments and
purification of brush and basin, was of course a very different person
from Owen a prisoner, squalid, heart-broken, and hopeless. Yet the sense
of pecuniary difficulties arising behind, before, and around him, had
depressed his spirit, and the almost paternal embrace which the good man
gave me, was embittered by a sigh of the deepest anxiety. And when he
sate down, the heaviness in his eye and manner, so different from the
quiet composed satisfaction which they usually exhibited, indicated that
he was employing his arithmetic in mentally numbering up the days, the
hours, the minutes, which yet remained as an interval between the
dishonour of bills and the downfall of the great commercial establishment
of Osbaldistone and Tresham. It was left to me, therefore, to do honour
to our landlordâ€™s hospitable cheer--to his tea, right from China, which
he got in a present from some eminent shipâ€™s-husband at Wapping--to his
coffee, from a snug plantation of his own, as he informed us with a wink,
called Saltmarket Grove, in the island of Jamaica--to his English toast
and ale, his Scotch dried salmon, his Lochfine herrings, and even to the
double-damask table-cloth, â€œwrought by no hand, as you may guess,â€ save
that of his deceased father the worthy Deacon Jarvie.

Having conciliated our good-humoured host by those little attentions
which are great to most men, I endeavoured in my turn to gain from him
some information which might be useful for my guidance, as well as for
the satisfaction of my curiosity. We had not hitherto made the least
allusion to the transactions of the preceding night, a circumstance which
made my question sound somewhat abrupt, when, without any previous
introduction of the subject, I took advantage of a pause when the history
of the table-cloth ended, and that of the napkins was about to commence,
to inquire, â€œPray, by the by, Mr. Jarvie, who may this Mr. Robert
Campbell be, whom we met with last night?â€

The interrogatory seemed to strike the honest magistrate, to use the
vulgar phrase, â€œall of a heap,â€ and instead of answering, he returned the
question--â€œWhaeâ€™s Mr. Robert Campbell?--ahem! ahay! Whaeâ€™s Mr. Robert
Campbell, quoâ€™ he?â€

â€œYes,â€ said I, â€œI mean who and what is he?â€

â€œWhy, heâ€™s--ahay!--heâ€™s--ahem!--Where did ye meet with Mr. Robert
Campbell, as ye caâ€™ him?â€

â€œI met him by chance,â€ I replied, â€œsome months ago in the north of
England.â€

â€œOu then, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ said the Bailie, doggedly, â€œyeâ€™ll ken as
muckle about him as I do.â€

â€œI should suppose not, Mr. Jarvie,â€ I replied;--â€œyou are his relation, it
seems, and his friend.â€

â€œThere is some cousin-red between us, doubtless,â€ said the Bailie
reluctantly; â€œbut we hae seen little oâ€™ ilk other since Rob gae tip the
cattle-line oâ€™ dealing, poor fallow! he was hardly guided by them might
hae used him better--and they haena made their plack a bawbee oâ€™t
neither. Thereâ€™s mony ane this day wad rather they had never chased puir
Robin frae the Cross oâ€™ Glasgow--thereâ€™s mony ane wad rather see him
again at the tale oâ€™ three hundred kyloes, than at the head oâ€™ thirty
waur cattle.â€

â€œAll this explains nothing to me, Mr. Jarvie, of Mr. Campbellâ€™s rank,
habits of life, and means of subsistence,â€ I replied.

â€œRank?â€ said Mr. Jarvie; â€œheâ€™s a Hieland gentleman, nae doubt--better
rank need nane to be;--and for habit, I judge he wears the Hieland habit
amang the hills, though he has breeks on when he comes to Glasgow;--and
as for his subsistence, what needs we care about his subsistence, sae
lang as he asks naething frae us, ye ken? But I hae nae time for
clavering about him eâ€™en now, because we maun look into your fatherâ€™s
concerns wiâ€™ all speed.â€

So saying, he put on his spectacles, and sate down to examine Mr. Owenâ€™s
states, which the other thought it most prudent to communicate to him
without reserve. I knew enough of business to be aware that nothing could
be more acute and sagacious than the views which Mr. Jarvie entertained
of the matters submitted to his examination; and, to do him justice, it
was marked by much fairness, and even liberality. He scratched his ear
indeed repeatedly on observing the balance which stood at the debit of
Osbaldistone and Tresham in account with himself personally.

â€œIt may be a dead loss,â€ he observed; â€œand, conscience! whateâ€™er ane oâ€™
your Lombard Street goldsmiths may say to it, itâ€™s a snell ane in the
Saut-Market oâ€™ Glasgow. It will be a heavy deficit--a staff out oâ€™ my
bicker, I trow.

But what then?--I trust the house wunna coup the crane for aâ€™ thatâ€™s come
and gane yet; and if it does, Iâ€™ll never bear sae base a mind as thae
corbies in the Gallowgate--an I am to lose by ye, Iâ€™se neâ€™er deny I hae
won by ye mony a fair pund sterling--Sae, an it come to the warst, Iâ€™se
een lay the head oâ€™ the sow to the tail oâ€™ the grice.â€

I did not altogether understand the proverbial arrangement with which Mr.
Jarvie consoled himself, but I could easily see that he took a kind and
friendly interest in the arrangement of my fatherâ€™s affairs, suggested
several expedients, approved several plans proposed by Owen, and by his
countenance and counsel greatly abated the gloom upon the brow of that
afflicted delegate of my fatherâ€™s establishment.

As I was an idle spectator on this occasion, and, perhaps, as I showed
some inclination more than once to return to the prohibited, and
apparently the puzzling subject of Mr. Campbell, Mr. Jarvie dismissed me
with little formality, with an advice to â€œgang up the gate to the
college, where I wad find some chields could speak Greek and Latin
weel--at least they got plenty oâ€™ siller for doing deil haet else, if they
didna do that; and where I might read a spell oâ€™ the worthy Mr. Zachary
Boydâ€™s translation oâ€™ the Scriptures--better poetry need nane to be, as
he had been tellâ€™d by them that kenâ€™d or suld hae kenâ€™d about sic
things.â€ But he seasoned this dismission with a kind and hospitable
invitation â€œto come back and take part oâ€™ his family-chack at ane
preceesely--there wad be a leg oâ€™ mutton, and, it might be, a tupâ€™s head,
for they were in season;â€ but above all, I was to return at â€œane oâ€™clock
preceesely--it was the hour he and the deacon his father aye dined
at--they pat it off for naething nor for naebody.â€





CHAPTER EIGHTH.


              So stands the Thracian herdsman with his spear
              Full in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear;
              And hears him in the rustling wood, and sees
              His course at distance by the bending trees,
                  And thinks--Here comes my mortal enemy,
                  And either he must fall in fight, or I.
                                         Palamon and Arcite.

I took the route towards the college, as recommended by Mr. Jarvie, less
with the intention of seeking for any object of interest or amusement,
than to arrange my own ideas, and meditate on my future conduct. I
wandered from one quadrangle of old-fashioned buildings to another, and
from thence to the College-yards, or walking ground, where, pleased with
the solitude of the place, most of the students being engaged in their
classes, I took several turns, pondering on the waywardness of my own
destiny.

I could not doubt, from the circumstances attending my first meeting with
this person Campbell, that he was engaged in some strangely desperate
courses; and the reluctance with which Mr. Jarvie alluded to his person
or pursuits, as well as all the scene of the preceding night, tended to
confirm these suspicions. Yet to this man Diana Vernon had not, it would
seem, hesitated to address herself in my behalf; and the conduct of the
magistrate himself towards him showed an odd mixture of kindness, and
even respect, with pity and censure. Something there must be uncommon in
Campbellâ€™s situation and character; and what was still more
extraordinary, it seemed that his fate was doomed to have influence over,
and connection with, my own. I resolved to bring Mr. Jarvie to close
quarters on the first proper opportunity, and learn as much as was
possible on the subject of this mysterious person, in order that I might
judge whether it was possible for me, without prejudice to my reputation,
to hold that degree of farther correspondence with him to which he seemed
to invite.

While I was musing on these subjects, my attention was attracted by three
persons who appeared at the upper end of the walk through which I was
sauntering, seemingly engaged in very earnest conversation. That
intuitive impression which announces to us the approach of whomsoever we
love or hate with intense vehemence, long before a more indifferent eye
can recognise their persons, flashed upon my mind the sure conviction
that the midmost of these three men was Rashleigh Osbaldistone. To
address him was my first impulse;--my second was, to watch him until he
was alone, or at least to reconnoitre his companions before confronting
him. The party was still at such distance, and engaged in such deep
discourse, that I had time to step unobserved to the other side of a
small hedge, which imperfectly screened the alley in which I was walking.
It was at this period the fashion of the young and gay to wear, in their
morning walks, a scarlet cloak, often laced and embroidered, above their
other dress, and it was the trick of the time for gallants occasionally
to dispose it so as to muffle a part of the face. The imitating this
fashion, with the degree of shelter which I received from the hedge,
enabled me to meet my cousin, unobserved by him or the others, except
perhaps as a passing stranger. I was not a little startled at recognising
in his companions that very Morris on whose account I had been summoned
before Justice Inglewood, and Mr. MacVittie the merchant, from whose
starched and severe aspect I had recoiled on the preceding day.

A more ominous conjunction to my own affairs, and those of my father,
could scarce have been formed. I remembered Morrisâ€™s false accusation
against me, which he might be as easily induced to renew as he had been
intimidated to withdraw; I recollected the inauspicious influence of
MacVittie over my fatherâ€™s affairs, testified by the imprisonment of
Owen;--and I now saw both these men combined with one, whose talent for
mischief I deemed little inferior to those of the great author of all
ill, and my abhorrence of whom almost amounted to dread.

When they had passed me for some paces, I turned and followed them
unobserved. At the end of the walk they separated, Morris and MacVittie
leaving the gardens, and Rashleigh returning alone through the walks. I
was now determined to confront him, and demand reparation for the
injuries he had done my father, though in what form redress was likely to
be rendered remained to be known. This, however, I trusted to chance; and
flinging back the cloak in which I was muffled, I passed through a gap of
the low hedge, and presented myself before Rashleigh, as, in a deep
reverie, he paced down the avenue.

Rashleigh was no man to be surprised or thrown off his guard by sudden
occurrences. Yet he did not find me thus close to him, wearing
undoubtedly in my face the marks of that indignation which was glowing in
my bosom, without visibly starting at an apparition so sudden and
menacing.

â€œYou are well met, sir,â€ was my commencement; â€œI was about to take a long
and doubtful journey in quest of you.â€

â€œYou know little of him you sought then,â€ replied Rashleigh, with his
usual undaunted composure. â€œI am easily found by my friends--still more
easily by my foes;--your manner compels me to ask in which class I must
rank Mr. Francis Osbaldistone?â€

â€œIn that of your foes, sir,â€ I answered--â€œin that of your mortal foes,
unless you instantly do justice to your benefactor, my father, by
accounting for his property.â€

â€œAnd to whom, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ answered Rashleigh, â€œam I, a member of
your fatherâ€™s commercial establishment, to be compelled to give any
account of my proceedings in those concerns, which are in every respect
identified with my own?--Surely not to a young gentleman whose exquisite
taste for literature would render such discussions disgusting and
unintelligible.â€

â€œYour sneer, sir, is no answer; I will not part with you until I have
full satisfaction concerning the fraud you meditate--you shall go with me
before a magistrate.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ said Rashleigh, and made a step or two as if to accompany me;
then pausing, proceeded--â€œWere I inclined to do so as you would have me,
you should soon feel which of us had most reason to dread the presence of
a magistrate. But I have no wish to accelerate your fate. Go, young man!
amuse yourself in your world of poetical imaginations, and leave the
business of life to those who understand and can conduct it.â€

His intention, I believe, was to provoke me, and he succeeded. â€œMr.
Osbaldistone,â€ I said, â€œthis tone of calm insolence shall not avail you.
You ought to be aware that the name we both bear never submitted to
insult, and shall not in my person be exposed to it.â€

â€œYou remind me,â€ said Rashleigh, with one of his blackest looks, â€œthat it
was dishonoured in my person!--and you remind me also by whom! Do you
think I have forgotten the evening at Osbaldistone Hall when you cheaply
and with impunity played the bully at my expense? For that insult--never
to be washed out but by blood!--for the various times you have crossed my
path, and always to my prejudice--for the persevering folly with which
you seek to traverse schemes, the importance of which you neither know
nor are capable of estimating,--for all these, sir, you owe me a long
account, for which there shall come an early day of reckoning.â€

â€œLet it come when it will,â€ I replied, â€œI shall be willing and ready to
meet it. Yet you seem to have forgotten the heaviest article--that I had
the pleasure to aid Miss Vernonâ€™s good sense and virtuous feeling in
extricating her from your infamous toils.â€

I think his dark eyes flashed actual fire at this home-taunt, and yet his
voice retained the same calm expressive tone with which he had hitherto
conducted the conversation.

â€œI had other views with respect to you, young man,â€ was his answer: â€œless
hazardous for you, and more suitable to my present character and former
education. But I see you will draw on yourself the personal chastisement
your boyish insolence so well merits. Follow me to a more remote spot,
where we are less likely to be interrupted.â€

I followed him accordingly, keeping a strict eye on his motions, for I
believed him capable of the very worst actions. We reached an open spot
in a sort of wilderness, laid out in the Dutch taste, with clipped
hedges, and one or two statues. I was on my guard, and it was well with
me that I was so; for Rashleighâ€™s sword was out and at my breast ere I
could throw down my cloak, or get my weapon unsheathed, so that I only
saved my life by springing a pace or two backwards. He had some advantage
in the difference of our weapons; for his sword, as I recollect, was
longer than mine, and had one of those bayonet or three-cornered blades
which are now generally worn; whereas mine was what we then called a
Saxon blade--narrow, flat, and two-edged, and scarcely so manageable as
that of my enemy. In other respects we were pretty equally matched: for
what advantage I might possess in superior address and agility, was fully
counterbalanced by Rashleighâ€™s great strength and coolness. He fought,
indeed, more like a fiend than a man--with concentrated spite and desire
of blood, only allayed by that cool consideration which made his worst
actions appear yet worse from the air of deliberate premeditation which
seemed to accompany them. His obvious malignity of purpose never for a
moment threw him off his guard, and he exhausted every feint and
stratagem proper to the science of defence; while, at the same time, he
meditated the most desperate catastrophe to our rencounter.

On my part, the combat was at first sustained with more moderation. My
passions, though hasty, were not malevolent; and the walk of two or three
minutesâ€™ space gave me time to reflect that Rashleigh was my fatherâ€™s
nephew, the son of an uncle, who after his fashion had been kind to me,
and that his falling by my hand could not but occasion much family
distress. My first resolution, therefore, was to attempt to disarm my
antagonist--a manoeuvre in which, confiding in my superiority of skill
and practice, I anticipated little difficulty. I found, however, I had
met my match; and one or two foils which I received, and from the
consequences of which I narrowly escaped, obliged me to observe more
caution in my mode of fighting. By degrees I became exasperated at the
rancour with which Rashleigh sought my life, and returned his passes with
an inveteracy resembling in some degree his own; so that the combat had
all the appearance of being destined to have a tragic issue. That issue
had nearly taken place at my expense. My foot slipped in a full lounge
which I made at my adversary, and I could not so far recover myself as
completely to parry the thrust with which my pass was repaid. Yet it took
but partial effect, running through my waistcoat, grazing my ribs, and
passing through my coat behind. The hilt of Rashleighâ€™s sword, so great
was the vigour of his thrust, struck against my breast with such force as
to give me great pain, and confirm me in the momentary belief that I was
mortally wounded. Eager for revenge, I grappled with my enemy, seizing
with my left hand the hilt of his sword, and shortening my own with the
purpose of running him through the body. Our death-grapple was
interrupted by a man who forcibly threw himself between us, and pushing
us separate from each other, exclaimed, in a loud and commanding voice,
â€œWhat! the sons of those fathers who sucked the same breast shedding each
others bluid as it were strangersâ€™!--By the hand of my father, I will
cleave to the brisket the first man that mints another stroke!â€

I looked up in astonishment. The speaker was no other than Campbell. He
had a basket-hilted broadsword drawn in his hand, which he made to
whistle around his head as he spoke, as if for the purpose of enforcing
his mediation. Rashleigh and I stared in silence at this unexpected
intruder, who proceeded to exhort us alternately:--â€œDo you, Maister
Francis, opine that ye will re-establish your fatherâ€™s credit by cutting
your kinsmanâ€™s thrapple, or getting your ain sneckit instead thereof in
the College-yards of Glasgow?--Or do you, Mr Rashleigh, think men will
trust their lives and fortunes wiâ€™ ane, that, when in point of trust and
in point of confidence wiâ€™ a great political interest, gangs about
brawling like a drunken gillie?--Nay, never look gash or grim at me,
man--if yeâ€™re angry, ye ken how to turn the buckle oâ€™ your belt behind
you.â€

â€œYou presume on my present situation,â€ replied Rashleigh, â€œor you would
have hardly dared to interfere where my honour is concerned.â€


â€œHout! tout! tout!--Presume? And what for should it be presuming?--Ye may
be the richer man, Mr. Osbaldistone, as is maist likely; and ye may be
the mair learned man, whilk I dispute not: but I reckon ye are neither a
prettier man nor a better gentleman than mysell--and it will be news to
me when I hear ye are as gude. And _dare_ too? Muckle daring thereâ€™s
about it--I trow, here I stand, that hae slashed as het a haggis as ony
oâ€™ the twa oâ€™ ye, and thought nae muckle oâ€™ my morningâ€™s wark when it was
dune. If my foot were on the heather as itâ€™s on the causeway, or this
pickle gravel, thatâ€™s little better, I hae been waur mistrysted than if I
were set to gie ye baith your serâ€™ing oâ€™t.â€

Rashleigh had by this time recovered his temper completely. â€œMy kinsman,â€
 he said, â€œwill acknowledge he forced this quarrel on me. It was none of
my seeking. I am glad we are interrupted before I chastised his
forwardness more severely.â€

â€œAre ye hurt, lad?â€ inquired Campbell of me, with some appearance of
interest.

â€œA very slight scratch,â€ I answered, â€œwhich my kind cousin would not long
have boasted of had not you come between us.â€

â€œIn troth, and thatâ€™s true, Maister Rashleigh,â€ said Campbell; â€œfor the
cauld iron and your best bluid were like to hae become acquaint when I
mastered Mr. Frankâ€™s right hand. But never look like a sow playing upon a
trump for the luve of that, man--come and walk wiâ€™ me. I hae news to tell
ye, and yeâ€™ll cool and come to yourself, like MacGibbonâ€™s crowdy, when he
set it out at the window-bole.â€

â€œPardon me, sir,â€ said I. â€œYour intentions have seemed friendly to me on
more occasions than one; but I must not, and will not, quit sight of this
person until he yields up to me those means of doing justice to my
fatherâ€™s engagements, of which he has treacherously possessed himself.â€

â€œYeâ€™re daft, man,â€ replied Campbell; â€œit will serve ye naething to follow
us eâ€™enow; ye hae just enow oâ€™ ae man--wad ye bring twa on your head, and
might bide quiet?â€

â€œTwenty,â€ I replied, â€œif it be necessary.â€

I laid my hand on Rashleighâ€™s collar, who made no resistance, but said,
with a sort of scornful smile, â€œYou hear him, MacGregor! he rushes on his
fate--will it be my fault if he falls into it?--The warrants are by this
time ready, and all is prepared.â€

The Scotchman was obviously embarrassed. He looked around, and before,
and behind him, and then said--â€œThe neâ€™er a bit will I yield my consent
to his being ill-guided for standing up for the father that got him--and
I gie Godâ€™s malison and mine to aâ€™ sort oâ€™ magistrates, justices,
bailies., sheriffs, sheriff-officers, constables, and sic-like black
cattle, that hae been the plagues oâ€™ puir auld Scotland this hunder
year.--it was a merry warld when every man held his ain gear wiâ€™ his ain
grip, and when the country side wasna fashed wiâ€™ warrants and poindings
and apprizings, and aâ€™ that cheatry craft. And ance mair I say it, my
conscience winna see this puir thoughtless lad ill-guided, and especially
wiâ€™ that sort oâ€™ trade. I wad rather ye fell tillâ€™t again, and fought it
out like douce honest men.â€

â€œYour conscience, MacGregor!â€ said Rashleigh; â€œyou forget how long you
and I have known each other.â€

â€œYes, my conscience,â€ reiterated Campbell, or MacGregor, or whatever was
his name; â€œI hae such a thing about me, Maister Osbaldistone; and therein
it may weel chance that I hae the better oâ€™ you. As to our knowledge of
each other,--if ye ken what I am, ye ken what usage it was made me what I
am; and, whatever you may think, I would not change states with the
proudest of the oppressors that hae driven me to tak the heather-bush for
a beild. What _you_ are, Maister Rashleigh, and what excuse ye hae for
being _what_ you are, is between your ain heart and the lang day.--And
now, Maister Francis, let go his collar; for he says truly, that ye are
in mair danger from a magistrate than he is, and were your cause as
straight as an arrow, he wad find a way to put you wrang--So let go his
craig, as I was saying.â€

He seconded his words with an effort so sudden and unexpected, that he
freed Rashleigh from my hold, and securing me, notwithstanding my
struggles, in his own Herculean gripe, he called out--â€œTake the bent, Mr.
Rashleigh--Make ae pair oâ€™ legs worth twa pair oâ€™ hands; ye hae dune that
before now.â€

â€œYou may thank this gentleman, kinsman,â€ said Rashleigh, â€œif I leave any
part of my debt to you unpaid; and if I quit you now, it is only in the
hope we shall soon meet again without the possibility of interruption.â€

He took up his sword, wiped it, sheathed it, and was lost among the
bushes.

The Scotchman, partly by force, partly by remonstrance, prevented my
following him; indeed I began to be of opinion my doing so would be to
little purpose.

â€œAs I live by bread,â€ said Campbell, when, after one or two struggles in
which he used much forbearance towards me, he perceived me inclined to
stand quiet, â€œI never saw sae daft a callant! I wad hae gien the best man
in the country the breadth oâ€™ his back gin he had gien me sic a kemping
as ye hae dune. What wad ye do?--Wad ye follow the wolf to his den? I
tell ye, man, he has the auld trap set for ye--He has got the
collector-creature Morris to bring up aâ€™ the auld story again,
and ye maun look for nae help frae me here, as ye got at Justice
Inglewoodâ€™s;--it isna good for my health to come in the gate oâ€™ the
whigamore bailie bodies. Now gang your ways hame, like a gude
bairn--jouk and let the jaw gae by--Keep out oâ€™ sight oâ€™ Rashleigh, and
Morris, and that MacVittie animal--Mind the Clachan of Aberfoil, as I
said before, and by the word of a gentleman, I wunna see ye wranged. But
keep a calm sough till we meet again--I maun gae and get Rashleigh out
oâ€™ the town afore waur comes oâ€™t, for the neb oâ€™ himâ€™s never out oâ€™
mischief--Mind the Clachan of Aberfoil.â€

He turned upon his heel, and left me to meditate on the singular events
which had befallen me. My first care was to adjust my dress and reassume
my cloak, disposing it so as to conceal the blood which flowed down my
right side. I had scarcely accomplished this, when, the classes of the
college being dismissed, the gardens began to be filled with parties of
the students. I therefore left them as soon as possible; and in my way
towards Mr. Jarvieâ€™s, whose dinner hour was now approaching, I stopped at
a small unpretending shop, the sign of which intimated the indweller to
be Christopher Neilson, surgeon and apothecary. I requested of a little
boy who was pounding some stuff in a mortar, that he would procure me an
audience of this learned pharmacopolist. He opened the door of the back
shop, where I found a lively elderly man, who shook his head
incredulously at some idle account I gave him of having been wounded
accidentally by the button breaking off my antagonistâ€™s foil while I was
engaged in a fencing match. When he had applied some lint and somewhat
else he thought proper to the trifling wound I had received, he
observed--â€œThere never was button on the foil that made this hurt. Ah!
young blood! young blood!--But we surgeons are a secret generation--If
it werena for hot blood and ill blood, what wad become of the twa
learned faculties?â€

With which moral reflection he dismissed me; and I experienced very
little pain or inconvenience afterwards from the scratch I had received.

â€œWhat made ye sae late?â€ said Mr. Jarvie, as I entered the dining-parlour
of that honest gentleman; â€œit is chappit ane the best feek oâ€™ five
minutes by-gane. Mattie has been twice at the door wiâ€™ the dinner, and
weel for you it was a tupâ€™s head, for that canna suffer by delay. A
sheepâ€™s head ower muckle boiled is rank poison, as my worthy father used
to say--he likit the lug oâ€™ ane weel, honest man.â€

I made a suitable apology for my breach of punctuality, and was soon
seated at table, where Mr. Jarvie presided with great glee and
hospitality, compelling, however, Owen and myself to do rather more
justice to the Scottish dainties with which his board was charged, than
was quite agreeable to our southern palates. I escaped pretty well, from
having those habits of society which enable one to elude this species of
well-meant persecution. But it was ridiculous enough to see Owen, whose
ideas of politeness were more rigorous and formal, and who was willing,
in all acts of lawful compliance, to evince his respect for the friend of
the firm, eating with rueful complaisance mouthful after mouthful of
singed wool, and pronouncing it excellent, in a tone in which disgust
almost overpowered civility.

When the cloth was removed, Mr. Jarvie compounded with his own hands a
very small bowl of brandy-punch, the first which I had ever the fortune
to see.

â€œThe limes,â€ he assured us, â€œwere from his own little farm yonder-awaâ€
 (indicating the West Indies with a knowing shrug of his shoulders), â€œand
he had learned the art of composing the liquor from auld Captain
Coffinkey, who acquired it,â€ he added in a whisper, â€œâ€˜as maist folk
thought, among the Buccaniers. But itâ€™s excellent liquor,â€ said he,
helping us round; â€œand good ware has aften come frae a wicked market. And
as for Captain Coffinkey, he was a decent man when I kent him, only he
used to swear awfully--But heâ€™s dead, and gaen to his account, and I
trust heâ€™s accepted--I trust heâ€™s accepted.â€

We found the liquor exceedingly palatable, and it led to a long
conversation between Owen and our host on the opening which the Union had
afforded to trade between Glasgow and the British Colonies in America and
the West Indies, and on the facilities which Glasgow possessed of making
up sortable cargoes for that market. Mr. Jarvie answered some objection
which Owen made on the difficulty of sorting a cargo for America, without
buying from England, with vehemence and volubility.

â€œNa, na, sir, we stand on our ain bottom--we pickle in our ain
pock-neuk--We hae our Stirling serges, Musselburgh stuffs, Aberdeen hose,
Edinburgh shalloons, and the like, for our woollen or worsted goods--and
we hae linens of aâ€™ kinds better and cheaper than you hae in Lunnon
itsell--and we can buy your north oâ€™ England wares, as Manchester wares,
Sheffield wares, and Newcastle earthenware, as cheap as you can at
Liverpool--And we are making a fair spell at cottons and muslins--Na, na!
let every herring hing by its ain head, and every sheep by its ain shank,
and yeâ€™ll find, sir, us Glasgow folk no sae far ahint but what we may
follow.--This is but poor entertainment for you, Mr. Osbaldistoneâ€
 (observing that I had been for some time silent); â€œbut ye ken cadgers
maun aye be speaking about cart-saddles.â€

I apologised, alleging the painful circumstances of my own situation, and
the singular adventures of the morning, as the causes of my abstraction
and absence of mind. In this manner I gained what I sought--an
opportunity of telling my story distinctly and without interruption. I
only omitted mentioning the wound I had received, which I did not think
worthy of notice. Mr. Jarvie listened with great attention and apparent
interest, twinkling his little grey eyes, taking snuff, and only
interrupting me by brief interjections. When I came to the account of the
rencounter, at which Owen folded his hands and cast up his eyes to
Heaven, the very image of woeful surprise, Mr. Jarvie broke in upon the
narration with â€œWrang now--clean wrang--to draw a sword on your kinsman
is inhibited by the laws oâ€™ God and man; and to draw a sword on the
streets of a royal burgh is punishable by fine and imprisonment--and the
College-yards are nae better privileged--they should be a place of peace
and quietness, I trow. The College didna get gude L600 a year out oâ€™
bishopsâ€™ rents (sorrow faâ€™ the brood oâ€™ bishops and their rents too!),
nor yet a lease oâ€™ the archbishopric oâ€™ Glasgow the sell oâ€™t, that they
suld let folk tuilzie in their yards, or the wild callants bicker there
wiâ€™ snaw-baâ€™s as they whiles do, that when Mattie and I gae through, we
are fain to make a baik and a bow, or run the risk oâ€™ our harns being
knocked out--it suld be looked to.--But come awaâ€™wiâ€™ your tale--what
fell neist?â€

On my mentioning the appearance of Mr. Campbell, Jarvie arose in great
surprise, and paced the room, exclaiming, â€œRobin again!--Robertâ€™s
mad--clean wud, and waur--Rob will be hanged, and disgrace aâ€™ his
kindred, and that will be seen and heard tell oâ€™. My father the deacon
wrought him his first hose--Od, I am thinking Deacon Threeplie, the
rape-spinner, will be twisting his last cravat. Ay, ay, puir Robin is in
a fair way oâ€™ being hanged--But come awaâ€™, come awaâ€™--letâ€™s hear the
lave oâ€™t.â€

I told the whole story as pointedly as I could; but Mr. Jarvie still
found something lacking to make it clear, until I went back, though with
considerable reluctance, on the whole story of Morris, and of my meeting
with Campbell at the house of Justice Inglewood. Mr. Jarvie inclined a
serious ear to all this, and remained silent for some time after I had
finished my narrative.

â€œUpon all these matters I am now to ask your advice, Mr. Jarvie, which, I
have no doubt, will point out the best way to act for my fatherâ€™s
advantage and my own honour.â€

â€œYeâ€™re right, young man--yeâ€™re right,â€ said the Bailie. â€œAye take the
counsel of those who are aulder and wiser than yourself, and binna like
the godless Rehoboam, who took the advice oâ€™ a wheen beardless callants,
neglecting the auld counsellors who had sate at the feet oâ€™ his father
Solomon, and, as it was weel put by Mr. Meiklejohn, in his lecture on the
chapter, were doubtless partakers of his sapience. But I maun hear
naething about honour--we ken naething here but about credit. Honour is a
homicide and a bloodspiller, that gangs about making frays in the street;
but Credit is a decent honest man, that sits at hame and makes the pat
play.â€

â€œAssuredly, Mr. Jarvie,â€ said our friend Owen, â€œcredit is the sum total;
and if we can but save that, at whatever discountâ€--

â€œYe are right, Mr. Owen--ye are right; ye speak weel and wisely; and I
trust bowls will row right, though they are a wee ajee eâ€™enow. But
touching Robin, I am of opinion he will befriend this young man if it is
in his power. He has a gude heart, puir Robin; and though I lost a matter
oâ€™ twa hundred punds wiâ€™ his former engagements, and haena muckle
expectation ever to see back my thousand punds Scots that he promises me
eâ€™enow, yet I will never say but what Robin means fair by men.â€

â€œI am then to consider him,â€ I replied, â€œas an honest man?â€

â€œUmph!â€ replied Jarvie, with a precautionary sort of cough--â€œAy, he has a
kind oâ€™ Hieland honesty--heâ€™s honest after a sort, as they say. My father
the deacon used aye to laugh when he tauld me how that by-word came up.
Ane Captain Costlett was cracking crouse about his loyalty to King
Charles, and Clerk Pettigrew (yeâ€™ll hae heard mony a tale about him)
asked him after what manner he served the king, when he was fighting
again him at Worâ€™ster in Cromwellâ€™s army; and Captain Costlett was a
ready body, and said that he served him _after a sort._ My honest father
used to laugh weel at that sport--and sae the by-word came up.â€

â€œBut do you think,â€ I said, â€œthat this man will be able to serve me after
a sort, or should I trust myself to this place of rendezvous which he has
given me?â€

â€œFrankly and fairly, itâ€™s worth trying. Ye see yourself thereâ€™s some risk
in your staying here. This bit body Morris has gotten a custom-house
place doun at Greenock--thatâ€™s a port on the Firth doun by here; and thoâ€™
aâ€™ the world kens him to be but a twa-leggit creature, wiâ€™ a gooseâ€™s head
and a henâ€™s heart, that goes about on the quay plaguing folk about
permits, and cockits, and dockits, and aâ€™ that vexatious trade, yet if he
lodge an information--ou, nae doubt a man in magisterial duty maun attend
to it, and ye might come to be clapped up between four waâ€™s, whilk wad be
ill-convenient to your fatherâ€™s affairs.â€

â€œTrue,â€ I observed; â€œyet what service am I likely to render him by
leaving Glasgow, which, it is probable, will be the principal scene of
Rashleighâ€™s machinations, and committing myself to the doubtful faith of
a man of whom I know little but that he fears justice, and has doubtless
good reasons for doing so; and that, for some secret, and probably
dangerous purpose, he is in close league and alliance with the very
person who is like to be the author of our ruin?â€

â€œAh, but ye judge Rob hardly,â€ said the Bailie, â€œye judge him hardly,
puir chield; and the truth is, that ye ken naething about our hill
country, or Hielands, as we caâ€™ them. They are clean anither set frae the
like oâ€™ huz;--thereâ€™s nae bailie-courts amang them--nae magistrates that
dinna bear the sword in vain, like the worthy deacon thatâ€™s awaâ€™, and, I
may sayâ€™t, like mysell and other present magistrates in this city--But
itâ€™s just the lairdâ€™s command, and the loon maun loup; and the never
another law hae they but the length oâ€™ their dirks--the broadswordâ€™s
pursuer, or plaintiff, as you Englishers caâ€™ it, and the target is
defender; the stoutest head bears langest out;--and thereâ€™s a Hieland
plea for ye.â€

Owen groaned deeply; and I allow that the description did not greatly
increase my desire to trust myself in a country so lawless as he
described these Scottish mountains.

â€œNow, sir,â€ said Jarvie, â€œwe speak little oâ€™ thae things, because they
are familiar to oursells; and whereâ€™s the use oâ€™ vilifying aneâ€™s country,
and bringing a discredit on aneâ€™s kin, before southrons and strangers?
Itâ€™s an ill bird that files its ain nest.â€

â€œWell, sir, but as it is no impertinent curiosity of mine, but real
necessity, that obliges me to make these inquiries, I hope you will not
be offended at my pressing for a little farther information. I have to
deal, on my fatherâ€™s account, with several gentlemen of these wild
countries, and I must trust your good sense and experience for the
requisite lights upon the subject.â€

This little morsel of flattery was not thrown out in vain. â€œExperience!â€
 said the Bailie--â€œI hae had experience, nae doubt, and I hae made some
calculations--Ay, and to speak quietly amang oursells, I hae made some
perquisitions through Andrew Wylie, my auld clerk; heâ€™s wiâ€™ MacVittie &
Co. now--but he whiles drinks a gill on the Saturday afternoons wiâ€™ his
auld master. And since ye say ye are willing to be guided by the Glasgow
weaver-bodyâ€™s advice, I am no the man that will refuse it to the son of
an auld correspondent, and my father the deacon was nane sic afore me. I
have whiles thought oâ€™ letting my lights burn before the Duke of Argyle,
or his brother Lord Ilay (for wherefore should they be hidden under a
bushel?), but the like oâ€™ thae grit men wadna mind the like oâ€™ me, a puir
wabster body--they think mair oâ€™ wha says a thing, than oâ€™ what the thing
is thatâ€™s said. The mairâ€™s the pity--mairâ€™s the pity. Not that I wad
speak ony ill of this MacCallum More--â€˜Curse not the rich in your
bedchamber,â€™ saith the son of Sirach, â€˜for a bird of the air shall carry
the clatter, and pint-stoups hae lang lugs.â€™â€

I interrupted these prolegomena, in which Mr. Jarvie was apt to be
somewhat diffuse, by praying him to rely upon Mr. Owen and myself as
perfectly secret and safe confidants.

â€œItâ€™s no for that,â€ he replied, â€œfor I fear nae man--what for suld I?--I
speak nae treason--Only thae Hielandmen hae lang grips, and I whiles gang
a wee bit up the glens to see some auld kinsfolks, and I wadna willingly
be in bad blude wiâ€™ ony oâ€™ their clans. Howsumever, to proceed--ye maun
understand I found my remarks on figures, whilk as Mr. Owen here weel
kens, is the only true demonstrable root of human knowledge.â€

Owen readily assented to a proposition so much in his own way, and our
orator proceeded.

â€œThese Hielands of ours, as we caâ€™ them, gentlemen, are but a wild kind
of warld by themsells, full of heights and howes, woods, caverns, lochs,
rivers, and mountains, that it wad tire the very deevilâ€™s wings to flee
to the tap oâ€™ them. And in this country, and in the isles, whilk are
little better, or, to speak the truth, rather waur than the mainland,
there are about twa hunder and thirty parochines, including the Orkneys,
where, whether they speak Gaelic or no I wotna, but they are an
uncivilised people. Now, sirs, I sall haud ilk parochine at the moderate
estimate of eight hunder examinable persons, deducting children under
nine years of age, and then adding one-fifth to stand for bairns of nine
years auld, and under, the whole population will reach to the sum of--let
us add one-fifth to 800 to be the multiplier, and 230 being the
multiplicandâ€--

â€œThe product,â€ said Mr. Owen, who entered delightedly into these
statistics of Mr. Jarvie, â€œwill be 230,000.â€

â€œRight, sir--perfectly right; and the military array of this Hieland
country, were aâ€™ the men-folk between aughteen and fifty-six brought out
that could bear arms, couldna come weel short of fifty-seven thousand
five hundred men. Now, sir, itâ€™s a sad and awfuâ€™ truth, that there is
neither wark, nor the very fashion nor appearance of wark, for the tae
half of thae puir creatures; that is to say, that the agriculture, the
pasturage, the fisheries, and every species of honest industry about the
country, cannot employ the one moiety of the population, let them work as
lazily as they like, and they do work as if a pleugh or a spade burnt
their fingers. Aweel, sir, this moiety of unemployed bodies, amounting
toâ€--

â€œTo one hundred and fifteen thousand souls,â€ said Owen, â€œbeing the half
of the above product.â€

â€œYe haeâ€™t, Mr. Owen--ye haeâ€™t--whereof there may be twenty-eight thousand
seven hundred able-bodied gillies fit to bear arms, and that do bear
arms, and will touch or look at nae honest means of livelihood even if
they could get it--which, lack-a-day! they cannot.â€

â€œBut is it possible,â€ said I, â€œMr. Jarvie, that this can be a just
picture of so large a portion of the island of Britain?â€

â€œSir, Iâ€™ll make it as plain as Peter Pasleyâ€™s pike-staff. I will allow
that ilk parochine, on an average, employs fifty pleughs, whilk is a
great proportion in sic miserable soil as thae creatures hae to labour,
and that there may be pasture enough for pleugh-horses, and owsen, and
forty or fifty cows; now, to take care oâ€™ the pleughs and cattle, weâ€™se
allow seventy-five families of six lives in ilk family, and weâ€™se add
fifty mair to make even numbers, and ye hae five hundred souls, the tae
half oâ€™ the population, employed and maintained in a sort oâ€™ fashion, wiâ€™
some chance of sour-milk and crowdie; but I wad be glad to ken what the
other five hunder are to do?â€

â€œIn the name of God!â€ said I, â€œwhat _do_ they do, Mr. Jarvie? It makes me
shudder to think of their situation.â€

â€œSir,â€ replied the Bailie, â€œye wad maybe shudder mair if ye were living
near hand them. For, admitting that the tae half of them may make some
little thing for themsells honestly in the Lowlands by shearing in harst,
droving, hay-making, and the like; ye hae still mony hundreds and
thousands oâ€™ lang-legged Hieland gillies that will neither work nor want,
and maun gang thigging and sorning about on their acquaintance, or live
by doing the lairdâ€™s bidding, beâ€™t right or beâ€™t wrang.

And mair especially, mony hundreds oâ€™ them come down to the borders of
the low country, where thereâ€™s gear to grip, and live by stealing,
reiving, lifting cows, and the like depredations--a thing deplorable in
ony Christian country!--the mair especially, that they take pride in it,
and reckon driving a spreagh (whilk is, in plain Scotch, stealing a herd
of nowte) a gallant, manly action, and mair befitting of pretty men (as
sic reivers will caâ€™ themselves), than to win a dayâ€™s wage by ony honest
thrift.

And the lairds are as bad as the loons; for if they dinna bid them gae
reive and harry, the deil a bit they forbid them; and they shelter them,
or let them shelter themselves, in their woods and mountains, and
strongholds, whenever the thingâ€™s dune. And every ane oâ€™ them will
maintain as mony oâ€™ his ane name, or his clan, as we say, as he can rap
and rend means for; or, whilkâ€™s the same thing, as mony as can in ony
fashion, fair or foul, mainteen themsells. And there they are wiâ€™ gun and
pistol, dirk and dourlach, ready to disturb the peace oâ€™ the country
whenever the laird likes; and thatâ€™s the grievance of the Hielands, whilk
are, and hae been for this thousand years by-past, a bike oâ€™ the maist
lawless unchristian limmers that ever disturbed a douce, quiet,
God-fearing neighbourhood, like this oâ€™ ours in the west here.â€

â€œAnd this kinsman of yours, and friend of mine, is he one of those great
proprietors who maintain the household troops you speak of?â€ I inquired.

â€œNa, na,â€ said Bailie Jarvie; â€œheâ€™s nane oâ€™ your great grandees oâ€™
chiefs, as they caâ€™ them, neither. Though he is weel born, and lineally
descended frae auld Glenstrae--I ken his lineage--indeed he is a near
kinsman, and, as I said, of gude gentle Hieland blude, though ye may
think weel that I care little about that nonsense--itâ€™s aâ€™ moonshine in
water--waste threads and thrums, as we say--But I could show ye letters
frae his father, that was the third aff Glenstrae, to my father Deacon
Jarvie (peace be wiâ€™ his memory!) beginning, Dear Deacon, and ending,
your loving kinsman to command,--they are amaist aâ€™ about borrowed
siller, sae the gude deacon, thatâ€™s dead and gane, keepit them as
documents and evidents--He was a carefuâ€™ man.â€

â€œBut if he is not,â€ I resumed, â€œone of their chiefs or patriarchal
leaders, whom I have heard my father talk of, this kinsman of yours has,
at least, much to say in the Highlands, I presume?â€

â€œYe may say that--nae name better kenâ€™d between the Lennox and
Breadalbane. Robin was ance a weel-doing, painstaking drover, as ye wad
see amang ten thousand--It was a pleasure to see him in his belted plaid
and brogues, wiâ€™ his target at his back, and claymore and dirk at his
belt, following a hundred Highland stots, and a dozen oâ€™ the gillies, as
rough and ragged as the beasts they drave. And he was baith civil and
just in his dealings; and if he thought his chapman had made a hard
bargain, he wad gie him a luck-penny to the mends. I hae kenâ€™d him gie
back five shillings out oâ€™ the pund sterling.â€

â€œTwenty-five per cent,â€ said Owen--â€œa heavy discount.â€

â€œHe wad gie it though, sir, as I tell ye; mair especially if he thought
the buyer was a puir man, and couldna stand by a loss. But the times cam
hard, and Rob was venturesome. It wasna my faut--it wasna my faut; he
canna wyte me--I aye tauld him oâ€™t--And the creditors, mair especially
some grit neighbours oâ€™ his, gripped to his living and land; and they say
his wife was turned out oâ€™ the house to the hill-side, and sair misguided
to the boot. Shamefuâ€™! shamefuâ€™!--I am a peacefuâ€™ man and a magistrate,
but if ony ane had guided sae muckle as my servant quean, Mattie, as itâ€™s
like they guided Robâ€™s wife, I think it suld hae set the shabble that my
father the deacon had at Bothwell brig a-walking again.

Weel, Rob cam hame, and fand desolation, God pity us! where he left
plenty; he looked east, west, south, north, and saw neither hauld nor
hope--neither beild nor shelter; sae he eâ€™en puâ€™d the bonnet ower his
brow, belted the broadsword to his side, took to the brae-side, and
became a broken man.â€

The voice of the good citizen was broken by his contending feelings. He
obviously, while he professed to contemn the pedigree of his Highland
kinsman, attached a secret feeling of consequence to the connection, and
he spoke of his friend in his prosperity with an overflow of affection,
which deepened his sympathy for his misfortunes, and his regret for their
consequences.

â€œThus tempted and urged by despair,â€ said I, seeing Mr. Jarvie did not
proceed in his narrative, â€œI suppose your kinsman became one of those
depredators you have described to us?â€

â€œNo sae bad as that,â€ said the Glaswegian,--â€œno aâ€™thegither and outright
sae bad as that; but he became a levier of black-mail, wider and farther
than ever it was raised in our day, a through the Lennox and Menteith,
and up to the gates oâ€™ Stirling Castle.â€

â€œBlack-mail?--I do not understand the phrase,â€ I remarked.

â€œOu, ye see, Rob soon gathered an unco band oâ€™ blue-bonnets at his back,
for he comes oâ€™ a rough name when heâ€™s kent by his ain, and a name thatâ€™s
held its ain for mony a lang year, baith again king and parliament, and
kirk too, for aught I ken--an auld and honourable name, for as sair as it
has been worried and hadden down and oppressed. My mother was a
MacGregor--I carena wha kens it--And Rob had soon a gallant band; and as
it grieved him (he said) to see sic _hership_ and waste and depredation
to the south oâ€™ the Hieland line, why, if ony heritor or farmer wad pay
him four punds Scots out of each hundred punds of valued rent, whilk
was doubtless a moderate consideration, Rob engaged to keep them
scaithless;--let them send to him if they lost sae muckle as a single
cloot by thieving, and Rob engaged to get them again, or pay the
value--and he aye keepit his word--I canna deny but he keepit his
word--aâ€™ men allow Rob keeps his word.â€

â€œThis is a very singular contract of assurance,â€ said Mr. Owen.

â€œItâ€™s clean again our statute law, that must be owned,â€ said Jarvie,
â€œclean again law; the levying and the paying black-mail are baith
punishable: but if the law canna protect my barn and byre, whatfor suld I
no engage wiâ€™ a Hieland gentleman that can?--answer me that.â€

â€œBut,â€ said I, â€œMr. Jarvie, is this contract of black-mail, as you call
it, completely voluntary on the part of the landlord or farmer who pays
the insurance? or what usually happens, in case any one refuses payment
of this tribute?â€

â€œAha, lad!â€ said the Bailie, laughing, and putting his finger to his
nose, â€œye think ye hae me there. Troth, I wad advise ony friends oâ€™ mine
to gree wiâ€™ Rob; for, watch as they like, and do what they like, they are
sair apt to be harried when the lang nights come on.

Some oâ€™ the Grahame and Cohoon gentry stood out; but what then?--they
lost their haill stock the first winter; sae maist folks now think it
best to come into Robâ€™s terms. Heâ€™s easy wiâ€™ aâ€™ body that will be easy
wiâ€™ him; but if ye thraw him, ye had better thraw the deevil.â€

â€œAnd by his exploits in these vocations,â€ I continued, â€œI suppose he has
rendered himself amenable to the laws of the country?â€

â€œAmenable?--ye may say that; his craig wad ken the weight oâ€™ his hurdies
if they could get haud oâ€™ Rob. But he has gude friends amang the grit
folks; and I could tell ye oâ€™ ae grit family that keeps him up as far as
they decently can, to be a them in the side of another. And then heâ€™s sic
an auld-farran lang-headed chield as never took up the trade oâ€™ cateran
in our time; mony a daft reik he has played--mair than wad fill a book,
and a queer ane it wad be--as gude as Robin Hood, or William Wallace--aâ€™
fuâ€™ oâ€™ venturesome deeds and escapes, sic as folk tell ower at a winter
ingle in the daft days. Itâ€™s a queer thing oâ€™ me, gentlemen, that am a
man oâ€™ peace mysell, and a peacefu manâ€™s son--for the deacon my father
quarrelled wiâ€™ nane out o the town-council--itâ€™s a queer thing, I say,
but I think the Hieland blude oâ€™ me warms at thae daft tales, and whiles
I like better to hear them than a word oâ€™ profit, gude forgie me! But
they are vanities--sinfuâ€™ vanities--and, moreover, again the statute
law--again the statute and gospel law.â€

I now followed up my investigation, by inquiring what means of influence
this Mr. Robert Campbell could possibly possess over my affairs, or those
of my father.

â€œWhy, ye are to understand,â€ said Mr. Jarvie in a very subdued tone--â€œI
speak amang friends, and under the rose--Ye are to understand, that the
Hielands hae been keepit quiet since the year aughty-nine--that was
Killiecrankie year. But how hae they been keepit quiet, think ye? By
siller, Mr. Owen--by siller, Mr. Osbaldistone. King William caused
Breadalbane distribute twenty thousand oude punds sterling amang them,
and itâ€™s said the auld Hieland Earl keepit a lang lug oâ€™t in his ain
sporran. And then Queen Anne, thatâ€™s dead, gae the chiefs bits oâ€™
pensions, sae they had wherewith to support their gillies and caterans
that work nae wark, as I said afore; and they lay by quiet eneugh, saying
some spreagherie on the Lowlands, whilk is their use and wont, and some
cutting oâ€™ thrapples amang themsells, that nae civilised body kens or
cares onything anent.--Weel, but thereâ€™s a new warld come up wiâ€™ this
King George (I say, God bless him, for ane)--thereâ€™s neither like to be
siller nor pensions gaun amang them; they haena the means oâ€™ mainteening
the clans that eat them up, as ye may guess frae what I said before;
their creditâ€™s gane in the Lowlands; and a man that can whistle ye up a
thousand or feifteen hundred linking lads to do his will, wad hardly get
fifty punds on his band at the Cross oâ€™ Glasgow--This canna stand
lang--there will be an outbreak for the Stuarts--there will be an
outbreak--they will come down on the low country like a flood, as they
did in the waefuâ€™ wars oâ€™ Montrose, and that will be seen and heard tell
oâ€™ ere a twalmonth gangs round.â€

â€œYet still,â€ I said, â€œI do not see how this concerns Mr. Campbell, much
less my fatherâ€™s affairs.â€

â€œRob can levy five hundred men, sir, and therefore war suld concern him
as muckle as maist folk,â€ replied the Bailie; â€œfor it is a faculty that
is far less profitable in time oâ€™ peace. Then, to tell ye the truth, I
doubt he has been the prime agent between some oâ€™ our Hieland chiefs and
the gentlemen in the north oâ€™ England. We aâ€™ heard oâ€™ the public money
that was taen frae the chield Morris somewhere about the fit oâ€™ Cheviot
by Rob and ane oâ€™ the Osbaldistone lads; and, to tell ye the truth, word
gaed that it was yoursell Mr. Francis,--and sorry was I that your
fatherâ€™s son suld hae taen to sic practices--Na, ye needna say a word
about it--I see weel I was mistaen; but I wad believe onything oâ€™ a
stage-player, whilk I concluded ye to be. But now, I doubtna, it has been
Rashleigh himself or some other oâ€™ your cousins--they are aâ€™ tarred wiâ€™
the same stick--rank Jacobites and papists, and wad think the government
siller and government papers lawfuâ€™ prize. And the creature Morris is sic
a cowardly caitiff, that to this hour he daurna say that it was Rob took
the portmanteau aff him; and troth heâ€™s right, for your custom-house and
excise cattle are ill liket on aâ€™ sides, and Rob might get a back-handed
lick at him, before the Board, as they caâ€™t, could help him.â€

â€œI have long suspected this, Mr. Jarvie,â€ said I, â€œand perfectly agree
with you. But as to my fatherâ€™s affairsâ€--

â€œSuspected it?--itâ€™s certain--itâ€™s certain--I ken them that saw some of
the papers that were taen aff Morris--itâ€™s needless to say where. But to
your fatherâ€™s affairs--Ye maun think that in thae twenty years by-gane,
some oâ€™ the Hieland lairds and chiefs hae come to some smaâ€™ sense oâ€™
their ain interest--your father and others hae bought the woods of
Glen-Disseries, Glen Kissoch, Tober-na-Kippoch, and mony mair besides,
and your fatherâ€™s house has granted large bills in payment,--and as the
credit oâ€™ Osbaldistone and Tresham was gude--for Iâ€™ll say before Mr.
Owenâ€™s face, as I wad behind his back, that, bating misfortunes oâ€™ the
Lordâ€™s sending, nae men could be mair honourable in business--the Hieland
gentlemen, holders oâ€™ thae bills, hae found credit in Glasgow and
Edinburgh--(I might amaist say in Glasgow wholly, for itâ€™s little the
pridefuâ€™ Edinburgh folk do in real business)--for all, or the greater
part of the contents oâ€™ thae bills. So that--Aha! dâ€™ye see me now?â€

I confessed I could not quite follow his drift.

â€œWhy,â€ said he, â€œif these bills are not paid, the Glasgow merchant comes
on the Hieland lairds, whae hae deil a boddle oâ€™ siller, and will like
ill to spew up what is item aâ€™ spent--They will turn desperate--five
hundred will rise that might hae sitten at hame--the deil will gae ower
Jock Wabster--and the stopping of your fatherâ€™s house will hasten the
outbreak thatâ€™s been sae lang biding us.â€

â€œYou think, then,â€ said I, surprised at this singular view of the case,
â€œthat Rashleigh Osbaldistone has done this injury to my father, merely to
accelerate a rising in the Highlands, by distressing the gentlemen to whom
these bills were originally granted?â€

â€œDoubtless--doubtless--it has been one main reason, Mr. Osbaldistone. I
doubtna but what the ready money he carried off wiâ€™ him might be another.
But that makes comparatively but a smaâ€™ part oâ€™ your fatherâ€™s loss,
though it might make the maist part oâ€™ Rashleighâ€™s direct gain. The
assets he carried off are of nae mair use to him than if he were to light
his pipe wiâ€™ them. He tried if MacVittie & Co. wad gie him siller on
them--that I ken by Andro Wylie--but they were ower auld cats to draw
that strae afore them--they keepit aff, and gae fair words. Rashleigh
Osbaldistone is better kenâ€™d than trusted in Glasgow, for he was here
about some jacobitical papistical troking in seventeen hundred and seven,
and left debt ahint him. Na, na--he canna pit aff the paper here; folk
will misdoubt him how he came by it. Na, na--heâ€™ll hae the stuff safe at
some oâ€™ their haulds in the Hielands, and I daur say my cousin Rob could
get at it gin he liked.â€

â€œBut would he be disposed to serve us in this pinch, Mr. Jarvie?â€ said I.
â€œYou have described him as an agent of the Jacobite party, and deeply
connected in their intrigues: will he be disposed for my sake, or, if you
please, for the sake of justice, to make an act of restitution, which,
supposing it in his power, would, according to your view of the case,
materially interfere with their plans?â€

â€œI canna preceesely speak to that: the grandees among them are doubtfuâ€™
oâ€™ Rob, and heâ€™s doubtfuâ€™ oâ€™ them.--And heâ€™s been weel friended wiâ€™ the
Argyle family, wha stand for the present model of government. If he was
freed oâ€™ his hornings and captions, he would rather be on Argyleâ€™s side
than he wad be on Breadalbaneâ€™s, for thereâ€™s auld ill-will between the
Breadalbane family and his kin and name. The truth is, that Rob is for
his ain hand, as Henry Wynd feught--heâ€™ll take the side that suits him
best; if the deil was laird, Rob wad be for being tenant; and ye canna
blame him, puir fallow, considering his circumstances.

â€œBut thereâ€™s ae thing sair again ye--Rob has a grey mear in his stable at
hame.â€

â€œA grey mare?â€ said I. â€œWhat is that to the purpose?â€

â€œThe wife, man--the wife,--an awfuâ€™ wife she is. She downa bide the sight
oâ€™ a kindly Scot, if he come frae the Lowlands, far less of an Inglisher,
and sheâ€™ll be keen for aâ€™ that can set up King James, and ding down King
George.â€

â€œIt is very singular,â€ I replied, â€œthat the mercantile transactions of
London citizens should become involved with revolutions and rebellions.â€

â€œNot at aâ€™, man--not at aâ€™,â€ returned Mr. Jarvie; â€œthatâ€™s aâ€™ your silly
prejudications. I read whiles in the lang dark nights, and I hae read in
Bakerâ€™s Chronicle that the merchants oâ€™London could gar the Bank of
Genoa break their promise to advance a mighty sum to the King oâ€™ Spain,
whereby the sailing of the Grand Spanish Armada was put aff for a haill
year--What think you of that, sir?â€

â€œThat the merchants did their country golden service, which ought to be
honourably remembered in our histories.â€

â€œI think sae too; and they wad do weel, and deserve weal baith oâ€™ the
state and oâ€™ humanity, that wad save three or four honest Hieland
gentlemen frae louping heads ower heels into destruction, wiâ€™ aâ€™ their
puir sackless followers, just because they canna pay back the siller
they had reason to count upon as their ain--and save your fatherâ€™s
credit--and my ain gude siller that Osbaldistone and Tresham awes me into
the bargain.

I say, if ane could manage aâ€™ this, I think it suld be done and said unto
him, even if he were a puir caâ€™-the-shuttle body, as unto one whom the
king delighteth to honour.â€

â€œI cannot pretend to estimate the extent of public gratitude,â€ I replied;
â€œbut our own thankfulness, Mr. Jarvie, would be commensurate with the
extent of the obligation.â€

â€œWhich,â€ added Mr. Owen, â€œwe would endeavour to balance with a _per
contra,_ the instant our Mr. Osbaldistone returns from Holland.â€

â€œI doubtna--I doubtna--he is a very worthy gentleman, and a sponsible,
and wiâ€™ some oâ€™ my lights might do muckle business in Scotland--Weel,
sir, if these assets could be redeemed out oâ€™ the hands oâ€™ the
Philistines, they are gude paper--they are the right stuff when they are
in the right hands, and thatâ€™s yours, Mr. Owen. And Iâ€™se find ye three
men in Glasgow, for as little as ye may think oâ€™ us, Mr. Owen--thatâ€™s
Sandie Steenson in the Tradeâ€™s-Land, and John Pirie in Candleriggs, and
another that sall be nameless at this present, sall advance what soums
are sufficient to secure the credit of your house, and seek nae better
security.â€

Owenâ€™s eyes sparkled at this prospect of extrication; but his countenance
instantly fell on recollecting how improbable it was that the recovery of
the assets, as he technically called them, should be successfully
achieved.

â€œDinna despair, sir--dinna despair,â€ said Mr. Jarvie; â€œI hae taen sae
muckle concern wiâ€™ your affairs already, that it maun een be ower shoon
ower boots wiâ€™ me now. I am just like my father the deacon (praise be wiâ€™
him!) I canna meddle wiâ€™ a friendâ€™s business, but I aye end wiâ€™ making it
my ain--Sae, Iâ€™ll eâ€™en pit on my boots the morn, and be jogging ower
Drymen Muir wiâ€™ Mr. Frank here; and if I canna mak Rob hear reason, and
his wife too, I dinna ken wha can--I hae been a kind freend to them afore
now, to say naething oâ€™ ower-looking him last night, when naming his name
wad hae cost him his life--Iâ€™ll be hearing oâ€™ this in the council maybe
frae Bailie Grahame and MacVittie, and some oâ€™ them. They hae coost up
my kindred to Rob to me already--set up their nashgabs! I tauld them I
wad vindicate nae manâ€™s faults; but set apart what he had done again the
law oâ€™ the country, and the hership oâ€™ the Lennox, and the misfortune oâ€™
some folk losing life by him, he was an honester man than stood on ony oâ€™
their shanks--And whatfor suld I mind their clavers? If Rob is an outlaw,
to himsell be it said--there is nae laws now about reset of
inter-communed persons, as there was in the ill times oâ€™ the last
Stuarts--I trow I hae a Scotch tongue in my head--if they speak, Iâ€™se
answer.â€

It was with great pleasure that I saw the Bailie gradually surmount the
barriers of caution, under the united influence of public spirit and
good-natured interest in our affairs, together with his natural wish to
avoid loss and acquire gain, and not a little harmless vanity. Through
the combined operation of these motives, he at length arrived at the
doughty resolution of taking the field in person, to aid in the recovery
of my fatherâ€™s property. His whole information led me to believe, that if
the papers were in possession of this Highland adventurer, it might be
possible to induce him to surrender what he could not keep with any
prospect of personal advantage; and I was conscious that the presence of
his kinsman was likely to have considerable weight with him. I therefore
cheerfully acquiesced in Mr. Jarvieâ€™s proposal that we should set out
early next morning.

That honest gentleman was indeed as vivacious and alert in preparing to
carry his purpose into execution, as he had been slow and cautious in
forming it. He roared to Mattie to â€œair his trot-cosey, to have his
jack-boots greased and set before the kitchen-fire all night, and to see
that his beast be corned, and aâ€™ his riding gear in order.â€ Having agreed
to meet him at five oâ€™clock next morning, and having settled that Owen,
whose presence could be of no use to us upon this expedition, should
await our return at Glasgow, we took a kind farewell of this unexpectedly
zealous friend. I installed Owen in an apartment in my lodgings,
contiguous to my own, and, giving orders to Andrew Fairservice to attend
me next morning at the hour appointed, I retired to rest with better
hopes than it had lately been my fortune to entertain.





CHAPTER TENTH.

             Far as the eye could reach no tree was seen,
             Earth, clad in russet, scorned the lively green;
                No birds, except as birds of passage flew;
                No bee was heard to hum, no dove to coo;
                No streams, as amber smooth-as amber clear,
                Were seen to glide, or heard to warble here.
                                             Prophecy of Famine.

It was in the bracing atmosphere of a harvest morning, that I met by
appointment Fairservice, with the horses, at the door of Mr. Jarvieâ€™s
house, which was but little space distant from Mrs. Flyterâ€™s hotel. The
first matter which caught my attention was, that whatever were the
deficiencies of the pony which Mr. Fairserviceâ€™s legal adviser, Clerk
Touthope, generously bestowed upon him in exchange for Thorncliffâ€™s mare,
he had contrived to part with it, and procure in its stead an animal with
so curious and complete a lameness, that it seemed only to make use of
three legs for the purpose of progression, while the fourth appeared as
if meant to be flourished in the air by way of accompaniment. â€œWhat do
you mean by bringing such a creature as that here, sir? and where is the
pony you rode to Glasgow upon?â€ were my very natural and impatient
inquiries.

â€œI sellâ€™t it, sir. It was a slink beast, and wad hae eaten its head aff,
standing at Luckie Flyterâ€™s at livery. And I hae bought this on your
honourâ€™s account. Itâ€™s a grand bargain--cost but a pund sterling the
foot--thatâ€™s four aâ€™thegither. The stringhalt will gae aff when itâ€™s gaen
a mile; itâ€™s a weel-kenâ€™d ganger; they call it Souple Tam.â€

â€œOn my soul, sir,â€ said I, â€œyou will never rest till my supple-jack and
your shoulders become acquainted. If you do not go instantly and procure
the other brute, you shall pay the penalty of your ingenuity.â€

Andrew, notwithstanding my threats, continued to battle the point, as he
said it would cost him a guinea of rue-bargain to the man who had bought
his pony, before he could get it back again. Like a true Englishman,
though sensible I was duped by the rascal, I was about to pay his
exaction rather than lose time, when forth sallied Mr. Jarvie, cloaked,
mantled, hooded, and booted, as if for a Siberian winter, while two
apprentices, under the immediate direction of Mattie, led forth the
decent ambling steed which had the honour on such occasions to support
the person of the Glasgow magistrate. Ere he â€œclombe to the saddle,â€ an
expression more descriptive of the Bailieâ€™s mode of mounting than that of
the knights-errant to whom Spenser applies it, he inquired the cause of
the dispute betwixt my servant and me. Having learned the nature of
honest Andrewâ€™s manoeuvre he instantly cut short all debate, by
pronouncing, that if Fairservice did not forthwith return the
three-legged palfrey, and produce the more useful quadruped which he had
discarded, he would send him to prison, and amerce him in half his wages.
â€œMr. Osbaldistone,â€ said he, â€œcontracted for the service of both your
horse and you--twa brutes at ance--ye unconscionable rascal!--but Iâ€™se
look weel after you during this journey.â€

â€œIt will be nonsense fining me,â€ said Andrew, doughtily, â€œthat hasna a
grey groat to pay a fine wiâ€™--itâ€™s ill taking the breeks aff a
Hielandman.â€

â€œIf ye hae nae purse to fine, ye hae flesh to pine,â€ replied the Bailie,
â€œand I will look weel to ye getting your deserts the tae way or the
tither.â€

To the commands of Mr. Jarvie, therefore, Andrew was compelled to submit,
only muttering between his teeth, â€œOwer mony maisters,--ower mony
maisters, as the paddock said to the harrow, when every tooth gae her a
tig.â€

Apparently he found no difficulty in getting rid of Supple Tam, and
recovering possession of his former Bucephalus, for he accomplished the
exchange without being many minutes absent; nor did I hear further of his
having paid any smart-money for breach of bargain.

We now set forward, but had not reached the top of the street in which
Mr. Jarvie dwelt, when a loud hallooing and breathless call of â€œStop,
stop!â€ was heard behind us. We stopped accordingly, and were overtaken by
Mr. Jarvieâ€™s two lads, who bore two parting tokens of Mattieâ€™s care for
her master. The first was conveyed in the form of a voluminous silk
handkerchief, like the mainsail of one of his own West-Indiamen, which
Mrs. Mattie particularly desired he would put about his neck, and which,
thus entreated, he added to his other integuments. The second youngster
brought only a verbal charge (I thought I saw the rogue disposed to laugh
as he delivered it) on the part of the housekeeper, that her master would
take care of the waters. â€œPooh! pooh! silly hussy,â€ answered Mr. Jarvie;
but added, turning to me, â€œit shows a kind heart though--it shows a kind
heart in sae young a quean--Mattieâ€™s a carefuâ€™ lass.â€ So speaking, he
pricked the sides of his palfrey, and we left the town without farther
interruption.

While we paced easily forward, by a road which conducted us
north-eastward from the town, I had an opportunity to estimate and admire
the good qualities of my new friend. Although, like my father, he
considered commercial transactions the most important objects of human
life, he was not wedded to them so as to undervalue more general
knowledge. On the contrary, with much oddity and vulgarity of
manner,--with a vanity which he made much more ridiculous by disguising
it now and then under a thin veil of humility, and devoid as he was of
all the advantages of a learned education, Mr. Jarvieâ€™s conversation
showed tokens of a shrewd, observing, liberal, and, to the extent of its
opportunities, a well-improved mind. He was a good local antiquary, and
entertained me, as we passed along, with an account of remarkable events
which had formerly taken place in the scenes through which we passed.
And as he was well acquainted with the ancient history of his district,
he saw with the prospective eye of an enlightened patriot, the buds of
many of those future advantages which have only blossomed and ripened
within these few years. I remarked also, and with great pleasure, that
although a keen Scotchman, and abundantly zealous for the honour of his
country, he was disposed to think liberally of the sister kingdom. When
Andrew Fairservice (whom, by the way, the Bailie could not abide) chose
to impute the accident of one of the horses casting his shoe to the
deteriorating influence of the Union, he incurred a severe rebuke from
Mr. Jarvie.

â€œWhisht, sir!--whisht! itâ€™s ill-scraped tongues like yours, that make
mischief atween neighbourhoods and nations. Thereâ€™s naething sae gude on
this side oâ€™ time but it might hae been better, and that may be said oâ€™
the Union. Nane were keener against it than the Glasgow folk, wiâ€™ their
rabblings and their risings, and their mobs, as they caâ€™ them now-a-days.
But itâ€™s an ill wind blaws naebody gude--Let ilka ane roose the ford as
they find it--I say let Glasgow flourish! whilk is judiciously and
elegantly putten round the townâ€™s arms, by way of by-word.--Now, since
St. Mungo catched herrings in the Clyde, what was ever like to gar us
flourish like the sugar and tobacco trade? Will onybody tell me that, and
grumble at the treaty that opened us a road west-awaâ€™ yonder?â€

Andrew Fairservice was far from acquiescing in these arguments of
expedience, and even ventured to enter a grumbling protest, â€œThat it was
an unco change to hae Scotlandâ€™s laws made in England; and that, for his
share, he wadna for aâ€™ the herring-barrels in Glasgow, and aâ€™ the
tobacco-casks to boot, hae gien up the riding oâ€™ the Scots Parliament, or
sent awaâ€™ our crown, and our sword, and our sceptre, and Mons Meg, to be
keepit by thae English pock-puddings in the Tower oâ€™ Lunnon.

What wad Sir William Wallace, or auld Davie Lindsay, hae said to the
Union, or them that made it?â€

The road which we travelled, while diverting the way with these
discussions, had become wild and open, as soon as we had left Glasgow a
mile or two behind us, and was growing more dreary as we advanced. Huge
continuous heaths spread before, behind, and around us, in hopeless
barrenness--now level and interspersed with swamps, green with
treacherous verdure, or sable with turf, or, as they call them in
Scotland, peat-bogs,--and now swelling into huge heavy ascents, which
wanted the dignity and form of hills, while they were still more toilsome
to the passenger. There were neither trees nor bushes to relieve the eye
from the russet livery of absolute sterility. The very heath was of that
stinted imperfect kind which has little or no flower, and affords the
coarsest and meanest covering, which, as far as my experience enables me
to judge, mother Earth is ever arrayed in. Living thing we saw none,
except occasionally a few straggling sheep of a strange diversity of
colours, as black, bluish, and orange. The sable hue predominated,
however, in their faces and legs. The very birds seemed to shun these
wastes, and no wonder, since they had an easy method of escaping from
them;--at least I only heard the monotonous and plaintive cries of the
lapwing and curlew, which my companions denominated the peasweep and
whaup.

At dinner, however, which we took about noon, at a most miserable
alehouse, we had the good fortune to find that these tiresome screamers
of the morass were not the only inhabitants of the moors. The goodwife
told us, that â€œthe gudeman had been at the hill;â€ and well for us that he
had been so, for we enjoyed the produce of his _chasse_ in the shape of
some broiled moor-game,--a dish which gallantly eked out the ewe-milk
cheese, dried salmon, and oaten bread, being all besides that the house
afforded. Some very indifferent two-penny ale, and a glass of excellent
brandy, crowned our repast; and as our horses had, in the meantime,
discussed their corn, we resumed our journey with renovated vigour.

I had need of all the spirits a good dinner could give, to resist the
dejection which crept insensibly on my mind, when I combined the strange
uncertainty of my errand with the disconsolate aspect of the country
through which it was leading me. Our road continued to be, if possible,
more waste and wild than that we had travelled in the forenoon. The few
miserable hovels that showed some marks of human habitation, were now of
still rarer occurrence; and at length, as we began to ascend an
uninterrupted swell of moorland, they totally disappeared. The only
exercise which my imagination received was, when some particular turn of
the road gave us a partial view, to the left, of a large assemblage of
dark-blue mountains stretching to the north and north-west, which
promised to include within their recesses a country as wild perhaps, but
certainly differing greatly in point of interest, from that which we now
travelled. The peaks of this screen of mountains were as wildly varied
and distinguished, as the hills which we had seen on the right were tame
and lumpish; and while I gazed on this Alpine region, I felt a longing to
explore its recesses, though accompanied with toil and danger, similar to
that which a sailor feels when he wishes for the risks and animation of a
battle or a gale, in exchange for the insupportable monotony of a
protracted calm. I made various inquiries of my friend Mr. Jarvie
respecting the names and positions of these remarkable mountains; but it
was a subject on which he had no information, or did not choose to be
communicative. â€œTheyâ€™re the Hieland hills--the Hieland hills--Yeâ€™ll see
and hear eneugh about them before ye see Glasgow Cross again--I downa
look at them--I never see them but they gar me grew. Itâ€™s no for fear--no
for fear, but just for grief, for the puir blinded half-starved creatures
that inhabit them--but say nae mair about it--itâ€™s ill speaking oâ€™
Hielandmen sae near the line. I hae kenâ€™d mony an honest man wadna hae
ventured this length without he had made his last will and
testament--Mattie had ill-will to see me set awaâ€™ on this ride, and grat
awee, the sillie tawpie; but itâ€™s nae mair ferlie to see a woman greet
than to see a goose gang barefit.â€

I next attempted to lead the discourse on the character and history of
the person whom we were going to visit; but on this topic Mr. Jarvie was
totally inaccessible, owing perhaps in part to the attendance of Mr.
Andrew Fairservice, who chose to keep so close in our rear that his ears
could not fail to catch every word which was spoken, while his tongue
assumed the freedom of mingling in our conversation as often as he saw an
opportunity. For this he occasionally incurred Mr. Jarvieâ€™s reproof.

â€œKeep back, sir, as best sets ye,â€ said the Bailie, as Andrew pressed
forward to catch the answer to some question I had asked about Campbell.
--â€œye wad fain ride the fore-horse, an ye wist how.--That chieldâ€™s aye
for being out oâ€™ the cheese-fat he was moulded in.--Now, as for your
questions, Mr. Osbaldistone, now that chieldâ€™s out of ear-shot, Iâ€™ll just
tell you itâ€™s free to you to speer, and itâ€™s free to me to answer, or
no--Gude I canna say muckle oâ€™ Rob, puir chield; ill I winna say oâ€™ him,
for, forby that heâ€™s my cousin, weâ€™re coming near his ain country, and
there may be ane oâ€™ his gillies ahint every whin-bush, for what I
ken--And if yeâ€™ll be guided by my advice, the less ye speak about him, or
where we are gaun, or what we are gaun to do, weâ€™ll be the mair likely to
speed us in our errand. For itâ€™s like we may faâ€™ in wiâ€™ some oâ€™ his
unfreends--there are eâ€™en ower mony oâ€™ them about--and his bonnet sits
even on his brow yet for aâ€™ that; but I doubt theyâ€™ll be upsides wiâ€™ Rob
at the last--air day or late day, the foxâ€™s hide finds aye the flaying
knife.â€

â€œI will certainly,â€ I replied, â€œbe entirely guided by your experience.â€

â€œRight, Mr. Osbaldistone--right. But I maun speak to this gabbling skyte
too, for bairns and fules speak at the Cross what they hear at the
ingle-side.--Dâ€™ye hear, you, Andrew--whatâ€™s your name?--Fairservice!â€

Andrew, who at the last rebuff had fallen a good way behind, did not
choose to acknowledge the summons.

â€œAndrew, ye scoundrel!â€ repeated Mr. Jarvie; â€œhere, sir here!â€

â€œHere is for the dog.â€ said Andrew, coming up sulkily.

â€œIâ€™ll gie you dogâ€™s wages, ye rascal, if ye dinna attend to what I say
tâ€™ye--We are gaun into the Hielands a bitâ€--

â€œI judged as muckle,â€ said Andrew.

â€œHaud your peace, ye knave, and hear what I have to say till ye--We are
gaun a bit into the Hielandsâ€--

â€œYe tauld me sae already,â€ replied the incorrigible Andrew.

â€œIâ€™ll break your head,â€ said the Bailie, rising in wrath, â€œif ye dinna
haud your tongue.â€

â€œA hadden tongue,â€ replied Andrew, â€œmakes a slabbered mouth.â€

It was now necessary I should interfere, which I did by commanding
Andrew, with an authoritative tone, to be silent at his peril.

â€œI am silent,â€ said Andrew. â€œIâ€™se do aâ€™ your lawfuâ€™ bidding without a
nay-say. My puir mother used aye to tell me,

                      Be it better, be it worse,
                      Be ruled by him that has the purse.

Sae ye may eâ€™en speak as lang as ye like, baith the tane and the tither
oâ€™ you, for Andrew.â€

Mr. Jarvie took the advantage of his stopping after quoting the above
proverb, to give him the requisite instructions. â€œNow, sir, itâ€™s as
muckle as your lifeâ€™s worth--that wad be dear oâ€™ little siller, to be
sure--but it is as muckle as aâ€™ our lives are worth, if ye dinna mind
what I sae to ye. In this public whar we are gaun to, and whar it is like
we may hae to stay aâ€™ night, men oâ€™ aâ€™ clans and kindred--Hieland and
Lawland--tak up their quarters--And whiles there are mair drawn dirks
than open Bibles amang them, when the usquebaugh gets uppermost. See ye
neither meddle nor mak, nor gie nae offence wiâ€™ that clavering tongue oâ€™
yours, but keep a calm sough, and let ilka cock fight his ain battle.â€

â€œMuckle needs to tell me that,â€ said Andrew, contemptuously, â€œas if I had
never seen a Hielandman before, and kenâ€™d nae how to manage them. Nae man
alive can cuitle up Donald better than mysell--I hae bought wiâ€™ them,
sauld wiâ€™ them, eaten wiâ€™ them, drucken wiâ€™ themâ€--

â€œDid ye ever fight wiâ€™ them?â€ said Mr. Jarvie.

â€œNa, na,â€ answered Andrew, â€œI took care oâ€™ that: it wad ill hae set me,
that am an artist and half a scholar to my trade, to be fighting amang a
wheen kilted loons that dinna ken the name oâ€™ a single herb or flower in
braid Scots, let abee in the Latin tongue.â€

â€œThen,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, â€œas ye wad keep either your tongue in your
mouth, or your lugs in your head (and ye might miss them, for as saucy
members as they are), I charge ye to say nae word, gude or bad, that ye
can weel get by, to onybody that may be in the Clachan. And yeâ€™ll
specially understand that yeâ€™re no to be bleezing and blasting about your
masterâ€™s name and mine, or saying that this is Mr. Bailie Nicol Jarvie oâ€™
the Saut Market, son oâ€™ the worthy Deacon Nicol Jarvie, that aâ€™ body has
heard about; and this is Mr. Frank Osbaldistone, son of the managing
partner of the great house of Osbaldistone and Tresham, in the City.â€

â€œEneueh said,â€ answered Andrew--â€œeneueh said. What need ye think I wad be
speaking about your names for?--I hae mony things oâ€™ mair importance to
speak about, I trow.â€

â€œItâ€™s thae very things of importance that I am feared for, ye blethering
goose; ye maunna speak ony thing, gude or bad, that ye can by any
possibility help.â€

â€œIf ye dinna think me fit,â€ replied Andrew, in a huff, â€œto speak like
ither folk, gie me my wages and my board-wages, and Iâ€™se gae back to
Glasgow--Thereâ€™s smaâ€™ sorrow at our parting, as the auld mear said to the
broken cart.â€

Finding Andrewâ€™s perverseness again rising to a point which threatened to
occasion me inconvenience, I was under the necessity of explaining to
him, that he might return if he thought proper, but that in that case I
would not pay him a single farthing for his past services. The argument
_ad crumenam,_ as it has been called by jocular logicians, has weight
with the greater part of mankind, and Andrew was in that particular far
from affecting any trick of singularity. He â€œdrew in his horns,â€ to use
the Bailieâ€™s phrase, on the instant, professed no intention whatever to
disoblige, and a resolution to be guided by my commands, whatever they
might be.

Concord being thus happily restored to our small party, we continued to
pursue our journey. The road, which had ascended for six or seven English
miles, began now to descend for about the same space, through a country
which neither in fertility nor interest could boast any advantage over
that which we had passed already, and which afforded no variety, unless
when some tremendous peak of a Highland mountain appeared at a distance.
We continued, however, to ride on without pause and even when night fell
and overshadowed the desolate wilds which we traversed, we were, as I
understood from Mr. Jarvie, still three miles and a bittock distant from
the place where we were to spend the night.





CHAPTER ELEVENTH.

                          Baron of Bucklivie,
                       May the foul fiend drive ye,
                          And aâ€™ to pieces rive ye,
                          For building sic a town,
                       Where thereâ€™s neither horse meat,
                          Nor manâ€™s meat,
                       Nor a chair to sit down.
                                Scottish Popular Rhymes on a bad Inn.

The night was pleasant, and the moon afforded us good light for our
journey. Under her rays, the ground over which we passed assumed a more
interesting appearance than during the broad daylight, which discovered
the extent of its wasteness. The mingled light and shadows gave it an
interest which naturally did not belong to it; and, like the effect of a
veil flung over a plain woman, irritated our curiosity on a subject which
had in itself nothing gratifying.

The descent, however, still continued, turned, winded, left the more open
heaths, and got into steeper ravines, which promised soon to lead us to
the banks of some brook or river, and ultimately made good their presage.
We found ourselves at length on the bank of a stream, which rather
resembled one of my native English rivers than those I had hitherto seen
in Scotland. It was narrow, deep, still, and silent; although the
imperfect light, as it gleamed on its placid waters, showed also that we
were now among the lofty mountains which formed its cradle. â€œThatâ€™s the
Forth,â€ said the Bailie, with an air of reverence, which I have observed
the Scotch usually pay to their distinguished rivers. The Clyde, the
Tweed, the Forth, the Spey, are usually named by those who dwell on their
banks with a sort of respect and pride, and I have known duels occasioned
by any word of disparagement. I cannot say I have the least quarrel with
this sort of harmless enthusiasm. I received my friendâ€™s communication
with the importance which he seemed to think appertained to it. In fact,
I was not a little pleased, after so long and dull a journey, to approach
a region which promised to engage the imagination. My faithful squire,
Andrew, did not seem to be quite of the same opinion, for he received the
solemn information, â€œThat is the Forth,â€ with a â€œUmph!--an he had said
thatâ€™s the public-house, it wad hae been mair to the purpose.â€

The Forth, however, as far as the imperfect light permitted me to judge,
seemed to merit the admiration of those who claimed an interest in its
stream. A beautiful eminence of the most regular round shape, and clothed
with copsewood of hazels, mountain-ash, and dwarf-oak, intermixed with a
few magnificent old trees, which, rising above the underwood, exposed
their forked and bared branches to the silver moonshine, seemed to
protect the sources from which the river sprung. If I could trust the
tale of my companion, which, while professing to disbelieve every word of
it, he told under his breath, and with an air of something like
intimidation, this hill, so regularly formed, so richly verdant, and
garlanded with such a beautiful variety of ancient trees and thriving
copsewood, was held by the neighbourhood to contain, within its unseen
caverns, the palaces of the fairies--a race of airy beings, who formed an
intermediate class between men and demons, and who, if not positively
malignant to humanity, were yet to be avoided and feared, on account of
their capricious, vindictive, and irritable disposition.

â€œThey caâ€™ them,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, in a whisper, â€œ_Daoine Schie,_--whilk
signifies, as I understand, men of peace; meaning thereby to make their
gudewill. And we may eâ€™en as weel caâ€™ them that too, Mr. Osbaldistone,
for thereâ€™s nae gude in speaking ill oâ€™ the laird within his ain bounds.â€
 But he added presently after, on seeing one or two lights which twinkled
before us, â€œItâ€™s deceits oâ€™ Satan, after aâ€™, and I fearna to say it--for
we are near the manse now, and yonder are the lights in the Clachan of
Aberfoil.â€

I own I was well pleased at the circumstance to which Mr. Jarvie alluded;
not so much that it set his tongue at liberty, in his opinion, with all
safety to declare his real sentiments with respect to the _Daoine Schie,_
or fairies, as that it promised some hoursâ€™ repose to ourselves and our
horses, of which, after a ride of fifty miles and upwards, both stood in
some need.

We crossed the infant Forth by an old-fashioned stone bridge, very high
and very narrow. My conductor, however, informed me, that to get through
this deep and important stream, and to clear all its tributary
dependencies, the general pass from the Highlands to the southward lay by
what was called the Fords of Frew, at all times deep and difficult of
passage, and often altogether unfordable. Beneath these fords, there was
no pass of general resort until so far east as the bridge of Stirling; so
that the river of Forth forms a defensible line between the Highlands and
Lowlands of Scotland, from its source nearly to the Firth, or inlet of
the ocean, in which it terminates. The subsequent events which we
witnessed led me to recall with attention what the shrewdness of Bailie
Jarvie suggested in his proverbial expression, that â€œForth bridles the
wild Highlandman.â€

About half a mileâ€™s riding, after we crossed the bridge, placed us at the
door of the public-house where we were to pass the evening. It was a
hovel rather worse than better than that in which we had dined; but its
little windows were lighted up, voices were heard from within, and all
intimated a prospect of food and shelter, to which we were by no means
indifferent. Andrew was the first to observe that there was a peeled
willow-wand placed across the half-open door of the little inn. He hung
back and advised us not to enter. â€œFor,â€ said Andrew, â€œsome of their
chiefs and grit men are birling at the usquebaugh in by there, and dinna
want to be disturbed; and the least weâ€™ll get, if we gang ramstam in on
them, will be a broken head, to learn us better havings, if we dinna come
by the length of a cauld dirk in our wame, whilk is just as likely.â€

I looked at the Bailie, who acknowledged, in a whisper, â€œthat the gowk
had some reason for singing, ance in the year.â€

Meantime a staring half-clad wench or two came out of the inn and the
neighbouring cottages, on hearing the sound of our horsesâ€™ feet. No one
bade us welcome, nor did any one offer to take our horses, from which we
had alighted; and to our various inquiries, the hopeless response of â€œHa
niel Sassenach,â€ was the only answer we could extract. The Bailie,
however, found (in his experience) a way to make them speak English. â€œIf
I gie ye a bawbee,â€ said he to an urchin of about ten years old, with a
fragment of a tattered plaid about him, â€œwill you understand Sassenach?â€

â€œAy, ay, that will I,â€ replied the brat, in very decent English. â€œThen
gang and tell your mammy, my man, thereâ€™s twa Sassenach gentlemen come to
speak wiâ€™ her.â€

The landlady presently appeared, with a lighted piece of split fir
blazing in her hand. The turpentine in this species of torch (which is
generally dug from out the turf-bogs) makes it blaze and sparkle readily,
so that it is often used in the Highlands in lieu of candles. On this
occasion such a torch illuminated the wild and anxious features of a
female, pale, thin, and rather above the usual size, whose soiled and
ragged dress, though aided by a plaid or tartan screen, barely served the
purposes of decency, and certainly not those of comfort. Her black hair,
which escaped in uncombed elf-locks from under her coif, as well as the
strange and embarrassed look with which she regarded us, gave me the idea
of a witch disturbed in the midst of her unlawful rites. She plainly
refused to admit us into the house. We remonstrated anxiously, and
pleaded the length of our journey, the state of our horses, and the
certainty that there was not another place where we could be received
nearer than Callander, which the Bailie stated to be seven Scots miles
distant. How many these may exactly amount to in English measurement, I
have never been able to ascertain, but I think the double _ratio_ may be
pretty safely taken as a medium computation. The obdurate hostess treated
our expostulation with contempt. â€œBetter gang farther than fare waur,â€
 she said, speaking the Scottish Lowland dialect, and being indeed a
native of the Lennox district--â€œHer house was taen up wiâ€™ them wadna like
to be intruded on wiâ€™ strangers. She didna ken wha mair might be
there--red-coats, it might be, frae the garrison.â€ (These last words she
spoke under her breath, and with very strong emphasis.) â€œThe night,â€ she
said, â€œwas fair abune head--a night amang the heather wad caller our
bloods--we might sleep in our claes, as mony a gude blade does in the
scabbard--there wasna muckle flowmoss in the shaw, if we took up our
quarters right, and we might pit up our horses to the hill, naebody wad
say naething against it.â€

â€œBut, my good woman,â€ said I, while the Bailie groaned and remained
undecided, â€œit is six hours since we dined, and we have not taken a
morsel since. I am positively dying with hunger, and I have no taste for
taking up my abode supperless among these mountains of yours. I
positively must enter; and make the best apology you can to your guests
for adding a stranger or two to their number. Andrew, you will see the
horses put up.â€

The Hecate looked at me with surprise, and then ejaculated--â€œA wilfuâ€™ man
will hae his way--them that will to Cupar maun to Cupar!--To see thae
English belly-gods! he has had ae fuâ€™ meal the day already, and heâ€™ll
venture life and liberty, rather than heâ€™ll want a het supper! Set
roasted beef and pudding on the opposite side oâ€™ the pit oâ€™ Tophet, and
an Englishman will mak a spang at it--But I wash my hands oâ€™t--Follow me
sirâ€ (to Andrew), â€œand Iâ€™se show ye where to pit the beasts.â€

I own I was somewhat dismayed at my landladyâ€™s expressions, which seemed
to be ominous of some approaching danger. I did not, however, choose to
shrink back after having declared my resolution, and accordingly I boldly
entered the house; and after narrowly escaping breaking my shins over a
turf back and a salting tub, which stood on either side of the narrow
exterior passage, I opened a crazy half-decayed door, constructed not of
plank, but of wicker, and, followed by the Bailie, entered into the
principal apartment of this Scottish caravansary.

The interior presented a view which seemed singular enough to southern
eyes. The fire, fed with blazing turf and branches of dried wood, blazed
merrily in the centre; but the smoke, having no means to escape but
through a hole in the roof, eddied round the rafters of the cottage, and
hung in sable folds at the height of about five feet from the floor. The
space beneath was kept pretty clear by innumerable currents of air which
rushed towards the fire from the broken panel of basket-work which served
as a door--from two square holes, designed as ostensible windows, through
one of which was thrust a plaid, and through the other a tattered
great-coat--and moreover, through various less distinguishable apertures
in the walls of the tenement, which, being built of round stones and
turf, cemented by mud, let in the atmosphere at innumerable crevices.

At an old oaken table, adjoining to the fire, sat three men, guests
apparently, whom it was impossible to regard with indifference. Two were
in the Highland dress; the one, a little dark-complexioned man, with a
lively, quick, and irritable expression of features, wore the trews, or
close pantaloons wove out of a sort of chequered stocking stuff. The
Bailie whispered me, that â€œhe behoved to be a man of some consequence,
for that naebody but their Duinheâ€™wassels wore the trews--they were ill
to weave exactly to their Highland pleasure.â€

The other mountaineer was a very tall, strong man, with a quantity of
reddish hair, freckled face, high cheek-bones, and long chin--a sort of
caricature of the national features of Scotland. The tartan which he wore
differed from that of his companion, as it had much more scarlet in it,
whereas the shades of black and dark-green predominated in the chequers
of the other. The third, who sate at the same table, was in the Lowland
dress,--a bold, stout-looking man, with a cast of military daring in his
eye and manner, his riding-dress showily and profusely laced, and his
cocked hat of formidable dimensions. His hanger and a pair of pistols lay
on the table before him. Each of the Highlanders had their naked dirks
stuck upright in the board beside him,--an emblem, I was afterwards
informed, but surely a strange one, that their computation was not to be
interrupted by any brawl. A mighty pewter measure, containing about an
English quart of usquebaugh, a liquor nearly as strong as brandy, which
the Highlanders distil from malt, and drink undiluted in excessive
quantities, was placed before these worthies. A broken glass, with a
wooden foot, served as a drinking cup to the whole party, and circulated
with a rapidity, which, considering the potency of the liquor, seemed
absolutely marvellous. These men spoke loudly and eagerly together,
sometimes in Gaelic, at other times in English. Another Highlander, wrapt
in his plaid, reclined on the floor, his head resting on a stone, from
which it was only separated by a wisp of straw, and slept or seemed to
sleep, without attending to what was going on around him. He also was
probably a stranger, for he lay in full dress, and accoutred with the
sword and target, the usual arms of his countrymen when on a journey.
Cribs there were of different dimensions beside the walls, formed, some
of fractured boards, some of shattered wicker-work or plaited boughs, in
which slumbered the family of the house, men, women, and children, their
places of repose only concealed by the dusky wreaths of vapour which
arose above, below, and around them.

Our entrance was made so quietly, and the carousers I have described were
so eagerly engaged in their discussions, that we escaped their notice for
a minute or two. But I observed the Highlander who lay beside the fire
raise himself on his elbow as we entered, and, drawing his plaid over the
lower part of his face, fix his look on us for a few seconds, after which
he resumed his recumbent posture, and seemed again to betake himself to
the repose which our entrance had interrupted,

We advanced to the fire, which was an agreeable spectacle after our late
ride, during the chillness of an autumn evening among the mountains, and
first attracted the attention of the guests who had preceded us, by
calling for the landlady. She approached, looking doubtfully and timidly,
now at us, now at the other party, and returned a hesitating and doubtful
answer to our request to have something to eat.

â€œShe didna ken,â€ she said, â€œshe wasna sure there was onything in the
house,â€ and then modified her refusal with the qualification--â€œthat is,
onything fit for the like of us.â€

I assured her we were indifferent to the quality of our supper; and
looking round for the means of accommodation, which were not easily to be
found, I arranged an old hen-coop as a seat for Mr. Jarvie, and turned
down a broken tub to serve for my own. Andrew Fairservice entered
presently afterwards, and took a place in silence behind our backs. The
natives, as I may call them, continued staring at us with an air as if
confounded by our assurance, and we, at least I myself, disguised as well
as we could, under an appearance of indifference, any secret anxiety we
might feel concerning the mode in which we were to be received by those
whose privacy we had disturbed.

At length, the lesser Highlander, addressing himself to me said, in very
good English, and in a tone of great haughtiness, â€œYe make yourself at
home, sir, I see.â€

â€œI usually do so,â€ I replied, â€œwhen I come into a house of public
entertainment.â€

â€œAnd did she na see,â€ said the taller man, â€œby the white wand at the
door, that gentlemans had taken up the public-house on their ain
business?â€

â€œI do not pretend to understand the customs of this country but I am yet
to learn,â€ I replied, â€œhow three persons should be entitled to exclude
all other travellers from the only place of shelter and refreshment for
miles round.â€

â€œThereâ€™s nae reason forâ€™t, gentlemen,â€ said the Bailie; â€œwe mean nae
offence--but thereâ€™s neither law nor reason forâ€™t; but as far as a stoup
oâ€™ gude brandy wad make up the quarrel, we, being peaceable folk, wad be
willing.â€

â€œDamn your brandy, sir!â€ said the Lowlander, adjusting his cocked hat
fiercely upon his head; â€œwe desire neither your brandy nor your company,â€
 and up he rose from his seat. His companions also arose, muttering to
each other, drawing up their plaids, and snorting and snuffing the air
after the mariner of their countrymen when working themselves into a
passion.

â€œI tauld ye what wad come, gentlemen,â€ said the landlady, â€œan ye wad hae
been tauld:--get awaâ€™ wiâ€™ ye out oâ€™ my house, and make nae disturbance
here--thereâ€™s nae gentleman be disturbed at Jeanie MacAlpineâ€™s an she can
hinder. A wheen idle English loons, gaun about the country under cloud oâ€™
night, and disturbing honest peaceable gentlemen that are drinking their
drap drink at the fireside!â€

At another time I should have thought of the old Latin adage,


â€œDat veniam corvis, vexat censure columbasâ€--

But I had not any time for classical quotation, for there was obviously a
fray about to ensue, at which, feeling myself indiginant at the
inhospitable insolence with which I was treated, I was totally
indifferent, unless on the Bailieâ€™s account, whose person and qualities
were ill qualified for such an adventure. I started up, however, on
seeing the others rise, and dropped my cloak from my shoulders, that I
might be ready to stand on the defensive.

â€œWe are three to three,â€ said the lesser Highlander, glancing his eyes at
our party: â€œif ye be pretty men, draw!â€ and unsheathing his broadsword,
he advanced on me. I put myself in a posture of defence, and aware of the
superiority of my weapon, a rapier or small-sword, was little afraid of
the issue of the contest. The Bailie behaved with unexpected mettle. As
he saw the gigantic Highlander confront him with his weapon drawn, he
tugged for a second or two at the hilt of his _shabble,_ as he called it;
but finding it loth to quit the sheath, to which it had long been secured
by rust and disuse, he seized, as a substitute, on the red-hot coulter of
a plough which had been employed in arranging the fire by way of a poker,
and brandished it with such effect, that at the first pass he set the
Highlanderâ€™s plaid on fire, and compelled him to keep a respectful
distance till he could get it extinguished. Andrew, on the contrary, who
ought to have faced the Lowland champion, had, I grieve to say it,
vanished at the very commencement of the fray. But his antagonist, crying
â€œFair play, fair play!â€ seemed courteously disposed to take no share in
the scuffle. Thus we commenced our rencontre on fair terms as to numbers.
My own aim was, to possess myself, if possible, of my antagonistâ€™s
weapon; but I was deterred from closing, for fear of the dirk which he
held in his left hand, and used in parrying the thrusts of my rapier.
Meantime the Bailie, notwithstanding the success of his first onset, was
sorely bested. The weight of his weapon, the corpulence of his person,
the very effervescence of his own passions, were rapidly exhausting both
his strength and his breath, and he was almost at the mercy of his
antagonist, when up started the sleeping Highlander from the floor on
which he reclined, with his naked sword and target in his hand, and threw
himself between the discomfited magistrate and his assailant, exclaiming,
â€œHer nainsell has eaten the town pread at the Cross oâ€™ Glasgow, and py
her troth sheâ€™ll fight for Bailie Sharvie at the Clachan of Aberfoil--tat
will she eâ€™en!â€ And seconding his words with deeds, this unexpected
auxiliary made his sword whistle about the ears of his tall countryman,
who, nothing abashed, returned his blows with interest. But being both
accoutred with round targets made of wood, studded with brass, and
covered with leather, with which they readily parried each otherâ€™s
strokes, their combat was attended with much more noise and clatter than
serious risk of damage. It appeared, indeed, that there was more of
bravado than of serious attempt to do us any injury; for the Lowland
gentleman, who, as I mentioned, had stood aside for want of an antagonist
when the brawl commenced, was now pleased to act the part of moderator
and peacemaker.


â€œHand your hands! haud your hands!--eneugh done!--eneugh done! the
quarrelâ€™s no mortal. The strange gentlemen have shown themselves men of
honour, and gien reasonable satisfaction. Iâ€™ll stand on mine honour as
kittle as ony man, but I hate unnecessary bloodshed.â€

It was not, of course, my wish to protract the fray--my adversary seemed
equally disposed to sheathe his sword--the Bailie, gasping for breath,
might be considered as _hors de combat,_ and our two sword-and-buckler
men gave up their contest with as much indifference as they had entered
into it.

â€œAnd now,â€ said the worthy gentleman who acted as umpire, â€œlet us drink
and gree like honest fellows--The house will haud us aâ€™. I propose that
this good little gentleman, that seems sair forfoughen, as I may say, in
this tuilzie, shall send for a tass oâ€™ brandy and Iâ€™ll pay for another,
by way of archilowe, and then weâ€™ll birl our bawbees aâ€™ round about,
like brethren.â€

â€œAnd faâ€™s to pay my new ponnie plaid,â€ said the larger Highlander, â€œwiâ€™ a
hole burnt inâ€™t ane might put a kail-pat through? Saw ever onybody a
decent gentleman fight wiâ€™ a firebrand before?â€

â€œLet that be nae hinderance,â€ said the Bailie, who had now recovered his
breath, and was at once disposed to enjoy the triumph of having behaved
with spirit, and avoid the necessity of again resorting to such hard and
doubtful arbitrament--â€œGin I hae broken the head,â€ he said, â€œI sall find
the plaister. A new plaid sall ye hae, and oâ€™ the best--your ain
clan-colours, man,--an ye will tell me where it can be sent tâ€™ye frae
Glasco.â€

â€œI needna name my clan--I am of a kingâ€™s clan, as is weel kenâ€™d,â€ said
the Highlander; â€œbut ye may tak a bit oâ€™ the plaid--figh! she smells like
a singit sheepâ€™s head!--and thatâ€™ll learn ye the sett--and a gentleman,
thatâ€™s a cousin oâ€™ my ain, that carries eggs doun frae Glencroe, will caâ€™
forâ€™t about Martimas, an ye will tell her where ye bide. But, honest
gentleman, neist time ye fight, an ye hae ony respect for your
athversary, let it be wiâ€™ your sword, man, since ye wear ane, and no wiâ€™
thae het culters and fireprands, like a wild Indian.â€

â€œConscience!â€ replied the Bailie, â€œevery man maun do as he dow. My sword
hasna seen the light since Bothwell Brigg, when my father thatâ€™s dead and
gane, ware it; and I kenna weel if it was forthcoming then either, for
the battle was oâ€™ the briefest--At ony rate, itâ€™s glued to the scabbard
now beyond my power to part them; and, finding that, I eâ€™en grippit at
the first thing I could make a fend wiâ€™. I trow my fighting days is done,
though I like ill to take the scorn, for aâ€™ that.--But whereâ€™s the honest
lad that tuik my quarrel on himself sae frankly?--Iâ€™se bestow a gill oâ€™
aquavitae on him, an I suld never caâ€™ for anither.â€

The champion for whom he looked around was, however, no longer to be
seen. He had escaped unobserved by the Bailie, immediately when the brawl
was ended, yet not before I had recognised, in his wild features and
shaggy red hair, our acquaintance Dougal, the fugitive turnkey of the
Glasgow jail. I communicated this observation in a whisper to the Bailie,
who answered in the same tone, â€œWeel, weel,--I see that him that ye ken
oâ€™ said very right; there _is_ some glimmering oâ€™ common sense about that
creature Dougal; I maun see and think oâ€™ something will do him some
gude.â€

Thus saying, he sat down, and fetching one or two deep aspirations, by
way of recovering his breath, called to the landlady--â€œI think, Luckie,
now that I find that thereâ€™s nae hole in my wame, whilk I had muckle
reason to doubt frae the doings oâ€™ your house, I wad be the better oâ€™
something to pit intillâ€™t.â€

The dame, who was all officiousness so soon as the storm had blown over,
immediately undertook to broil something comfortable for our supper.
Indeed, nothing surprised me more, in the course of the whole matter,
than the extreme calmness with which she and her household seemed to
regard the martial tumult that had taken place. The good woman was only
heard to call to some of her assistants--â€œSteek the door! steek the door!
kill or be killed, let naebody pass out till they hae paid the lawin.â€
 And as for the slumberers in those lairs by the wall, which served the
family for beds, they only raised their shirtless bodies to look at the
fray, ejaculated, â€œOigh! oigh!â€ in the tone suitable to their respective
sex and ages, and were, I believe, fast asleep again, ere our swords were
well returned to their scabbards.

Our landlady, however, now made a great bustle to get some victuals
ready, and, to my surprise, very soon began to prepare for us in the
frying-pan a savoury mess of venison collops, which she dressed in a
manner that might well satisfy hungry men, if not epicures. In the
meantime the brandy was placed on the table, to which the Highlanders,
however partial to their native strong waters, showed no objection, but
much the contrary; and the Lowland gentleman, after the first cup had
passed round, became desirous to know our profession, and the object of
our journey.

â€œWe are bits oâ€™ Glasgow bodies, if it please your honour,â€ said the
Bailie, with an affectation of great humility, â€œtravelling to Stirling to
get in some siller that is awing us.â€

I was so silly as to feel a little disconcerted at the unassuming account
which he chose to give of us; but I recollected my promise to be silent,
and allow the Bailie to manage the matter his own way. And really, when I
recollected, Will, that I had not only brought the honest man a long
journey from home, which even in itself had been some inconvenience (if I
were to judge from the obvious pain and reluctance with which he took his
seat, or arose from it), but had also put him within a hairâ€™s-breadth of
the loss of his life, I could hardly refuse him such a compliment. The
spokesman of the other party, snuffing up his breath through his nose,
repeated the words with a sort of sneer;--â€œYou Glasgow tradesfolks hae
naething to do but to gang frae the tae end oâ€™ the west oâ€™ Scotland to
the ither, to plague honest folks that may chance to be awee ahint the
hand, like me.â€

â€œIf our debtors were aâ€™ sic honest gentlemen as I believe you to be,
Garschattachin,â€ replied the Bailie, â€œconscience! we might save ourselves
a labour, for they wad come to seek us.â€

â€œEh! what! how!â€ exclaimed the person whom he had addressed,--â€œas I shall
live by bread (not forgetting beef and brandy), itâ€™s my auld friend Nicol
Jarvie, the best man that ever counted doun merks on a band till a
distressed gentleman. Were ye na coming up my way?--were ye na coming up
the Endrick to Garschattachin?â€

â€œTroth no, Maister Galbraith,â€ replied the Bailie, â€œI had other eggs on
the spit--and I thought ye wad be saying I cam to look about the annual
rent thatâ€™s due on the bit heritable band thatâ€™s between us.â€

â€œDamn the annual rent!â€ said the laird, with an appearance of great
heartiness--â€œDeil a word oâ€™ business will you or I speak, now that yeâ€™re
so near my country. To see how a trot-cosey and a joseph can disguise a
man--that I suldna ken my auld feal friend the deacon!â€

â€œThe Bailie, if ye please,â€ resumed my companion; â€œbut I ken what gars ye
mistak--the band was granted to my father thatâ€™s happy, and he was
deacon; but his name was Nicol as weel as mine. I dinna mind that thereâ€™s
been a payment of principal sum or annual rent on it in my day, and
doubtless that has made the mistake.â€

â€œWeel, the devil take the mistake and all that occasioned it!â€ replied
Mr. Galbraith. â€œBut I am glad ye are a bailie. Gentlemen, fill a
brimmer--this is my excellent friend, Bailie Nicol Jarvieâ€™s health--I
kenâ€™d him and his father these twenty years. Are ye aâ€™ cleared kelty
aff?--Fill anither. Hereâ€™s to his being sune provost--I say
provost--Lord Provost Nicol Jarvie!--and them that affirms thereâ€™s a man
walks the Hie-street oâ€™ Glasgow thatâ€™s fitter for the office, they will
do weel not to let me, Duncan Galbraith of Garschattachin, hear them say
sae--thatâ€™s all.â€ And therewith Duncan Galbraith martially cocked his
hat, and placed it on one side of his head with an air of defiance.

The brandy was probably the best recommendation of there complimentary
toasts to the two Highlanders, who drank them without appearing anxious
to comprehend their purport. They commenced a conversation with Mr.
Galbraith in Gaelic, which he talked with perfect fluency, being, as I
afterwards learned, a near neighbour to the Highlands.

â€œI kenâ€™d that Scant-oâ€™-grace weel eneugh frae the very outset,â€ said the
Bailie, in a whisper to me; â€œbut when blude was warm, and swords were out
at ony rate, wha kens what way he might hae thought oâ€™ paying his debts?
it will be lang or he does it in common form. But heâ€™s an honest lad, and
has a warm heart too; he disna come often to the Cross oâ€™ Glasgow, but
mony a buck and blackcock he sends us doun frae the hills. And I can want
my siller weel eneugh. My father the deacon had a great regard for the
family of Garschattachin.â€

Supper being now nearly ready, I looked round for Andrew Fairservice; but
that trusty follower had not been seen by any one since the beginning of
the rencontre. The hostess, however, said that she believed our servant
had gone into the stable, and offered to light me to the place, saying
that â€œno entreaties of the bairns or hers could make him give any answer;
and that truly she caredna to gang into the stable herself at this hour.
She was a lone woman, and it was weel kenâ€™d how the Brownie of
Ben-ye-gask guided the gudewife of Ardnagowan; and it was aye judged
there was a Brownie in our stable, which was just what garrâ€™d me gie ower
keeping an hostler.â€

As, however, she lighted me towards the miserable hovel into which they
had crammed our unlucky steeds, to regale themselves on hay, every fibre
of which was as thick as an ordinary goose-quill, she plainly showed me
that she had another reason for drawing me aside from the company than
that which her words implied. â€œRead that,â€ she said, slipping a piece of
paper into my hand, as we arrived at the door of the shed; â€œI bless God I
am rid oâ€™t. Between sogers and Saxons, and caterans and cattle-lifters,
and hership and bluidshed, an honest woman wad live quieter in hell than
on the Hieland line.â€

So saying, she put the pine-torch into my hand, and returned into the
house,




CHAPTER TWELFTH.


              Bagpipes, not lyres, the Highland hills adorn,
              MacLeanâ€™s loud hollo, and MacGregorâ€™s horn.

I stopped in the entrance of the stable, if indeed a place be entitled to
that name where horses were stowed away along with goats, poultry, pigs,
and cows, under the same roof with the mansion-house; although, by a
degree of refinement unknown to the rest of the hamlet, and which I
afterwards heard was imputed to an overpride on the part of Jeanie
MacAlpine, our landlady, the apartment was accommodated with an entrance
different from that used by her biped customers. By the light of my
torch, I deciphered the following billet, written on a wet, crumpled, and
dirty piece of paper, and addressed--â€œFor the honoured hands of Mr. F.
O., a Saxon young gentleman--These.â€ The contents were as follows:--

â€œSir,

â€œThere are night-hawks abroad, so that I cannot give you and my respected
kinsman, B. N. J., the meeting at the Clachan of Aberfoil, whilk was my
purpose. I pray you to avoid unnecessary communication with those you may
find there, as it may give future trouble. The person who gives you this
is faithful and may be trusted, and will guide you to a place where, God
willing, I may safely give you the meeting, when I trust my kinsman and
you will visit my poor house, where, in despite of my enemies, I can
still promise sic cheer as ane Hielandman may gie his friends, and where
we will drink a solemn health to a certain D. V., and look to certain
affairs whilk I hope to be your aidance in; and I rest, as is wont among
gentlemen,

your servant to command,
R. M. C.â€


I was a good deal mortified at the purport of this letter, which seemed
to adjourn to a more distant place and date the service which I had hoped
to receive from this man Campbell. Still, however, it was some comfort to
know that he continued to be in my interest, since without him I could
have no hope of recovering my fatherâ€™s papers. I resolved, therefore, to
obey his instructions; and, observing all caution before the guests, to
take the first good opportunity I could find to procure from the landlady
directions how I was to obtain a meeting with this mysterious person.

My next business was to seek out Andrew Fairservice, whom I called
several times by name, without receiving any answer, surveying the stable
all round, at the same time, not without risk of setting the premises on
fire, had not the quantity of wet litter and mud so greatly
counterbalanced two or three bunches of straw and hay. At length my
repeated cries of â€œAndrew Fairservice! Andrew! fool!--ass! where are
you?â€ produced a doleful â€œHere,â€ in a groaning tone, which might have
been that of the Brownie itself. Guided by this sound, I advanced to the
corner of a shed, where, ensconced in the angle of the wall, behind a
barrel full of the feathers of all the fowls which had died in the cause
of the public for a month past, I found the manful Andrew; and partly by
force, partly by command and exhortation, compelled him forth into the
open air. The first words he spoke were, â€œI am an honest lad, sir.â€

â€œWho the devil questions your honesty?â€ said I, â€œor what have we to do
with it at present? I desire you to come and attend us at supper.â€

â€œYes,â€ reiterated Andrew, without apparently understanding what I said to
him, â€œI am an honest lad, whatever the Bailie may say to the contrary. I
grant the warld and the warldâ€™s gear sits ower near my heart whiles, as
it does to mony a ane--But I am an honest lad; and, though I spak oâ€™
leaving ye in the muir, yet God knows it was far frae my purpose, but
just like idle things folk says when theyâ€™re driving a bargain, to get it
as far to their ain side as they can--And I like your honour weel for sae
young a lad, and I wadna part wiâ€™ ye lightly.â€

â€œWhat the deuce are you driving at now?â€ I replied. â€œHas not everything
been settled again and again to your satisfaction? And are you to talk of
leaving me every hour, without either rhyme or reason?â€

â€œAy,--but I was only making fashion before,â€ replied Andrew; â€œbut itâ€™s
come on me in sair earnest now--Lose or win, I daur gae nae farther wiâ€™
your honour; and if yeâ€™ll tak my foolish advice, yeâ€™ll bide by a broken
tryste, rather than gang forward yoursell. I hae a sincere regard for ye,
and Iâ€™m sure yeâ€™ll be a credit to your friends if ye live to saw out your
wild aits, and get some mair sense and steadiness--But I can follow ye
nae farther, even if ye suld founder and perish from the way for lack of
guidance and counsel. To gang into Rob Royâ€™s country is a mere tempting
oâ€™ Providence.â€

â€œRob Roy?â€ said I, in some surprise; â€œI know no such person. What new
trick is this, Andrew?â€

â€œItâ€™s hard,â€ said Andrew--â€œvery hard, that a man canna be believed when
he speaks Heavenâ€™s truth, just because heâ€™s whiles owercome, and tells
lees a little when there is necessary occasion. Ye needna ask whae Rob
Roy is, the reiving lifter that he is--God forgie me! I hope naebody
hears us--when ye hae a letter frae him in your pouch. I heard ane oâ€™ his
gillies bid that auld rudas jaud of a gudewife gie ye that. They thought
I didna understand their gibberish; but, though I canna speak it muckle,
I can gie a gude guess at what I hear them say--I never thought to hae
tauld ye that, but in a fright aâ€™ things come out that suld be keepit in.
O, Maister Frank! aâ€™ your uncleâ€™s follies, and aâ€™ your cousinâ€™s pliskies,
were naething to this! Drink clean cap out, like Sir Hildebrand; begin
the blessed morning with brandy sops, like Squire Percy; swagger, like
Squire Thorncliff; rin wud amang the lasses, like Squire John; gamble,
like Richard; win souls to the Pope and the deevil, like Rashleigh; rive,
rant, break the Sabbath, and do the Popeâ€™s bidding, like them aâ€™ put
thegither--But, merciful Providence! take care oâ€™ your young bluid, and
gang nae near Rob Roy!â€

Andrewâ€™s alarm was too sincere to permit me to suppose he counterfeited.
I contented myself, however, with telling him, that I meant to remain in
the alehouse that night, and desired to have the horses well looked
after. As to the rest, I charged him to observe the strictest silence
upon the subject of his alarm, and he might rely upon it I would not
incur any serious danger without due precaution. He followed me with a
dejected air into the house, observing between his teeth, â€œMan suld be
served afore beast--I haena had a morsel in my mouth, but the rough legs
oâ€™ that auld muircock, this haill blessed day.â€

The harmony of the company seemed to have suffered some interruption
since my departure, for I found Mr. Galbraith and my friend the Bailie
high in dispute.

â€œIâ€™ll hear nae sic language,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, as I entered, â€œrespecting
the Duke oâ€™ Argyle and the name oâ€™ Campbell. Heâ€™s a worthy
public-spirited nobleman, and a credit to the country, and a friend and
benefactor to the trade oâ€™ Glasgow.â€

â€œIâ€™ll sae naething against MacCallum More and the Slioch-nan-Diarmid,â€
 said the lesser Highlander, laughing. â€œI live on the wrang side of
Glencroe to quarrel with Inverara.â€

â€œOur loch neâ€™er saw the Cawmil lymphads,â€ said the bigger Highlander.

â€œSheâ€™ll speak her mind and fear naebody--She doesna value a Cawmil mair
as a Cowan, and ye may tell MacCallum More that Allan Iverach said sae--
Itâ€™s a far cry to Lochow.â€ 

Mr. Galbraith, on whom the repeated pledges which he had quaffed had
produced some influence, slapped his hand on the table with great force,
and said, in a stern voice, â€œThereâ€™s a bloody debt due by that family,
and they will pay it one day--The banes of a loyal and a gallant Grahame
hae lang rattled in their coffin for vengeance on thae Dukes of Guile and
Lords for Lorn. There neâ€™er was treason in Scotland but a Cawmil was at
the bottom oâ€™t; and now that the wrang sideâ€™s uppermost, wha but the
Cawmils for keeping down the right? But this warld winna last lang, and
it will be time to sharp the maiden for shearing oâ€™ craigs and
thrapples. I hope to see the auld rusty lass linking at a bluidy harst
again.â€

â€œFor shame, Garschattachin!â€ exclaimed the Bailie; â€œfy for shame, sir!
Wad ye say sic things before a magistrate, and bring yoursell into
trouble?--How dâ€™ye think to mainteen your family and satisfy your
creditors (mysell and others), if ye gang on in that wild way, which
cannot but bring you under the law, to the prejudice of aâ€™ thatâ€™s
connected wiâ€™ ye?â€

â€œD--n my creditors!â€ retorted the gallant Galbraith, â€œand you if ye be
ane oâ€™ them! I say there will be a new warld sune--And we shall hae nae
Cawmils cocking their bonnet sae hie, and hounding their dogs where they
daurna come themsells, nor protecting thieves, nor murderers, and
oppressors, to harry and spoil better men and mair loyal clans than
themsells.â€

The Bailie had a great mind to have continued the dispute, when the
savoury vapour of the broiled venison, which our landlady now placed
before us, proved so powerful a mediator, that he betook himself to his
trencher with great eagerness, leaving the strangers to carry on the
dispute among themselves.

â€œAnd tatâ€™s true,â€ said the taller Highlander--whose name I found was
Stewart--â€œfor we suldna be plagued and worried here wiâ€™ meetings to pit
down Rob Roy, if the Cawmils didna gie him refutch. I was ane oâ€™ thirty
oâ€™ my ain name--part Glenfinlas, and part men that came down frae Appine.
We shased the MacGregors as ye wad shase rae-deer, till we came into
Glenfallochâ€™s country, and the Cawmils raise, and wadna let us pursue nae
farder, and sae we lost our labour; but her wad gie twa and a plack to be
as near Rob as she was tat day.â€

It seemed to happen very unfortunately, that in every topic of discourse
which these warlike gentlemen introduced, my friend the Bailie found some
matter of offence. â€œYeâ€™ll forgie me speaking my mind, sir; but ye wad
maybe hae gien the best bowl in your bonnet to hae been as far awae frae
Rob as ye are eâ€™en now--Od! my het pleugh-culter wad hae been naething to
his claymore.â€

â€œShe had better speak nae mair about her culter, or, by G--! her will gar
her eat her words, and twa handfuls oâ€™ cauld steel to drive them ower
wiâ€™!â€ And, with a most inauspicious and menacing look, the mountaineer
laid his hand on his dagger.

â€œWeâ€™ll hae nae quarrelling, Allan,â€ said his shorter companion; â€œand if
the Glasgow gentleman has ony regard for Rob Roy, heâ€™ll maybe see him in
cauld irons the night, and playing tricks on a tow the morn; for this
country has been owre lang plagued wiâ€™ him, and his race is near-hand
run--And itâ€™s time, Allan, we were ganging to our lads.â€

â€œHout awa, Inverashalloch,â€ said Galbraith;--â€œMind the auld saw, man--
Itâ€™s a bauld moon, quoth Bennygask--another pint, quoth Lesley;--weâ€™ll no
start for another chappin.â€

â€œI hae had chappins eneugh,â€ said Inverashalloch; â€œIâ€™ll drink my quart of
usquebaugh or brandy wiâ€™ ony honest fellow, but the deil a drap mair when
I hae wark to do in the morning. And, in my puir thinking,
Garschattachin, ye had better be thinking to bring up your horsemen to
the Clachan before day, that we may ay start fair.â€

â€œWhat the deevil are ye in sic a hurry for?â€ said Garschattachin; â€œmeat
and mass never hindered wark. An it had been my directing, deil a bit oâ€™
me wad hae fashed ye to come down the glens to help us. The garrison and
our ain horse could hae taen Rob Roy easily enough. Thereâ€™s the hand,â€ he
said, holding up his own, â€œshould lay him on the green, and never ask a
Hielandman oâ€™ ye aâ€™ for his help.â€

â€œYe might hae loot us bide still where we were, then,â€ said
Inverashalloch. â€œI didna come sixty miles without being sent for. But an
yeâ€™ll hae my opinion, I redd ye keep your mouth better steekit, if ye
hope to speed. Shored folk live lang, and sae may him ye ken oâ€™. The way
to catch a bird is no to fling your bannet at her. And also thae
gentlemen hae heard some things they suldna hae heard, an the brandy
hadna been ower bauld for your brain, Major Galbraith. Ye needna cock
your hat and bully wiâ€™ me, man, for I will not bear it.â€

â€œI hae said it,â€ said Galbraith, with a solemn air of drunken gravity,
â€œthat I will quarrel no more this night either with broadcloth or tartan.
When I am off duty Iâ€™ll quarrel with you or ony man in the Hielands or
Lowlands, but not on duty--no--no. I wish we heard oâ€™ these red-coats. If
it had been to do onything against King James, we wad hae seen them lang
syne--but when itâ€™s to keep the peace oâ€™ the country they can lie as
lound as their neighbours.â€

As he spoke we heard the measured footsteps of a body of infantry on the
march; and an officer, followed by two or three files of soldiers,
entered the apartment. He spoke in an English accent, which was very
pleasant to my ears, now so long accustomed to the varying brogue of the
Highland and Lowland Scotch.--â€œYou are, I suppose, Major Galbraith, of
the squadron of Lennox Militia, and these are the two Highland gentlemen
with whom I was appointed to meet in this place?â€

They assented, and invited the officer to take some refreshments, which
he declined.--â€œI have been too late, gentlemen, and am desirous to make
up time. I have orders to search for and arrest two persons guilty of
treasonable practices.â€

â€œWeâ€™ll wash our hands oâ€™ that,â€ said Inverashalloch. â€œI came here wiâ€™ my
men to fight against the red MacGregor that killed my cousin, seven times
removed, Duncan MacLaren, in Invernenty; but I will hae nothing to do
touching honest gentlemen that may be gaun through the country on their
ain business.â€

â€œNor I neither,â€ said Iverach.

Major Galbraith took up the matter more solemnly, and, premising his
oration with a hiccup, spoke to the following purpose:--

â€œI shall say nothing against King George, Captain, because, as it
happens, my commission may rin in his name--But one commission being
good, sir, does not make another bad; and some think that James may be
just as good a name as George. Thereâ€™s the king that is--and thereâ€™s the
king that suld of right be--I say, an honest man may and suld be loyal to
them both, Captain. But I am of the Lord Lieutenantâ€™s opinion for the
time, as it becomes a militia officer and a depute-lieutenant--and about
treason and all that, itâ€™s lost time to speak of it--least said is sunest
mended.â€

â€œI am sorry to see how you have been employing your time, sir,â€ replied
the English officer--as indeed the honest gentlemanâ€™s reasoning had a
strong relish of the liquor he had been drinking--â€œand I could wish, sir,
it had been otherwise on an occasion of this consequence. I would
recommend to you to try to sleep for an hour.--Do these gentlemen belong
to your party?â€--looking at the Bailie and me, who, engaged in eating our
supper, had paid little attention to the officer on his entrance.

â€œTravellers, sir,â€ said Galbraith--â€œlawful travellers by sea and land, as
the prayer-book hath it.â€

â€œMy instructions.â€ said the Captain, taking a light to survey us closer,
â€œare to place under arrest an elderly and a young person--and I think
these gentlemen answer nearly the description.â€

â€œTake care what you say, sir,â€ said Mr. Jarvie; â€œit shall not be your red
coat nor your laced hat shall protect you, if you put any affront on me.
Iâ€™se convene ye baith in an action of scandal and false imprisonment--I
am a free burgess and a magistrate oâ€™ Glasgow; Nicol Jarvie is my name,
sae was my fatherâ€™s afore me--I am a bailie, be praised for the honour,
and my father was a deacon.â€

â€œHe was a prick-eared cur,â€ said Major Galbraith, â€œand fought agane the
King at Bothwell Brigg.â€

â€œHe paid what he ought and what he bought, Mr. Galbraith,â€ said the
Bailie, â€œand was an honester man than ever stude on your shanks.â€

â€œI have no time to attend to all this,â€ said the officer; â€œI must
positively detain you, gentlemen, unless you can produce some respectable
security that you are loyal subjects.â€

â€œI desire to be carried before some civil magistrate,â€ said the
Bailie--â€œthe sherra or the judge of the bounds;--I am not obliged to
answer every red-coat that speers questions at me.â€

â€œWell, sir, I shall know how to manage you if you are silent--And you,
sirâ€ (to me), â€œwhat may your name be?â€

â€œFrancis Osbaldistone, sir.â€

â€œWhat, a son of Sir Hildebrand Osbaldistone of Northumberland?â€

â€œNo, sir,â€ interrupted the Bailie; â€œa son of the great William
Osbaldistone of the House of Osbaldistone and Tresham, Crane-Alley,
London.â€

â€œI am afraid, sir,â€ said the officer, â€œyour name only increases the
suspicions against you, and lays me under the necessity of requesting
that you will give up what papers you have in charge.â€

I observed the Highlanders look anxiously at each other when this
proposal was made.

â€œI had none,â€ I replied, â€œto surrender.â€

The officer commanded me to be disarmed and searched. To have resisted
would have been madness. I accordingly gave up my arms, and submitted to
a search, which was conducted as civilly as an operation of the kind well
could. They found nothing except the note which I had received that night
through the hand of the landlady.

â€œThis is different from what I expected,â€ said the officer; â€œbut it
affords us good grounds for detaining you. Here I find you in written
communication with the outlawed robber, Robert MacGregor Campbell, who
has been so long the plague of this district--How do you account for
that?â€

â€œSpies of Rob!â€ said Inverashalloch. â€œWe wad serve them right to strap
them up till the neist tree.â€

â€œWe are gaun to see after some gear oâ€™ our ain, gentlemen,â€ said the
Bailie, â€œthatâ€™s faâ€™en into his hands by accident--thereâ€™s nae law agane a
man looking after his ain, I hope?â€

â€œHow did you come by this letter?â€ said the officer, addressing himself
to me.

I could not think of betraying the poor woman who had given it to me, and
remained silent.

â€œDo you know anything of it, fellow?â€ said the officer, looking at
Andrew, whose jaws were chattering like a pair of castanets at the
threats thrown out by the Highlander.

â€œO ay, I ken aâ€™ about it--it was a Hieland loon gied the letter to that
lang-tongued jaud the gudewife there; Iâ€™ll be sworn my maister kenâ€™d
naething about it. But heâ€™s wilfuâ€™ to gang up the hills and speak wiâ€™
Rob; and oh, sir, it wad be a charity just to send a wheen oâ€™ your
red-coats to see him safe back to Glasgow again whether he will or
no--And ye can keep Mr. Jarvie as lang as ye like--Heâ€™s responsible
enough for ony fine ye may lay on him--and soâ€™s my master for that
matter; for me, Iâ€™m just a puir gardener lad, and no worth your
steering.â€

â€œI believe,â€ said the officer, â€œthe best thing I can do is to send these
persons to the garrison under an escort. They seem to be in immediate
correspondence with the enemy, and I shall be in no respect answerable
for suffering them to be at liberty. Gentlemen, you will consider
yourselves as my prisoners. So soon as dawn approaches, I will send you
to a place of security. If you be the persons you describe yourselves, it
will soon appear, and you will sustain no great inconvenience from being
detained a day or two. I can hear no remonstrances,â€ he continued,
turning away from the Bailie, whose mouth was open to address him; â€œthe
service I am on gives me no time for idle discussions.â€

â€œAweel, aweel, sir,â€ said the Bailie, â€œyouâ€™re welcome to a tune on your
ain fiddle; but see if I dinna gar ye dance tillâ€™t afore aâ€™s dune.â€

An anxious consultation now took place between the officer and the
Highlanders, but carried on in so low a tone, that it was impossible to
catch the sense. So soon as it was concluded they all left the house. At
their departure, the Bailie thus expressed himself:--â€œThae Hielandmen are
oâ€™ the westland clans, and just as light-handed as their neighbours, an
aâ€™ tales be true, and yet ye see they hae brought them frae the head oâ€™
Argyleshire to make war wiâ€™ puir Rob for some auld ill-will that they hae
at him and his sirname. And thereâ€™s the Grahames, and the Buchanans, and
the Lennox gentry, aâ€™ mounted and in order--Itâ€™s weel kenâ€™d their
quarrel; and I dinna blame them--naebody likes to lose his kye. And then
thereâ€™s sodgers, puir things, hoyed out frae the garrison at aâ€™ bodyâ€™s
bidding--Puir Rob will hae his hands fuâ€™ by the time the sun comes ower
the hill. Weel--itâ€™s wrang for a magistrate to be wishing onything agane
the course oâ€™ justice, but deil oâ€™ me an I wad break my heart to hear
that Rob had gien them aâ€™ their paiks!â€




CHAPTER THIRTEEN.



                              --General,
                 Hear me, and mark me well, and look upon me
                 Directly in my face--my womanâ€™s face--
                 See if one fear, one shadow of a terror,
                 One paleness dare appear, but from my anger,
                       To lay hold on your mercies.
                                               Bonduca.

We were permitted to slumber out the remainder of the night in the best
manner that the miserable accommodations of the alehouse permitted. The
Bailie, fatigued with his journey and the subsequent scenes--less
interested also in the event of our arrest, which to him could only be a
matter of temporary inconvenience--perhaps less nice than habit had
rendered me about the cleanliness or decency of his couch,--tumbled
himself into one of the cribs which I have already described, and soon
was heard to snore soundly. A broken sleep, snatched by intervals, while
I rested my head upon the table, was my only refreshment. In the course
of the night I had occasion to observe that there seemed to be some doubt
and hesitation in the motions of the soldiery. Men were sent out, as if
to obtain intelligence, and returned apparently without bringing any
satisfactory information to their commanding officer. He was obviously
eager and anxious, and again despatched small parties of two or three
men, some of whom, as I could understand from what the others whispered
to each other, did not return again to the Clachan.

The morning had broken, when a corporal and two men rushed into the hut,
dragging after them, in a sort of triumph, a Highlander, whom I
immediately recognised as my acquaintance the ex-turnkey. The Bailie, who
started up at the noise with which they entered, immediately made the
same discovery, and exclaimed--â€œMercy on us! they hae grippit the puir
creature Dougal.--Captain, I will put in bail--sufficient bail, for that
Dougal creature.â€

To this offer, dictated undoubtedly by a grateful recollection of the
late interference of the Highlander in his behalf, the Captain only
answered by requesting Mr. Jarvie to â€œmind his own affairs, and remember
that he was himself for the present a prisoner.â€

â€œI take you to witness, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ said the Bailie, who was
probably better acquainted with the process in civil than in military
cases, â€œthat he has refused sufficient bail. Itâ€™s my opinion that the
creature Dougal will have a good action of wrongous imprisonment and
damages agane him, under the Act seventeen hundred and one, and Iâ€™ll see
the creature righted.â€

The officer, whose name I understood was Thornton, paying no attention to
the Bailieâ€™s threats or expostulations, instituted a very close inquiry
into Dougalâ€™s life and conversation, and compelled him to admit, though
with apparent reluctance, the successive facts,--that he knew Rob Roy
MacGregor--that he had seen him within these twelve months--within these
six months--within this month--within this week; in fine, that he had
parted from him only an hour ago. All this detail came like drops of
blood from the prisoner, and was, to all appearance, only extorted by the
threat of a halter and the next tree, which Captain Thornton assured him
should be his doom, if he did not give direct and special information.

â€œAnd now, my friend,â€ said the officer, â€œyou will please inform me how
many men your master has with him at present.â€

Dougal looked in every direction except at the querist, and began to
answer, â€œShe canna just be sure about that.â€

â€œLook at me, you Highland dog,â€ said the officer, â€œand remember your life
depends on your answer. How many rogues had that outlawed scoundrel with
him when you left him?â€

â€œOu, no aboon sax rogues when I was gane.â€

â€œAnd where are the rest of his banditti?â€

â€œGane wiâ€™ the Lieutenant agane ta westland carles.â€

â€œAgainst the westland clans?â€ said the Captain. â€œUmph--that is likely
enough; and what rogueâ€™s errand were you despatched upon?â€

â€œJust to see what your honour and ta gentlemen red-coats were doing doun
here at ta Clachan.â€

â€œThe creature will prove fause-hearted, after aâ€™,â€ said the Bailie, who
by this time had planted himself close behind me; â€œitâ€™s lucky I didna pit
mysell to expenses anent him.â€

â€œAnd now, my friend,â€ said the Captain, â€œlet us understand each other.
You have confessed yourself a spy, and should string up to the next
tree--But come, if you will do me one good turn, I will do you another.
You, Donald--you shall just, in the way of kindness, carry me and a small
party to the place where you left your master, as I wish to speak a few
words with him on serious affairs; and Iâ€™ll let you go about your
business, and give you five guineas to boot.â€

â€œOigh! oigh!â€ exclaimed Dougal, in the extremity of distress and
perplexity; â€œshe canna do tat--she canna do tat; sheâ€™ll rather be
hanged.â€

â€œHanged, then, you shall be, my friendâ€ said the officer; â€œand your blood
be upon your own head. Corporal Cramp, do you play Provost-Marshal--away
with him!â€

The corporal had confronted poor Dougal for some time, ostentatiously
twisting a piece of cord which he had found in the house into the form of
a halter. He now threw it about the culpritâ€™s neck, and, with the
assistance of two soldiers, had dragged Dougal as far as the door, when,
overcome with the terror of immediate death, he exclaimed, â€œShentlemans,
stops--stops! Sheâ€™ll do his honourâ€™s bidding--stops!â€

â€œAwaâ€™ wiâ€™ the creature!â€ said the Bailie, â€œhe deserves hanging mair now
than ever; awaâ€™ wiâ€™ him, corporal. Why dinna ye tak him awaâ€™?â€

â€œItâ€™s my belief and opinion, honest gentleman,â€ said the corporal, â€œthat
if you were going to be hanged yourself, you would be in no such d--d
hurry.â€

This by-dialogue prevented my hearing what passed between the prisoner
and Captain Thornton; but I heard the former snivel out, in a very
subdued tone, â€œAnd yeâ€™ll ask her to gang nae farther than just to show ye
where the MacGregor is?--Ohon! ohon!â€

â€œSilence your howling, you rascal--No; I give you my word I will ask you
to go no farther.--Corporal, make the men fall in, in front of the
houses. Get out these gentlemenâ€™s horses; we must carry them with us. I
cannot spare any men to guard them here. Come, my lads, get under arms.â€

The soldiers bustled about, and were ready to move. We were led out,
along with Dougal, in the capacity of prisoners. As we left the hut, I
heard our companion in captivity remind the Captain of â€œta foive
kuineas.â€

â€œHere they are for you,â€ said the officer, putting gold into his hand;
â€œbut observe, that if you attempt to mislead me, I will blow your brains
out with my own hand.â€

â€œThe creature,â€ said the Bailie, â€œis waur than I judged him--it is a
warldly and a perfidious creature. O the filthy lucre of gain that men
gies themsells up to! My father the deacon used to say, the penny siller
slew mair souls than the naked sword slew bodies.â€

The landlady now approached, and demanded payment of her reckoning,
including all that had been quaffed by Major Galbraith and his Highland
friends. The English officer remonstrated, but Mrs. MacAlpine declared,
if â€œshe hadna trusted to his honourâ€™s name being used in their company,
she wad never hae drawn them a stoup oâ€™ liquor; for Mr. Galbraith, she
might see him again, or she might no, but weel did she wot she had smaâ€™
chance of seeing her siller--and she was a puir widow, had naething but
her custom to rely on.â€

Captain Thornton put a stop to her remonstrances by paying the charge,
which was only a few English shillings, though the amount sounded very
formidable in Scottish denominations. The generous officer would have
included Mr. Jarvie and me in this general acquittance; but the Bailie,
disregarding an intimation from the landlady to â€œmake as muckle of the
Inglishers as we could, for they were sure to gie us plague eneugh,â€ went
into a formal accounting respecting our share of the reckoning, and paid
it accordingly. The Captain took the opportunity to make us some slight
apology for detaining us. â€œIf we were loyal and peaceable subjects,â€ he
said, â€œwe would not regret being stopt for a day, when it was essential
to the kingâ€™s service; if otherwise, he was acting according to his
duty.â€

We were compelled to accept an apology which it would have served no
purpose to refuse, and we sallied out to attend him on his march.

I shall never forget the delightful sensation with which I exchanged the
dark, smoky, smothering atmosphere of the Highland hut, in which we had
passed the night so uncomfortably, for the refreshing fragrance of the
morning air, and the glorious beams of the rising sun, which, from a
tabernacle of purple and golden clouds, were darted full on such a scene
of natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my eyes. To the
left lay the valley, down which the Forth wandered on its easterly
course, surrounding the beautiful detached hill, with all its garland of
woods. On the right, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls, and crags, lay
the bed of a broad mountain lake, lightly curled into tiny waves by the
breath of the morning breeze, each glittering in its course under the
influence of the sunbeams. High hills, rocks, and banks, waving with
natural forests of birch and oak, formed the borders of this enchanting
sheet of water; and, as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in
the sun, gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity. Man
alone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in a scene where all
the ordinary features of nature were raised and exalted. The miserable
little _bourocks,_ as the Bailie termed them, of which about a dozen
formed the village called the Clachan of Aberfoil, were composed of loose
stones, cemented by clay instead of mortar, and thatched by turfs, laid
rudely upon rafters formed of native and unhewn birches and oaks from the
woods around. The roofs approached the ground so nearly, that Andrew
Fairservice observed we might have ridden over the village the night
before, and never found out we were near it, unless our horsesâ€™ feet had
â€œgane through the rigginâ€™.â€

From all we could see, Mrs. MacAlpineâ€™s house, miserable as were the
quarters it afforded, was still by far the best in the hamlet; and I dare
say (if my description gives you any curiosity to see it) you will hardly
find it much improved at the present day, for the Scotch are not a people
who speedily admit innovation, even when it comes in the shape of
improvement.

The inhabitants of these miserable dwellings were disturbed by the noise
of our departure; and as our party of about twenty soldiers drew up in
rank before marching off, we were reconnoitred by many a beldam from the
half-opened door of her cottage. As these sibyls thrust forth their grey
heads, imperfectly covered with close caps of flannel, and showed their
shrivelled brows, and long skinny arms, with various gestures, shrugs,
and muttered expressions in Gaelic addressed to each other, my
imagination recurred to the witches of Macbeth, and I imagined I read in
the features of these crones the malevolence of the weird sisters. The
little children also, who began to crawl forth, some quite naked, and
others very imperfectly covered with tatters of tartan stuff, clapped
their tiny hands, and grinned at the English soldiers, with an expression
of national hate and malignity which seemed beyond their years. I
remarked particularly that there were no men, nor so much as a boy of ten
or twelve years old, to be seen among the inhabitants of a village which
seemed populous in proportion to its extent; and the idea certainly
occurred to me, that we were likely to receive from them, in the course
of our journey, more effectual tokens of ill-will than those which
lowered on the visages, and dictated the murmurs, of the women and
children. It was not until we commenced our march that the malignity of
the elder persons of the community broke forth into expressions. The last
file of men had left the village, to pursue a small broken track, formed
by the sledges in which the natives transported their peats and turfs,
and which led through the woods that fringed the lower end of the lake,
when a shrilly sound of female exclamation broke forth, mixed with the
screams of children, the whooping of boys, and the clapping of hands,
with which the Highland dames enforce their notes, whether of rage or
lamentation. I asked Andrew, who looked as pale as death, what all this
meant.

â€œI doubt weâ€™ll ken that ower sune,â€ said he. â€œMeans? It means that the
Highland wives are cursing and banning the red-coats, and wishing
ill-luck to them, and ilka ane that ever spoke the Saxon tongue. I have
heard wives flyte in England and Scotland--itâ€™s nae marvel to hear them
flyte ony gate; but sic ill-scrapit tongues as thae Highland
carlinesâ€™--and sic grewsome wishes, that men should be slaughtered like
sheep--and that they may lapper their hands to the elbows in their
heartâ€™s blude--and that they suld dee the death of Walter Cuming of
Guiyock, wha hadna as muckle oâ€™ him left thegither as would supper a
messan-dog--sic awsome language as that I neâ€™er heard out oâ€™ a human
thrapple;--and, unless the deil wad rise amang them to gie them a
lesson, I thinkna that their talent at cursing could be amended.

The warst oâ€™t is, they bid us aye gang up the loch, and see what weâ€™ll
land in.â€

Adding Andrewâ€™s information to what I had myself observed, I could scarce
doubt that some attack was meditated upon our party. The road, as we
advanced, seemed to afford every facility for such an unpleasant
interruption. At first it winded apart from the lake through marshy
meadow ground, overgrown with copsewood, now traversing dark and close
thickets which would have admitted an ambuscade to be sheltered within a
few yards of our line of march, and frequently crossing rough mountain
torrents, some of which took the soldiers up to the knees, and ran with
such violence, that their force could only be stemmed by the strength of
two or three men holding fast by each otherâ€™s arms. It certainly appeared
to me, though altogether unacquainted with military affairs, that a sort
of half-savage warriors, as I had heard the Highlanders asserted to be,
might, in such passes as these, attack a party of regular forces with
great advantage. The Bailieâ€™s good sense and shrewd observation had led
him to the same conclusion, as I understood from his requesting to speak
with the captain, whom he addressed nearly in the following terms:--
â€œCaptain, itâ€™s no to fleech ony favour out oâ€™ ye, for I scorn it--and
itâ€™s under protest that I reserve my action and pleas of oppression and
wrongous imprisonment;--but, being a friend to King George and his army,
I take the liberty to speer--Dinna ye think ye might tak a better time to
gang up this glen? If ye are seeking Rob Roy, heâ€™s kenâ€™d to be better
than half a hunder men strong when heâ€™s at the fewest; an if he brings in
the Glengyle folk, and the Glenfinlas and Balquhidder lads, he may come
to gie you your kail through the reek; and itâ€™s my sincere advice, as a
kingâ€™s friend, ye had better tak back again to the Clachan, for thae
women at Aberfoil are like the scarts and seamaws at the Cumries--thereâ€™s
aye foul weather follows their skirting.â€

â€œMake yourself easy, sir,â€ replied Captain Thornton; â€œI am in the
execution of my orders. And as you say you are a friend to King George,
you will be glad to learn that it is impossible that this gang of
ruffians, whose license has disturbed the country so long, can escape the
measures now taken to suppress them. The horse squadron of militia,
commanded by Major Galbraith, is already joined by two or more troops of
cavalry, which will occupy all the lower passes of this wild country;
three hundred Highlanders, under the two gentlemen you saw at the inn,
are in possession of the upper part, and various strong parties from the
garrison are securing the hills and glens in different directions. Our
last accounts of Rob Roy correspond with what this fellow has confessed,
that, finding himself surrounded on all sides, he had dismissed the
greater part of his followers, with the purpose either of lying
concealed, or of making his escape through his superior knowledge of the
passes.â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ said the Bailie; â€œthereâ€™s mair brandy than brains in
Garschattachinâ€™s head this morning--And I wadna, an I were you, Captain,
rest my main dependence on the Hielandmen--hawks winna pike out hawksâ€™
een. They may quarrel among themsells, and gie ilk ither ill names, and
maybe a slash wiâ€™ a claymore; but they are sure to join in the lang run,
against aâ€™ civilised folk, that wear breeks on their hinder ends, and hae
purses in their pouches.â€

Apparently these admonitions were not altogether thrown away on Captain
Thornton. He reformed his line of march, commanded his soldiers to
unsling their firelocks and fix their bayonets, and formed an advanced
and rear-guard, each consisting of a non-commissioned officer and two
soldiers, who received strict orders to keep an alert look-out. Dougal
underwent another and very close examination, in which he steadfastly
asserted the truth of what he had before affirmed; and being rebuked on
account of the suspicious and dangerous appearance of the route by which
he was guiding them, he answered with a sort of testiness that seemed
very natural, â€œHer nainsell didna mak ta road; an shentlemans likit grand
roads, she suld hae pided at Glasco.â€

All this passed off well enough, and we resumed our progress.

Our route, though leading towards the lake, had hitherto been so much
shaded by wood, that we only from time to time obtained a glimpse of that
beautiful sheet of water. But the road now suddenly emerged from the
forest ground, and, winding close by the margin of the loch, afforded us
a full view of its spacious mirror, which now, the breeze having totally
subsided, reflected in still magnificence the high dark heathy mountains,
huge grey rocks, and shaggy banks, by which it is encircled. The hills
now sunk on its margin so closely, and were so broken and precipitous, as
to afford no passage except just upon the narrow line of the track which
we occupied, and which was overhung with rocks, from which we might have
been destroyed merely by rolling down stones, without much possibility of
offering resistance. Add to this, that, as the road winded round every
promontory and bay which indented the lake, there was rarely a
possibility of seeing a hundred yards before us. Our commander appeared
to take some alarm at the nature of the pass in which he was engaged,
which displayed itself in repeated orders to his soldiers to be on the
alert, and in many threats of instant death to Dougal, if he should be
found to have led them into danger. Dougal received these threats with an
air of stupid impenetrability, which might arise either from conscious
innocence, or from dogged resolution.

â€œIf shentlemans were seeking ta Red Gregarach,â€ he said, â€œto be sure they
couldna expect to find her without some wee danger.â€

Just as the Highlander uttered these words, a halt was made by the
corporal commanding the advance, who sent back one of the file who formed
it, to tell the Captain that the path in front was occupied by
Highlanders, stationed on a commanding point of particular difficulty.
Almost at the same instant a soldier from the rear came to say, that they
heard the sound of a bagpipe in the woods through which we had just
passed. Captain Thornton, a man of conduct as well as courage, instantly
resolved to force the pass in front, without waiting till he was assailed
from the rear; and, assuring his soldiers that the bagpipes which they
heard were those of the friendly Highlanders who were advancing to their
assistance, he stated to them the importance of advancing and securing
Rob Roy, if possible, before these auxiliaries should come up to divide
with them the honour, as well as the reward which was placed on the head
of this celebrated freebooter. He therefore ordered the rearguard to join
the centre, and both to close up to the advance, doubling his files so as
to occupy with his column the whole practicable part of the road, and to
present such a front as its breadth admitted. Dougal, to whom he said in
a whisper, â€œYou dog, if you have deceived me, you shall die for it!â€ was
placed in the centre, between two grenadiers, with positive orders to
shoot him if he attempted an escape. The same situation was assigned to
us, as being the safest, and Captain Thornton, taking his half-pike from
the soldier who carried it, placed himself at the head of his little
detachment, and gave the word to march forward.

The party advanced with the firmness of English soldiers. Not so Andrew
Fairservice, who was frightened out of his wits; and not so, if truth
must be told, either the Bailie or I myself, who, without feeling the
same degree of trepidation, could not with stoical indifference see our
lives exposed to hazard in a quarrel with which we had no concern. But
there was neither time for remonstrance nor remedy.

We approached within about twenty yards of the spot where the advanced
guard had seen some appearance of an enemy. It was one of those
promontories which run into the lake, and round the base of which the
road had hitherto winded in the manner I have described. In the present
case, however, the path, instead of keeping the waterâ€™s edge, sealed the
promontory by one or two rapid zigzags, carried in a broken track along
the precipitous face of a slaty grey rock, which would otherwise have
been absolutely inaccessible. On the top of this rock, only to be
approached by a road so broken, so narrow, and so precarious, the
corporal declared he had seen the bonnets and long-barrelled guns of
several mountaineers, apparently couched among the long heath and
brushwood which crested the eminence. Captain Thornton ordered him to
move forward with three files, to dislodge the supposed ambuscade, while,
at a more slow but steady pace, he advanced to his support with the rest
of his party.

The attack which he meditated was prevented by the unexpected apparition
of a female upon the summit of the rock.

â€œStand!â€ she said, with a commanding tone, â€œand tell me what ye seek in
MacGregorâ€™s country?â€

I have seldom seen a finer or more commanding form than this woman. She
might be between the term of forty and fifty years, and had a countenance
which must once have been of a masculine cast of beauty; though now,
imprinted with deep lines by exposure to rough weather, and perhaps by
the wasting influence of grief and passion, its features were only
strong, harsh, and expressive. She wore her plaid, not drawn around her
head and shoulders, as is the fashion of the women in Scotland, but
disposed around her body as the Highland soldiers wear theirs. She had a
manâ€™s bonnet, with a feather in it, an unsheathed sword in her hand, and
a pair of pistols at her girdle.

â€œItâ€™s Helen Campbell, Robâ€™s wife,â€ said the Bailie, in a whisper of
considerable alarm; â€œand there will be broken heads amang us or itâ€™s
lang.â€

â€œWhat seek ye here?â€ she asked again of Captain Thornton, who had himself
advanced to reconnoitre.

â€œWe seek the outlaw, Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell,â€ answered the officer,
â€œand make no war on women; therefore offer no vain opposition to the
kingâ€™s troops, and assure yourself of civil treatment.â€

â€œAy,â€ retorted the Amazon, â€œI am no stranger to your tender mercies. Ye
have left me neither name nor fame--my motherâ€™s bones will shrink aside
in their grave when mine are laid beside them--Ye have left me neither
house nor hold, blanket nor bedding, cattle to feed us, or flocks to
clothe us--Ye have taken from us all--all!--The very name of our
ancestors have ye taken away, and now ye come for our lives.â€

â€œI seek no manâ€™s life,â€ replied the Captain; â€œI only execute my orders.
If you are alone, good woman, you have nought to fear--if there are any
with you so rash as to offer useless resistance, their own blood be on
their own heads. Move forward, sergeant.â€

â€œForward! march!â€ said the non-commissioned officer. â€œHuzza, my boys, for
Rob Royâ€™s head and a purse of gold.â€

He quickened his pace into a run, followed by the six soldiers; but as
they attained the first traverse of the ascent, the flash of a dozen of
firelocks from various parts of the pass parted in quick succession and
deliberate aim. The sergeant, shot through the body, still struggled to
gain the ascent, raised himself by his hands to clamber up the face of
the rock, but relaxed his grasp, after a desperate effort, and falling,
rolled from the face of the cliff into the deep lake, where he perished.
Of the soldiers, three fell, slain or disabled; the others retreated on
their main body, all more or less wounded.

â€œGrenadiers, to the front!â€ said Captain Thornton.--You are to recollect,
that in those days this description of soldiers actually carried that
destructive species of firework from which they derive their name. The
four grenadiers moved to the front accordingly. The officer commanded the
rest of the party to be ready to support them, and only saying to us,
â€œLook to your safety, gentlemen,â€ gave, in rapid succession, the word to
the grenadiers--â€œOpen your pouches--handle your grenades--blow your
matches--fall on.â€

The whole advanced with a shout, headed by Captain Thornton,--the
grenadiers preparing to throw their grenades among the bushes where the
ambuscade lay, and the musketeers to support them by an instant and close
assault. Dougal, forgotten in the scuffle, wisely crept into the thicket
which overhung that part of the road where we had first halted, which he
ascended with the activity of a wild cat. I followed his example,
instinctively recollecting that the fire of the Highlanders would sweep
the open track. I clambered until out of breath; for a continued
spattering fire, in which every shot was multiplied by a thousand echoes,
the hissing of the kindled fusees of the grenades, and the successive
explosion of those missiles, mingled with the huzzas of the soldiers, and
the yells and cries of their Highland antagonists, formed a contrast
which added--I do not shame to own it--wings to my desire to reach a
place of safety. The difficulties of the ascent soon increased so much,
that I despaired of reaching Dougal, who seemed to swing himself from
rock to rock, and stump to stump, with the facility of a squirrel, and I
turned down my eyes to see what had become of my other companions. Both
were brought to a very awkward standstill.

The Bailie, to whom I suppose fear had given a temporary share of
agility, had ascended about twenty feet from the path, when his foot
slipping, as he straddled from one huge fragment of rock to another, he
would have slumbered with his father the deacon, whose acts and words he
was so fond of quoting, but for a projecting branch of a ragged thorn,
which, catching hold of the skirts of his riding-coat, supported him in
mid-air, where he dangled not unlike to the sign of the Golden Fleece
over the door of a mercer in the Trongate of his native city.

As for Andrew Fairservice, he had advanced with better success, until he
had attained the top of a bare cliff, which, rising above the wood,
exposed him, at least in his own opinion, to all the dangers of the
neighbouring skirmish, while, at the same time, it was of such a
precipitous and impracticable nature, that he dared neither to advance
nor retreat. Footing it up and down upon the narrow space which the top
of the cliff afforded (very like a fellow at a country-fair dancing upon
a trencher), he roared for mercy in Gaelic and English alternately,
according to the side on which the scale of victory seemed to
predominate, while his exclamations were only answered by the groans of
the Bailie, who suffered much, not only from apprehension, but from the
pendulous posture in which he hung suspended by the loins.

On perceiving the Bailieâ€™s precarious situation, my first idea was to
attempt to render him assistance; but this was impossible without the
concurrence of Andrew, whom neither sign, nor entreaty, nor command, nor
expostulation, could inspire with courage to adventure the descent from
his painful elevation, where, like an unskilful and obnoxious minister of
state, unable to escape from the eminence to which he had presumptuously
ascended, he continued to pour forth piteous prayers for mercy, which no
one heard, and to skip to and fro, writhing his body into all possible
antic shapes to avoid the balls which he conceived to be whistling around
him.

In a few minutes this cause of terror ceased, for the fire, at first so
well sustained, now sunk at once--a sure sign that the conflict was
concluded. To gain some spot from which I could see how the day had gone
was now my object, in order to appeal to the mercy of the victors, who, I
trusted (whichever side might be gainers), would not suffer the honest
Bailie to remain suspended, like the coffin of Mahomet, between heaven
and earth, without lending a hand to disengage him. At length, by dint of
scrambling, I found a spot which commanded a view of the field of battle.
It was indeed ended; and, as my mind already augured, from the place and
circumstances attending the contest, it had terminated in the defeat of
Captain Thornton. I saw a party of Highlanders in the act of disarming
that officer, and the scanty remainder of his party. They consisted of
about twelve men most of whom were wounded, who, surrounded by treble
their number, and without the power either to advance or retreat, exposed
to a murderous and well-aimed fire, which they had no means of returning
with effect, had at length laid down their arms by the order of their
officer, when he saw that the road in his rear was occupied, and that
protracted resistance would be only wasting the lives of his brave
followers. By the Highlanders, who fought under cover, the victory was
cheaply bought, at the expense of one man slain and two wounded by the
grenades. All this I learned afterwards. At present I only comprehended
the general result of the day, from seeing the English officer, whose
face was covered with blood, stripped of his hat and arms, and his men,
with sullen and dejected countenances which marked their deep regret,
enduring, from the wild and martial figures who surrounded them, the
severe measures to which the laws of war subject the vanquished for
security of the victors.





CHAPTER FOURTEEN.

            â€œWoe to the vanquished!â€ was stern Brennoâ€™s word,
             When sunk proud Rome beneath the Gallic sword--
            â€œWoe to the vanquished!â€ when his massive blade
             Bore down the scale against her ransom weighâ€™d;
                And on the field of foughten battle still,
                Woe knows no limits save the victorâ€™s will.
                                                  The Gaulliad.

I anxiously endeavoured to distinguish Dougal among the victors. I had
little doubt that the part he had played was assumed, on purpose to lead
the English officer into the defile, and I could not help admiring the
address with which the ignorant, and apparently half-brutal savage, had
veiled his purpose, and the affected reluctance with which he had
suffered to be extracted from him the false information which it must
have been his purpose from the beginning to communicate. I foresaw we
should incur some danger on approaching the victors in the first flush of
their success, which was not unstained with cruelty; for one or two of
the soldiers, whose wounds prevented them from rising, were poniarded by
the victors, or rather by some ragged Highland boys who had mingled with
them. I concluded, therefore, it would be unsafe to present ourselves
without some mediator; and as Campbell, whom I now could not but identify
with the celebrated freebooter Rob Roy, was nowhere to be seen, I
resolved to claim the protection of his emissary, Dougal.

After gazing everywhere in vain, I at length retraced my steps to see
what assistance I could individually render to my unlucky friend, when,
to my great joy, I saw Mr. Jarvie delivered from his state of suspense;
and though very black in the face, and much deranged in the garments,
safely seated beneath the rock, in front of which he had been so lately
suspended. I hastened to join him and offer my congratulations, which he
was at first far from receiving in the spirit of cordiality with which
they were offered. A heavy fit of coughing scarce permitted him breath
enough to express the broken hints which he threw out against my
sincerity.

â€œUh! uh! uh! uh!--they say a friend--uh! uh!--a friend sticketh closer
than a brither--uh! uh! uh! When I came up here, Maister Osbaldistone, to
this country, cursed of God and man--uh! uh--Heaven forgie me for
swearing--on nae manâ€™s errand but yours, dâ€™ye think it was fair--uh! uh!
uh!--to leave me, first, to be shot or drowned atween red-wad Highlanders
and red-coats; and next to be hung up between heaven and earth, like an
auld potato-bogle, without sae muckle as trying--uh! uh!--sae muckle as
trying to relieve me?â€

I made a thousand apologies, and laboured so hard to represent the
impossibility of my affording him relief by my own unassisted exertions,
that at length I succeeded, and the Bailie, who was as placable as hasty
in his temper, extended his favour to me once more. I next took the
liberty of asking him how he had contrived to extricate himself.

â€œMe extricate! I might hae hung there till the day of judgment or I could
hae helped mysell, wiâ€™ my head hinging down on the tae side, and my heels
on the tother, like the yarn-scales in the weigh-house. It was the
creature Dougal that extricated me, as he did yestreen; he cuttit aff the
tails oâ€™ my coat wiâ€™ his durk, and another gillie and him set me on my
legs as cleverly as if I had never been aff them. But to see what a thing
gude braid claith is! Had I been in ony oâ€™ your rotten French camlets
now, or your drab-de-berries, it would hae screeded like an auld rag wiâ€™
sic a weight as mine. But fair faâ€™ the weaver that wrought the weft
oâ€™t--I swung and bobbit yonder as safe as a gabbart thatâ€™s moored by a
three-ply cable at the Broomielaw.â€

I now inquired what had become of his preserver.

â€œThe creature,â€ so he continued to call the Highlandman, â€œcontrived to
let me ken there wad be danger in gaun near the leddy till he came back,
and bade me stay here. I am oâ€™ the mind,â€ he continued, â€œthat heâ€™s
seeking after you--itâ€™s a considerate creature--and troth, I wad swear he
was right about the leddy, as he caâ€™s her, too--Helen Campbell was nane
oâ€™ the maist douce maidens, nor meekest wives neither, and folk say that
Rob himsell stands in awe oâ€™ her. I doubt she winna ken me, for itâ€™s mony
years since we met--I am clear for waiting for the Dougal creature or we
gang near her.â€

I signified my acquiescence in this reasoning; but it was not the will of
fate that day that the Bailieâ€™s prudence should profit himself or any one
else.

Andrew Fairservice, though he had ceased to caper on the pinnacle upon
the cessation of the firing, which had given occasion for his whimsical
exercise, continued, as perched on the top of an exposed cliff, too
conspicuous an object to escape the sharp eyes of the Highlanders, when
they had time to look a little around them. We were apprized he was
discovered, by a wild and loud halloo set up among the assembled victors,
three or four of whom instantly plunged into the copsewood, and ascended
the rocky side of the hill in different directions towards the place
where they had discovered this whimsical apparition.

Those who arrived first within gunshot of poor Andrew, did not trouble
themselves to offer him any assistance in the ticklish posture of his
affairs, but levelling their long Spanish-barrelled guns, gave him to
understand, by signs which admitted of no misconstruction, that he must
contrive to come down and submit himself to their mercy, or to be marked
at from beneath, like a regimental target set up for ball-practice. With
such a formidable hint for venturous exertion, Andrew Fairservice could
no longer hesitate; the more imminent peril overcame his sense of that
which seemed less inevitable, and he began to descend the cliff at all
risks, clutching to the ivy and oak stumps, and projecting fragments of
rock, with an almost feverish anxiety, and never failing, as
circumstances left him a hand at liberty, to extend it to the plaided
gentry below in an attitude of supplication, as if to deprecate the
discharge of their levelled firearms. In a word, the fellow, under the
influence of a counteracting motive for terror, achieved a safe descent
from his perilous eminence, which, I verily believe, nothing but the fear
of instant death could have moved him to attempt. The awkward mode of
Andrewâ€™s descent greatly amused the Highlanders below, who fired a shot
or two while he was engaged in it, without the purpose of injuring him,
as I believe, but merely to enhance the amusement they derived from his
extreme terror, and the superlative exertions of agility to which it
excited him.

At length he attained firm and comparatively level ground--or rather, to
speak more correctly, his foot slipping at the last point of descent, he
fell on the earth at his full length, and was raised by the assistance of
the Highlanders, who stood to receive him, and who, ere he gained his
legs, stripped him not only of the whole contents of his pockets, but of
periwig, hat, coat, doublet, stockings, and shoes, performing the feat
with such admirable celerity, that, although he fell on his back a
well-clothed and decent burgher-seeming serving-man, he arose a forked,
uncased, bald-pated, beggarly-looking scarecrow. Without respect to the
pain which his undefended toes experienced from the sharp encounter of
the rocks over which they hurried him, those who had detected Andrew
proceeded to drag him downward towards the road through all the
intervening obstacles.

In the course of their descent, Mr. Jarvie and I became exposed to their
lynx-eyed observation, and instantly half-a-dozen of armed Highlanders
thronged around us, with drawn dirks and swords pointed at our faces and
throats, and cocked pistols presented against our bodies. To have offered
resistance would have been madness, especially as we had no weapons
capable of supporting such a demonstration. We therefore submitted to our
fate; and with great roughness on the part of those who assisted at our
toilette, were in the act of being reduced to as unsophisticated a state
(to use King Learâ€™s phrase) as the plume-less biped Andrew Fairservice,
who stood shivering between fear and cold at a few yardsâ€™ distance. Good
chance, however, saved us from this extremity of wretchedness; for, just
as I had yielded up my cravat (a smart Steinkirk, by the way, and richly
laced), and the Bailie had been disrobed of the fragments of his
riding-coat--enter Dougal, and the scene was changed. By a high tone of
expostulation, mixed with oaths and threats, as far as I could conjecture
the tenor of his language from the violence of his gestures, he compelled
the plunderers, however reluctant, not only to give up their further
depredations on our property, but to restore the spoil they had already
appropriated. He snatched my cravat from the fellow who had seized it,
and twisted it (in the zeal of his restitution) around my neck with such
suffocating energy as made me think that he had not only been, during his
residence at Glasgow, a substitute of the jailor, but must moreover have
taken lessons as an apprentice of the hangman. He flung the tattered
remnants of Mr. Jarvieâ€™s coat around his shoulders, and as more
Highlanders began to flock towards us from the high road, he led the way
downwards, directing and commanding the others to afford us, but
particularly the Bailie, the assistance necessary to our descending with
comparative ease and safety. It was, however, in vain that Andrew
Fairservice employed his lungs in obsecrating a share of Dougalâ€™s
protection, or at least his interference to procure restoration of his
shoes.

â€œNa, na,â€ said Dougal in reply, â€œsheâ€™s nae gentle pody, I trow; her
petters hae ganged parefoot, or sheâ€™s muckle mistaâ€™en.â€ And, leaving
Andrew to follow at his leisure, or rather at such leisure as the
surrounding crowd were pleased to indulge him with, he hurried us down to
the pathway in which the skirmish had been fought, and hastened to
present us as additional captives to the female leader of his band.

We were dragged before her accordingly, Dougal fighting, struggling,
screaming, as if he were the party most apprehensive of hurt, and
repulsing, by threats and efforts, all those who attempted to take a
nearer interest in our capture than he seemed to do himself. At length we
were placed before the heroine of the day, whose appearance, as well as
those of the savage, uncouth, yet martial figures who surrounded us,
struck me, to own the truth, with considerable apprehension. I do not
know if Helen MacGregor had personally mingled in the fray, and indeed I
was afterwards given to understand the contrary; but the specks of blood
on her brow, her hands and naked arms, as well as on the blade of her
sword which she continued to hold in her hand--her flushed countenance,
and the disordered state of the raven locks which escaped from under the
red bonnet and plume that formed her head-dress, seemed all to intimate
that she had taken an immediate share in the conflict. Her keen black
eyes and features expressed an imagination inflamed by the pride of
gratified revenge, and the triumph of victory. Yet there was nothing
positively sanguinary, or cruel, in her deportment; and she reminded me,
when the immediate alarm of the interview was over, of some of the
paintings I had seen of the inspired heroines in the Catholic churches of
France. She was not, indeed, sufficiently beautiful for a Judith, nor had
she the inspired expression of features which painters have given to
Deborah, or to the wife of Heber the Kenite, at whose feet the strong
oppressor of Israel, who dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles, bowed
down, fell, and lay a dead man. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm by which she
was agitated gave her countenance and deportment, wildly dignified in
themselves, an air which made her approach nearly to the ideas of those
wonderful artists who gave to the eye the heroines of Scripture history.

I was uncertain in what terms to accost a personage so uncommon, when Mr.
Jarvie, breaking the ice with a preparatory cough (for the speed with
which he had been brought into her presence had again impeded his
respiration), addressed her as follows:--â€œUh! uh! &c. &c. I am very happy
to have this _joyful_ opportunityâ€ (a quaver in his voice strongly belied
the emphasis which he studiously laid on the word joyful)--â€œthis joyful
occasion,â€ he resumed, trying to give the adjective a more suitable
accentuation, â€œto wish my kinsman Robinâ€™s wife a very good morning--Uh!
uh!--Howâ€™s aâ€™ wiâ€™ ye?â€ (by this time he had talked himself into his usual
jog-trot manner, which exhibited a mixture of familiarity and
self-importance)--â€œHowâ€™s aâ€™ wiâ€™ ye this lang time? Yeâ€™ll hae forgotten
me, Mrs. MacGregor Campbell, as your cousin--uh! uh!--but yeâ€™ll mind my
father, Deacon Nicol Jarvie, in the Saut Market oâ€™ Glasgow?--an honest
man he was, and a sponsible, and respectit you and yours. Sae, as I said
before, I am right glad to see you, Mrs. MacGregor Campbell, as my
kinsmanâ€™s wife. I wad crave the liberty of a kinsman to salute you, but
that your gillies keep such a dolefuâ€™ fast haud oâ€™ my arms, and, to speak
Heavenâ€™s truth and a magistrateâ€™s, ye wadna be the waur of a cogfuâ€™ oâ€™
water before ye welcomed your friends.â€

There was something in the familiarity of this introduction which ill
suited the exalted state of temper of the person to whom it was
addressed, then busied with distributing dooms of death, and warm from
conquest in a perilous encounter.

â€œWhat fellow are you,â€ she said, â€œthat dare to claim kindred with the
MacGregor, and neither wear his dress nor speak his language?--What are
you, that have the tongue and the habit of the hound, and yet seek to lie
down with the deer?â€

â€œI dinna ken,â€ said the undaunted Bailie, â€œif the kindred has ever been
weel redd out to you yet, cousin--but itâ€™s kenâ€™d, and can be provâ€™d. My
mother, Elspeth MacFarlane, was the wife of my father, Deacon Nicol
Jarvie--peace be wiâ€™ them baith!--and Elspeth was the daughter of Parlane
MacFarlane, at the Sheeling oâ€™ Loch Sloy. Now, this Parlane MacFarlane,
as his surviving daughter Maggy MacFarlane, _alias_ MacNab, wha married
Duncan MacNab oâ€™ Stuckavrallachan, can testify, stood as near to your
gudeman, Robert MacGregor, as in the fourth degree of kindred, forâ€--

The virago lopped the genealogical tree, by demanding haughtily, â€œIf a
stream of rushing water acknowledged any relation with the portion
withdrawn from it for the mean domestic uses of those who dwelt on its
banks?â€

â€œVera true, kinswoman,â€ said the Bailie; â€œbut for aâ€™ that, the burn wad
be glad to hae the milldam back again in simmer, when the chuckie-stanes
are white in the sun. I ken weel eneugh you Hieland folk haud us Glasgow
people light and cheap for our language and our claes;--but everybody
speaks their native tongue that they learned in infancy; and it would be
a daft-like thing to see me wiâ€™ my fat wame in a short Hieland coat, and
my puir short houghs gartered below the knee, like ane oâ€™ your
lang-legged gillies. Mair by token, kinswoman,â€ he continued, in defiance
of various intimations by which Dougal seemed to recommend silence, as
well as of the marks of impatience which the Amazon evinced at his
loquacity, â€œI wad hae ye to mind that the kingâ€™s errand whiles comes in
the cadgerâ€™s gate, and that, for as high as ye may think oâ€™ the gudeman,
as itâ€™s right every wife should honour her husband--thereâ€™s Scripture
warrant for that--yet as high as ye haud him, as I was saying, I hae been
serviceable to Rob ere now;--forbye a set oâ€™ pearlins I sent yourself
when ye was gaun to be married, and when Rob was an honest weel-doing
drover, and nane oâ€™ this unlawfuâ€™ wark, wiâ€™ fighting, and flashes, and
fluff-gibs, disturbing the kingâ€™s peace and disarming his soldiers.â€

He had apparently touched on a key which his kinswoman could not brook.
She drew herself up to her full height, and betrayed the acuteness of her
feelings by a laugh of mingled scorn and bitterness.

â€œYes,â€ she said, â€œyou, and such as you, might claim a relation to us,
when we stooped to be the paltry wretches fit to exist under your
dominion, as your hewers of wood and drawers of water--to find cattle for
your banquets, and subjects for your laws to oppress and trample on. But
now we are free--free by the very act which left us neither house nor
hearth, food nor covering--which bereaved me of all--of all--and makes me
groan when I think I must still cumber the earth for other purposes than
those of vengeance. And I will carry on the work, this day has so well
commenced, by a deed that shall break all bands between MacGregor and the
Lowland churls. Here Allan--Dougal--bind these Sassenachs neck and heel
together, and throw them into the Highland Loch to seek for their
Highland kinsfolk.â€

The Bailie, alarmed at this mandate, was commencing an expostulation,
which probably would have only inflamed the violent passions of the
person whom he addressed, when Dougal threw himself between them, and in
his own language, which he spoke with a fluency and rapidity strongly
contrasted by the slow, imperfect, and idiot-like manner in which he
expressed himself in English, poured forth what I doubt not was a very
animated pleading in our behalf.

His mistress replied to him, or rather cut short his harangue, by
exclaiming in English (as if determined to make us taste in anticipation
the full bitterness of death)--â€œBase dog, and son of a dog, do you
dispute my commands? Should I tell ye to cut out their tongues and put
them into each otherâ€™s throats, to try which would there best knap
Southron, or to tear out their hearts and put them into each otherâ€™s
breasts, to see which would there best plot treason against the
MacGregor--and such things have been done of old in the day of revenge,
when our fathers had wrongs to redress--Should I command you to do this,
would it be your part to dispute my orders?â€

â€œTo be sure, to be sure,â€ Dougal replied, with accents of profound
submission; â€œher pleasure suld be done--tatâ€™s but reason; but an it
were--tat is, an it could be thought the same to her to coup the
ill-faured loon of ta red-coat Captain, and hims corporal Cramp, and twa
three oâ€™ the red-coats, into the loch, herself wad doâ€™t wiâ€™ muckle mair
great satisfaction than to hurt ta honest civil shentlemans as were
friends to the Gregarach, and came up on the Chiefs assurance, and not
to do no treason, as herself could testify.â€

The lady was about to reply, when a few wild strains of a pibroch were
heard advancing up the road from Aberfoil, the same probably which had
reached the ears of Captain Thorntonâ€™s rear-guard, and determined him to
force his way onward rather than return to the village, on finding the
pass occupied. The skirmish being of very short duration, the armed men
who followed this martial melody, had not, although quickening their
march when they heard the firing, been able to arrive in time sufficient
to take any share in the rencontre. The victory, therefore, was complete
without them, and they now arrived only to share in the triumph of their
countrymen.

There was a marked difference betwixt the appearance of these new comers
and that of the party by which our escort had been defeated--and it was
greatly in favour of the former. Among the Highlanders who surrounded the
Chieftainess, if I may presume to call her so without offence to grammar,
were men in the extremity of age, boys scarce able to bear a sword, and
even women--all, in short, whom the last necessity urges to take up arms;
and it added a shade of bitter shame to the defection which clouded
Thorntonâ€™s manly countenance, when he found that the numbers and position
of a foe, otherwise so despicable, had enabled them to conquer his brave
veterans. But the thirty or forty Highlanders who now joined the others,
were all men in the prime of youth or manhood, active clean-made fellows,
whose short hose and belted plaids set out their sinewy limbs to the best
advantage. Their arms were as superior to those of the first party as
their dress and appearance. The followers of the female Chief had axes,
scythes, and other antique weapons, in aid of their guns; and some had
only clubs, daggers, and long knives. But of the second party, most had
pistols at the belt, and almost all had dirks hanging at the pouches
which they wore in front. Each had a good gun in his hand, and a
broadsword by his side, besides a stout round target, made of light wood,
covered with leather, and curiously studded with brass, and having a
steel spike screwed into the centre. These hung on their left shoulder
during a march, or while they were engaged in exchanging fire with the
enemy, and were worn on their left arm when they charged with sword in
hand.

But it was easy to see that this chosen band had not arrived from a
victory such as they found their ill-appointed companions possessed of.
The pibroch sent forth occasionally a few wailing notes expressive of a
very different sentiment from triumph; and when they appeared before the
wife of their Chieftain, it was in silence, and with downcast and
melancholy looks. They paused when they approached her, and the pipes
again sent forth the same wild and melancholy strain.

Helen rushed towards them with a countenance in which anger was mingled
with apprehension.--â€œWhat means this, Alaster?â€ she said to the
minstrel--â€œwhy a lament in the moment of victory?--Robert--Hamish--whereâ€™s
the MacGregor?--whereâ€™s your father?â€

Her sons, who led the band, advanced with slow and irresolute steps
towards her, and murmured a few words in Gaelic, at hearing which she set
up a shriek that made the rocks ring again, in which all the women and
boys joined, clapping their hands and yelling as if their lives had been
expiring in the sound. The mountain echoes, silent since the military
sounds of battle had ceased, had now to answer these frantic and
discordant shrieks of sorrow, which drove the very night-birds from their
haunts in the rocks, as if they were startled to hear orgies more hideous
and ill-omened than their own, performed in the face of open day.

â€œTaken!â€ repeated Helen, when the clamour had subsided--â€œTaken!--
captive!--and you live to say so?--Coward dogs! did I nurse you for this,
that you should spare your blood on your fatherâ€™s enemies? or see him
prisoner, and come back to tell it?â€

The sons of MacGregor, to whom this expostulation was addressed, were
youths, of whom the eldest had hardly attained his twentieth year.
_Hamish,_ or James, the elder of these youths, was the tallest by a head,
and much handsomer than his brother; his light-blue eyes, with a
profusion of fair hair, which streamed from under his smart blue bonnet,
made his whole appearance a most favourable specimen of the Highland
youth. The younger was called Robert; but, to distinguish him from his
father, the Highlanders added the epithet _Oig,_ or the young. Dark hair,
and dark features, with a ruddy glow of health and animation, and a form
strong and well-set beyond his years, completed the sketch of the young
mountaineer.

Both now stood before their mother with countenances clouded with grief
and shame, and listened, with the most respectful submission, to the
reproaches with which she loaded them. At length when her resentment
appeared in some degree to subside, the eldest, speaking in English,
probably that he might not be understood by their followers, endeavoured
respectfully to vindicate himself and his brother from his motherâ€™s
reproaches. I was so near him as to comprehend much of what he said; and,
as it was of great consequence to me to be possessed of information in
this strange crisis, I failed not to listen as attentively as I could.

â€œThe MacGregor,â€ his son stated, â€œhad been called out upon a trysting
with a Lowland hallion, who came with a token fromâ€--he muttered the name
very low, but I thought it sounded like my own. â€œThe MacGregor,â€ he said,
â€œaccepted of the invitation, but commanded the Saxon who brought the
message to be detained, as a hostage that good faith should be observed
to him. Accordingly he went to the place of appointmentâ€ (which had some
wild Highland name that I cannot remember), â€œattended only by Angus Breck
and Little Rory, commanding no one to follow him. Within half an hour
Angus Breck came back with the doleful tidings that the MacGregor had
been surprised and made prisoner by a party of Lennox militia, under
Galbraith of Garschattachin.â€ He added, â€œthat Galbraith, on being
threatened by MacGregor, who upon his capture menaced him with
retaliation on the person of the hostage, had treated the threat with
great contempt, replying, â€˜Let each side hang his man; weâ€™ll hang the
thief, and your catherans may hang the gauger, Rob, and the country will
be rid of two damned things at once, a wild Highlander and a revenue
officer.â€™ Angus Breck, less carefully looked to than his master,
contrived to escape from the hands of the captors, after having been in
their custody long enough to hear this discussion, and to bring off the
news.â€

â€œAnd did you learn this, you false-hearted traitor,â€ said the wife of
MacGregor, â€œand not instantly rush to your fatherâ€™s rescue, to bring him
off, or leave your body on the place?â€

The young MacGregor modestly replied, by representing the very superior
force of the enemy, and stated, that as they made no preparation for
leaving the country, he had fallen back up the glen with the purpose of
collecting a band sufficient to attempt a rescue with some tolerable
chance of success. At length he said, â€œthe militiamen would quarter, he
understood, in the neighbouring house of Gartartan, or the old castle in
the port of Monteith, or some other stronghold, which, although strong
and defensible, was nevertheless capable of being surprised, could they
but get enough of men assembled for the purpose.â€

I understood afterwards that the rest of the freebooterâ€™s followers were
divided into two strong bands, one destined to watch the remaining
garrison of Inversnaid, a party of which, under Captain Thornton, had
been defeated; and another to show front to the Highland clans who had
united with the regular troops and Lowlanders in this hostile and
combined invasion of that mountainous and desolate territory, which lying
between the lakes of Loch Lomond, Loch Katrine, and Loch Ard, was at this
time currently called Rob Royâ€™s, or the MacGregor country. Messengers
were despatched in great haste, to concentrate, as I supposed, their
forces, with a view to the purposed attack on the Lowlanders; and the
dejection and despair, at first visible on each countenance, gave place
to the hope of rescuing their leader, and to the thirst of vengeance. It
was under the burning influence of the latter passion that the wife of
MacGregor commanded that the hostage exchanged for his safety should be
brought into her presence. I believe her sons had kept this unfortunate
wretch out of her sight, for fear of the consequences; but if it was so,
their humane precaution only postponed his fate. They dragged forward at
her summons a wretch already half dead with terror, in whose agonised
features I recognised, to my horror and astonishment, my old acquaintance
Morris.

He fell prostrate before the female Chief with an effort to clasp her
knees, from which she drew back, as if his touch had been pollution, so
that all he could do in token of the extremity of his humiliation, was to
kiss the hem of her plaid. I never heard entreaties for life poured forth
with such agony of spirit. The ecstasy of fear was such, that instead of
paralysing his tongue, as on ordinary occasions, it even rendered him
eloquent; and, with cheeks pale as ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes
that seemed to be taking their last look of all mortal objects, he
protested, with the deepest oaths, his total ignorance of any design on
the person of Rob Roy, whom he swore he loved and honoured as his own
soul. In the inconsistency of his terror, he said he was but the agent of
others, and he muttered the name of Rashleigh. He prayed but for
life--for life he would give all he had in the world: it was but life he
asked--life, if it were to be prolonged under tortures and privations:
he asked only breath, though it should be drawn in the damps of the
lowest caverns of their hills.

It is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing, and contempt, with
which the wife of MacGregor regarded this wretched petitioner for the
poor boon of existence.

â€œI could have bid ye live,â€ she said, â€œhad life been to you the same
weary and wasting burden that it is to me--that it is to every noble and
generous mind. But you--wretch! you could creep through the world
unaffected by its various disgraces, its ineffable miseries, its
constantly accumulating masses of crime and sorrow: you could live and
enjoy yourself, while the noble-minded are betrayed--while nameless and
birthless villains tread on the neck of the brave and the long-descended:
you could enjoy yourself, like a butcherâ€™s dog in the shambles, battening
on garbage, while the slaughter of the oldest and best went on around
you! This enjoyment you shall not live to partake of!--you shall die,
base dog! and that before yon cloud has passed over the sun.â€

She gave a brief command in Gaelic to her attendants, two of whom seized
upon the prostrate suppliant, and hurried him to the brink of a cliff
which overhung the flood. He set up the most piercing and dreadful cries
that fear ever uttered--I may well term them dreadful, for they haunted
my sleep for years afterwards. As the murderers, or executioners, call
them as you will, dragged him along, he recognised me even in that moment
of horror, and exclaimed, in the last articulate words I ever heard him
utter, â€œOh, Mr. Osbaldistone, save me!--save me!â€

I was so much moved by this horrid spectacle, that, although in momentary
expectation of sharing his fate, I did attempt to speak in his behalf,
but, as might have been expected, my interference was sternly
disregarded. The victim was held fast by some, while others, binding a
large heavy stone in a plaid, tied it round his neck, and others again
eagerly stripped him of some part of his dress. Half-naked, and thus
manacled, they hurled him into the lake, there about twelve feet deep,
with a loud halloo of vindictive triumph,--above which, however, his last
death-shriek, the yell of mortal agony, was distinctly heard. The heavy
burden splashed in the dark-blue waters, and the Highlanders, with their
pole-axes and swords, watched an instant to guard, lest, extricating
himself from the load to which he was attached, the victim might have
struggled to regain the shore. But the knot had been securely bound--the
wretched man sunk without effort; the waters, which his fall had
disturbed, settled calmly over him, and the unit of that life for which
he had pleaded so strongly, was for ever withdrawn from the sum of human
existence.





CHAPTER FIFTEEN.


                And be he safe restored ere evening set,
                Or, if thereâ€™s vengeance in an injured heart,
                And power to wreak it in an armed hand,
                      Your land shall ache forâ€™t.
                                          Old Play.

I know not why it is that a single deed of violence and cruelty affects
our nerves more than when these are exercised on a more extended scale. I
had seen that day several of my brave countrymen fall in battle: it
seemed to me that they met a lot appropriate to humanity, and my bosom,
though thrilling with interest, was affected with nothing of that
sickening horror with which I beheld the unfortunate Morris put to death
without resistance, and in cold blood. I looked at my companion, Mr.
Jarvie, whose face reflected the feelings which were painted in mine.
Indeed he could not so suppress his horror, but that the words escaped
him in a low and broken whisper,--

â€œI take up my protest against this deed, as a bloody and cruel murder--it
is a cursed deed, and God will avenge it in his due way and time.â€

â€œThen you do not fear to follow?â€ said the virago, bending on him a look
of death, such as that with which a hawk looks at his prey ere he
pounces.

â€œKinswoman,â€ said the Bailie, â€œnae man willingly wad cut short his thread
of life before the end oâ€™ his pirn was fairly measured off on the
yarn-winles--And I hae muckle to do, an I be spared, in this
warld--public and private business, as weel that belonging to the
magistracy as to my ain particular; and nae doubt I hae some to depend
on me, as puir Mattie, wha is an orphan--Sheâ€™s a far-awaâ€™ cousin oâ€™ the
Laird oâ€™ Limmerfield. Sae that, laying aâ€™ this thegither--skin for skin,
yea all that a man hath, will he give for his life.â€

â€œAnd were I to set you at liberty,â€ said the imperious dame, â€œwhat name
could you give to the drowning of that Saxon dog?â€

â€œUh! uh!--hem! hem!â€ said the Bailie, clearing his throat as well as he
could, â€œI suld study to say as little on that score as might be--least
said is sunest mended.â€

â€œBut if you were called on by the courts, as you term them, of justice,â€
 she again demanded, â€œwhat then would be your answer?â€

The Bailie looked this way and that way, like a person who meditates an
escape, and then answered in the tone of one who, seeing no means of
accomplishing a retreat, determines to stand the brunt of battle--â€œI see
what you are driving me to the waâ€™ about. But Iâ€™ll tell youâ€™t plain,
kinswoman,--I behoved just to speak according to my ain conscience; and
though your ain gudeman, that I wish had been here for his ain sake and
mine, as wool as the puir Hieland creature Dougal, can tell ye that Nicol
Jarvie can wink as hard at a friendâ€™s failings as onybody, yet Iâ€™se tell
ye, kinswoman, mineâ€™s neâ€™er be the tongue to belie my thought; and sooner
than say that yonder puir wretch was lawfully slaughtered, I wad consent
to be laid beside him--though I think ye are the first Hieland woman wad
mint sic a doom to her husbandâ€™s kinsman but four times removed.â€

It is probable that the tone and firmness assumed by the Bailie in his
last speech was better suited to make an impression on the hard heart of
his kinswoman than the tone of supplication he had hitherto assumed, as
gems can be cut with steel, though they resist softer metals. She
commanded us both to be placed before her. â€œYour name,â€ she said to me,
â€œis Osbaldistone?--the dead dog, whose death you have witnessed, called
you so.â€

â€œMy name _is_ Osbaldistone,â€ was my answer.

â€œRashleigh, then, I suppose, is your Christian name?â€ she pursued.

â€œNo,--my name is Francis.â€

â€œBut you know Rashleigh Osbaldistone,â€ she continued. â€œHe is your
brother, if I mistake not,--at least your kinsman and near friend.â€

â€œHe is my kinsman,â€ I replied, â€œbut not my friend. We were lately engaged
together in a rencontre, when we were separated by a person whom I
understand to be your husband. My blood is hardly yet dried on his sword,
and the wound on my side is yet green. I have little reason to
acknowledge him as a friend.â€

â€œThen,â€ she replied, â€œif a stranger to his intrigues, you can go in
safety to Garschattachin and his party without fear of being detained,
and carry them a message from the wife of the MacGregor?â€

I answered that I knew no reasonable cause why the militia gentlemen
should detain me; that I had no reason, on my own account, to fear being
in their hands; and that if my going on her embassy would act as a
protection to my friend and servant, who were here prisoners, â€œI was
ready to set out directly.â€ I took the opportunity to say, â€œThat I had
come into this country on her husbandâ€™s invitation, and his assurance
that he would aid me in some important matters in which I was interested;
that my companion, Mr. Jarvie, had accompanied me on the same errand.â€

â€œAnd I wish Mr. Jarvieâ€™s boots had been fuâ€™ oâ€™ boiling water when he drew
them on for sic a purpose,â€ interrupted the Bailie.

â€œYou may read your father,â€ said Helen MacGregor, turning to her sons,
â€œin what this young Saxon tells us--Wise only when the bonnet is on his
head, and the sword is in his hand, he never exchanges the tartan for the
broad-cloth, but he runs himself into the miserable intrigues of the
Lowlanders, and becomes again, after all he has suffered, their
agent--their tool--their slave.â€

â€œAdd, madam,â€ said I, â€œand their benefactor.â€

â€œBe it so,â€ she said; â€œfor it is the most empty title of them all, since
he has uniformly sown benefits to reap a harvest of the most foul
ingratitude.--But enough of this. I shall cause you to be guided to the
enemyâ€™s outposts. Ask for their commander, and deliver him this message
from me, Helen MacGregor;--that if they injure a hair of MacGregorâ€™s
head, and if they do not set him at liberty within the space of twelve
hours, there is not a lady in the Lennox but shall before Christmas cry
the coronach for them she will be loath to lose,--there is not a farmer
but shall sing well-a-wa over a burnt barnyard and an empty byre,--there
is not a laird nor heritor shall lay his head on the pillow at night with
the assurance of being a live man in the morning,--and, to begin as we
are to end, so soon as the term is expired, I will send them this Glasgow
Bailie, and this Saxon Captain, and all the rest of my prisoners, each
bundled in a plaid, and chopped into as many pieces as there are checks
in the tartan.â€

As she paused in her denunciation, Captain Thornton, who was within
hearing, added, with great coolness, â€œPresent my compliments--Captain
Thorntonâ€™s of the Royals, compliments--to the commanding officer, and
tell him to do his duty and secure his prisoner, and not waste a thought
upon me. If I have been fool enough to have been led into an ambuscade by
these artful savages, I am wise enough to know how to die for it without
disgracing the service. I am only sorry for my poor fellows,â€ he said,
â€œthat have fallen into such butcherly hands.â€

â€œWhist! whist!â€ exclaimed the Bailie; â€œare ye weary oâ€™ your life?--Yeâ€™ll
gie _my_ service to the commanding officer, Mr. Osbaldistone--Bailie
Nicol Jarvieâ€™s service, a magistrate oâ€™ Glasgow, as his father the deacon
was before him--and tell him, here are a wheen honest men in great
trouble, and like to come to mair; and the best thing he can do for the
common good, will be just to let Rob come his waâ€™s up the glen, and nae
mair about it. Thereâ€™s been some ill dune here already; but as it has
lighted chiefly on the gauger, it winna be muckle worth making a stir
about.â€

With these very opposite injunctions from the parties chiefly interested
in the success of my embassy, and with the reiterated charge of the wife
of MacGregor to remember and detail every word of her injunctions, I was
at length suffered to depart; and Andrew Fairservice, chiefly, I believe,
to get rid of his clamorous supplications, was permitted to attend me.
Doubtful, however, that I might use my horse as a means of escape from my
guides, or desirous to retain a prize of some value, I was given to
understand that I was to perform my journey on foot, escorted by Hamish
MacGregor, the elder brother, who, with two followers, attended, as well
to show me the way, as to reconnoitre the strength and position of the
enemy. Dougal had been at first ordered on this party, but he contrived
to elude the service, with the purpose, as we afterwards understood, of
watching over Mr. Jarvie, whom, according to his wild principles of
fidelity, he considered as entitled to his good offices, from having once
acted in some measure as his patron or master.

After walking with great rapidity about an hour, we arrived at an
eminence covered with brushwood, which gave us a commanding prospect down
the valley, and a full view of the post which the militia occupied. Being
chiefly cavalry, they had judiciously avoided any attempt to penetrate
the pass which had been so unsuccessfully essayed by Captain Thornton.
They had taken up their situation with some military skill, on a rising
ground in the centre of the little valley of Aberfoil, through which the
river Forth winds its earliest course, and which is formed by two ridges
of hills, faced with barricades of limestone rock, intermixed with huge
masses of breecia, or pebbles imbedded in some softer substance which has
hardened around them like mortar; and surrounded by the more lofty
mountains in the distance. These ridges, however, left the valley of
breadth enough to secure the cavalry from any sudden surprise by the
mountaineers and they had stationed sentinels and outposts at proper
distances from this main body, in every direction, so that they might
secure full time to mount and get under arms upon the least alarm. It was
not, indeed, expected at that time, that Highlanders would attack cavalry
in an open plain, though late events have shown that they may do so with
success.

When I first knew the Highlanders, they had almost a superstitious dread
of a mounted trooper, the horse being so much more fierce and imposing in
his appearance than the little shelties of their own hills, and moreover
being trained, as the more ignorant mountaineers believed, to fight with
his feet and his teeth. The appearance of the piequeted horses, feeding
in this little vale--the forms of the soldiers, as they sate, stood, or
walked, in various groups in the vicinity of the beautiful river, and of
the bare yet romantic ranges of rock which hedge in the landscape on
either side,--formed a noble foreground; while far to the eastward the
eye caught a glance of the lake of Menteith; and Stirling Castle, dimly
seen along with the blue and distant line of the Ochil Mountains, closed
the scene.

After gazing on this landscape with great earnestness, young MacGregor
intimated to me that I was to descend to the station of the militia and
execute my errand to their commander,--enjoining me at the same time,
with a menacing gesture, neither to inform them who had guided me to that
place, nor where I had parted from my escort. Thus tutored, I descended
towards the military post, followed by Andrew, who, only retaining his
breeches and stockings of the English costume, without a hat,
bare-legged, with brogues on his feet, which Dougal had given him out of
compassion, and having a tattered plaid to supply the want of all upper
garments, looked as if he had been playing the part of a Highland
Tom-of-Bedlam. We had not proceeded far before we became visible to one
of the videttes, who, riding towards us, presented his carabine and
commanded me to stand. I obeyed, and when the soldier came up, desired to
be conducted to his commanding-officer. I was immediately brought where a
circle of officers, sitting upon the grass, seemed in attendance upon one
of superior rank. He wore a cuirass of polished steel, over which were
drawn the insignia of the ancient Order of the Thistle. My friend
Garschattachin, and many other gentlemen, some in uniform, others in
their ordinary dress, but all armed and well attended, seemed to receive
their orders from this person of distinction. Many servants in rich
liveries, apparently a part of his household, were also in waiting.

Having paid to this nobleman the respect which his rank appeared to
demand, I acquainted him that I had been an involuntary witness to the
kingâ€™s soldiers having suffered a defeat from the Highlanders at the pass
of Loch-Ard (such I had learned was the name of the place where Mr.
Thornton was made prisoner), and that the victors threatened every
species of extremity to those who had fallen into their power, as well as
to the Low Country in general, unless their Chief, who had that morning
been made prisoner, were returned to them uninjured. The Duke (for he
whom I addressed was of no lower rank) listened to me with great
composure, and then replied, that he should be extremely sorry to expose
the unfortunate gentlemen who had been made prisoners to the cruelty of
the barbarians into whose hands they had fallen, but that it was folly to
suppose that he would deliver up the very author of all these disorders
and offences, and so encourage his followers in their license. â€œYou may
return to those who sent you,â€ he proceeded, â€œand inform them, that I
shall certainly cause Rob Roy Campbell, whom they call MacGregor, to be
executed, by break of day, as an outlaw taken in arms, and deserving
death by a thousand acts of violence; that I should be most justly held
unworthy of my situation and commission did I act otherwise; that I shall
know how to protect the country against their insolent threats of
violence; and that if they injure a hair of the head of any of the
unfortunate gentlemen whom an unlucky accident has thrown into their
power, I will take such ample vengeance, that the very stones of their
glens shall sing woe for it this hundred years to come!â€

I humbly begged leave to remonstrate respecting the honourable mission
imposed on me, and touched upon the obvious danger attending it, when the
noble commander replied, â€œthat such being the case, I might send my
servant.â€

â€œThe deil be in my feet,â€ said Andrew, without either having respect to
the presence in which he stood, or waiting till I replied--â€œthe deil be
in my feet, if I gang my taeâ€™s length. Do the folk think I hae another
thrapple in my pouch after John Highlandmanâ€™s sneeked this ane wiâ€™ his
joctaleg? or that I can dive doun at the tae side of a Highland loch and
rise at the tother, like a shell-drake? Na, na--ilk ane for himsell, and
God for us aâ€™. Folk may just make a page oâ€™ their ain age, and serve
themsells till their bairns grow up, and gang their ain errands for
Andrew. Rob Roy never came near the parish of Dreepdaily, to steal either
pippin or pear frae me or mine.â€

Silencing my follower with some difficulty, I represented to the Duke the
great danger Captain Thornton and Mr. Jarvie would certainly be exposed
to, and entreated he would make me the bearer of such modified terms as
might be the means of saving their lives. I assured him I should decline
no danger if I could be of service; but from what I had heard and seen, I
had little doubt they would be instantly murdered should the chief of the
outlaws suffer death.

The Duke was obviously much affected. â€œIt was a hard case,â€ he said, â€œand
he felt it as such; but he had a paramount duty to perform to the
country--Rob Roy must die!â€

I own it was not without emotion that I heard this threat of instant
death to my acquaintance Campbell, who had so often testified his
good-will towards me. Nor was I singular in the feeling, for many of
those around the Duke ventured to express themselves in his favour. â€œIt
would be more advisable,â€ they said, â€œto send him to Stirling Castle, and
there detain him a close prisoner, as a pledge for the submission and
dispersion of his gang. It were a great pity to expose the country to be
plundered, which, now that the long nights approached, it would be found
very difficult to prevent, since it was impossible to guard every point,
and the Highlanders were sure to select those that were left exposed.â€
 They added, that there was great hardship in leaving the unfortunate
prisoners to the almost certain doom of massacre denounced against them,
which no one doubted would be executed in the first burst of revenge.

Garschattachin ventured yet farther, confiding in the honour of the
nobleman whom he addressed, although he knew he had particular reasons
for disliking their prisoner. â€œRob Roy,â€ he said, â€œthough a kittle
neighbour to the Low Country, and particularly obnoxious to his Grace,
and though he maybe carried the catheran trade farther than ony man oâ€™
his day, was an auld-farrand carle, and there might be some means of
making him hear reason; whereas his wife and sons were reckless fiends,
without either fear or mercy about them, and, at the head of aâ€™ his
limmer loons, would be a worse plague to the country than ever he had
been.â€

â€œPooh! pooh!â€ replied his Grace, â€œit is the very sense and cunning of
this fellow which has so long maintained his reign--a mere Highland
robber would have been put down in as many weeks as he has flourished
years. His gang, without him, is no more to be dreaded as a permanent
annoyance--it will no longer exist--than a wasp without its head, which
may sting once perhaps, but is instantly crushed into annihilation.â€

Garschattachin was not so easily silenced. â€œI am sure, my Lord Duke,â€ he
replied, â€œI have no favour for Rob, and he as little for me, seeing he
has twice cleaned out my ain byres, beside skaith amang my tenants; but,
howeverâ€--

â€œBut, however, Garschattachin,â€ said the Duke, with a smile of peculiar
expression, â€œI fancy you think such a freedom may be pardoned in a
friendâ€™s friend, and Robâ€™s supposed to be no enemy to Major Galbraithâ€™s
friends over the water.â€

â€œIf it be so, my lord,â€ said Garschattachin, in the same tone of
jocularity, â€œitâ€™s no the warst thing I have heard of him. But I wish we
heard some news from the clans, that we have waited for sae lang. I vow
to God theyâ€™ll keep a Hielandmanâ€™s word wiâ€™ us--I never kenâ€™d them
better--itâ€™s ill drawing boots upon trews.â€

â€œI cannot believe it,â€ said the Duke. â€œThese gentlemen are known to be
men of honour, and I must necessarily suppose they are to keep their
appointment. Send out two more horse-men to look for our friends. We
cannot, till their arrival, pretend to attack the pass where Captain
Thornton has suffered himself to be surprised, and which, to my
knowledge, ten men on foot might make good against a regiment of the best
horse in Europe--Meanwhile let refreshments be given to the men.â€

I had the benefit of this last order, the more necessary and acceptable,
as I had tasted nothing since our hasty meal at Aberfoil the evening
before. The videttes who had been despatched returned without tidings of
the expected auxiliaries, and sunset was approaching, when a Highlander
belonging to the clans whose co-operation was expected, appeared as the
bearer of a letter, which he delivered to the Duke with a most profound
congeâ€™.

â€œNow will I wad a hogshead of claret,â€ said Garschattachin, â€œthat this is
a message to tell us that these cursed Highlandmen, whom we have fetched
here at the expense of so much plague and vexation, are going to draw
off, and leave us to do our own business if we can.â€

â€œIt is even so, gentlemen,â€ said the Duke, reddening with indignation,
after having perused the letter, which was written upon a very dirty
scrap of paper, but most punctiliously addressed, â€œFor the much-honoured
hands of Ane High and Mighty Prince, the Duke,â€ &c. &c. &c. â€œOur allies,â€
 continued the Duke, â€œhave deserted us, gentlemen, and have made a
separate peace with the enemy.â€

â€œItâ€™s just the fate of all alliances,â€ said Garschattachin, â€œthe Dutch
were gaun to serve us the same gate, if we had not got the start of them
at Utrecht.â€

â€œYou are facetious, air,â€ said the Duke, with a frown which showed how
little he liked the pleasantry; â€œbut our business is rather of a grave
cut just now.--I suppose no gentleman would advise our attempting to
penetrate farther into the country, unsupported either by friendly
Highlanders, or by infantry from Inversnaid?â€

A general answer announced that the attempt would be perfect madness.

â€œNor would there be great wisdom,â€ the Duke added, â€œin remaining exposed
to a night-attack in this place. I therefore propose that we should
retreat to the house of Duchray and that of Gartartan, and keep safe and
sure watch and ward until morning. But before we separate, I will examine
Rob Roy before you all, and make you sensible, by your own eyes and ears,
of the extreme unfitness of leaving him space for farther outrage.â€ He
gave orders accordingly, and the prisoner was brought before him, his
arms belted down above the elbow, and secured to his body by a
horse-girth buckled tight behind him. Two non-commissioned officers had
hold of him, one on each side, and two file of men with carabines and
fixed bayonets attended for additional security.

I had never seen this man in the dress of his country, which set in a
striking point of view the peculiarities of his form. A shock-head of red
hair, which the hat and periwig of the Lowland costume had in a great
measure concealed, was seen beneath the Highland bonnet, and verified the
epithet of _Roy,_ or Red, by which he was much better known in the Low
Country than by any other, and is still, I suppose, best remembered. The
justice of the appellation was also vindicated by the appearance of that
part of his limbs, from the bottom of his kilt to the top of his short
hose, which the fashion of his country dress left bare, and which was
covered with a fell of thick, short, red hair, especially around his
knees, which resembled in this respect, as well as from their sinewy
appearance of extreme strength, the limbs of a red-coloured Highland
bull. Upon the whole, betwixt the effect produced by the change of dress,
and by my having become acquainted with his real and formidable
character, his appearance had acquired to my eyes something so much
wilder and more striking than it before presented, that I could scarce
recognise him to be the same person.

His manner was bold, unconstrained unless by the actual bonds, haughty,
and even dignified. He bowed to the Duke, nodded to Garschattachin and
others, and showed some surprise at seeing me among the party.

â€œIt is long since we have met, Mr. Campbell,â€ said the Duke.

â€œIt is so, my Lord Duke; I could have wished it had beenâ€ (looking at the
fastening on his arms) â€œwhen I could have better paid the compliments I
owe to your Grace;--but thereâ€™s a gude time coming.â€

â€œNo time like the time present, Mr. Campbell,â€ answered the Duke, â€œfor
the hours are fast flying that must settle your last account with all
mortal affairs. I do not say this to insult your distress; but you must
be aware yourself that you draw near the end of your career. I do not
deny that you may sometimes have done less harm than others of your
unhappy trade, and that you may occasionally have exhibited marks of
talent, and even of a disposition which promised better things. But you
are aware how long you have been the terror and the oppressor of a
peaceful neighbourhood, and by what acts of violence you have maintained
and extended your usurped authority. You know, in short, that you have
deserved death, and that you must prepare for it.â€

â€œMy Lord,â€ said Rob Roy, â€œalthough I may well lay my misfortunes at your
Graceâ€™s door, yet I will never say that you yourself have been the wilful
and witting author of them. My Lord, if I had thought sae, your Grace
would not this day have been sitting in judgment on me; for you have been
three times within good rifle distance of me when you were thinking but
of the red deer, and few people have kenâ€™d me miss my aim. But as for
them that have abused your Graceâ€™s ear, and set you up against a man that
was ance as peacefuâ€™ a man as ony in the land, and made your name the
warrant for driving me to utter extremity,--I have had some amends of
them, and, for aâ€™ that your Grace now says, I expect to live to hae
mair.â€

â€œI know,â€ said the Duke, in rising anger, â€œthat you are a determined and
impudent villain, who will keep his oath if he swears to mischief; but it
shall be my care to prevent you. You have no enemies but your own wicked
actions.â€

â€œHad I called myself Grahame, instead of Campbell, I might have heard
less about them,â€ answered Rob Roy, with dogged resolution.

â€œYou will do well, sir,â€ said the Duke, â€œto warn your wife and family and
followers, to beware how they use the gentlemen now in their hands, as I
will requite tenfold on them, and their kin and allies, the slightest
injury done to any of his Majestyâ€™s liege subjects.â€

â€œMy Lord,â€ said Roy in answer, â€œnone of my enemies will allege that I
have been a bloodthirsty man, and were I now wiâ€™ my folk, I could rule
four or five hundred wild Hielanders as easy as your Grace those eight or
ten lackeys and foot-boys--But if your Grace is bent to take the head
away from a house, ye may lay your account there will be misrule amang
the members.--However, come oâ€™t what like, thereâ€™s an honest man, a
kinsman oâ€™ my ain, maun come by nae skaith. Is there ony body here wad do
a gude deed for MacGregor?--he may repay it, though his hands be now
tied.â€

The Highlander who had delivered the letter to the Duke replied, â€œIâ€™ll do
your will for you, MacGregor; and Iâ€™ll gang back up the glen on purpose.â€

He advanced, and received from the prisoner a message to his wife, which,
being in Gaelic, I did not understand, but I had little doubt it related
to some measures to be taken for the safety of Mr. Jarvie.

â€œDo you hear the fellowâ€™s impudence?â€ said the Duke; â€œhe confides in his
character of a messenger. His conduct is of a piece with his masterâ€™s,
who invited us to make common cause against these freebooters, and have
deserted us so soon as the MacGregors have agreed to surrender the
Balquhidder lands they were squabbling about.

             No truth in plaids, no faith in tartan trews!
             Chameleon-like, they change a thousand hues.â€

â€œYour great ancestor never said so, my Lord,â€ answered Major
Galbraith;--â€œand, with submission, neither would your Grace have
occasion to say it, wad ye but be for beginning justice at the
well-head--Gie the honest man his mear again--Let every head wear itâ€™s
ane bannet, and the distractions oâ€™ the Lennox wad be mended wiâ€™ them
oâ€™the land.â€

â€œHush! hush! Garschattachin,â€ said the Duke; â€œthis is language dangerous
for you to talk to any one, and especially to me; but I presume you
reckon yourself a privileged person. Please to draw off your party
towards Gartartan; I shall myself see the prisoner escorted to Duchray,
and send you orders tomorrow. You will please grant no leave of absence
to any of your troopers.â€

â€œHereâ€™s auld ordering and counter-ordering,â€ muttered Garschattachin
between his teeth. â€œBut patience! patience!--we may ae day play at change
seats, the kingâ€™s coming.â€

The two troops of cavalry now formed, and prepared to march off the
ground, that they might avail themselves of the remainder of daylight to
get to their evening quarters. I received an intimation, rather than an
invitation, to attend the party; and I perceived, that, though no longer
considered as a prisoner, I was yet under some sort of suspicion. The
times were indeed so dangerous,--the great party questions of Jacobite
and Hanoverian divided the country so effectually,--and the constant
disputes and jealousies between the Highlanders and Lowlanders, besides a
number of inexplicable causes of feud which separated the great leading
families in Scotland from each other, occasioned such general suspicion,
that a solitary and unprotected stranger was almost sure to meet with
something disagreeable in the course of his travels.

I acquiesced, however, in my destination with the best grace I could,
consoling myself with the hope that I might obtain from the captive
freebooter some information concerning Rashleigh and his machinations. I
should do myself injustice did I not add, that my views were not merely
selfish. I was too much interested in my singular acquaintance not to be
desirous of rendering him such services as his unfortunate situation
might demand, or admit of his receiving.





CHAPTER SIXTEEN.

                   And when he came to broken brigg,
                       He bent his bow and swam;
                   And when he came to grass growing,
                       Set down his feet and ran.
                                     Gil Morrice.

The echoes of the rocks and ravines, on either side, now rang to the
trumpets of the cavalry, which, forming themselves into two distinct
bodies, began to move down the valley at a slow trot. That commanded by
Major Galbraith soon took to the right hand, and crossed the Forth, for
the purpose of taking up the quarters assigned them for the night, when
they were to occupy, as I understood, an old castle in the vicinity. They
formed a lively object while crossing the stream, but were soon lost in
winding up the bank on the opposite side, which was clothed with wood.

We continued our march with considerable good order. To ensure the safe
custody of the prisoner, the Duke had caused him to be placed on
horseback behind one of his retainers, called, as I was informed, Ewan of
Brigglands, one of the largest and strongest men who were present. A
horse-belt, passed round the bodies of both, and buckled before the
yeomanâ€™s breast, rendered it impossible for Rob Roy to free himself from
his keeper. I was directed to keep close beside them, and accommodated
for the purpose with a troop-horse. We were as closely surrounded by the
soldiers as the width of the road would permit, and had always at least
one, if not two, on each side, with pistol in hand. Andrew Fairservice,
furnished with a Highland pony, of which they had made prey somewhere or
other, was permitted to ride among the other domestics, of whom a great
number attended the line of march, though without falling into the ranks
of the more regularly trained troopers.

In this manner we travelled for a certain distance, until we arrived at a
place where we also were to cross the river. The Forth, as being the
outlet of a lake, is of considerable depth, even where less important in
point of width, and the descent to the ford was by a broken precipitous
ravine, which only permitted one horseman to descend at once. The rear
and centre of our small body halting on the bank while the front files
passed down in succession, produced a considerable delay, as is usual on
such occasions, and even some confusion; for a number of those riders,
who made no proper part of the squadron, crowded to the ford without
regularity, and made the militia cavalry, although tolerably well
drilled, partake in some degree of their own disorder.


It was while we were thus huddled together on the bank that I heard Rob
Roy whisper to the man behind whom he was placed on horseback, â€œYour
father, Ewan, wadna hae carried an auld friend to the shambles, like a
calf, for aâ€™ the Dukes in Christendom.â€

Ewan returned no answer, but shrugged, as one who would express by that
sign that what he was doing was none of his own choice.

â€œAnd when the MacGregors come down the glen, and ye see toom faulds, a
bluidy hearthstone, and the fire flashing out between the rafters oâ€™ your
house, ye may be thinking then, Ewan, that were your friend Rob to the
fore, you would have had that safe which it will make your heart sair to
lose.â€

Ewan of Brigglands again shrugged and groaned, but remained silent.

â€œItâ€™s a sair thing,â€ continued Rob, sliding his insinuations so gently
into Ewanâ€™s ear that they reached no other but mine, who certainly saw
myself in no shape called upon to destroy his prospects of escape--â€œItâ€™s
a sair thing, that Ewan of Brigglands, whom Roy MacGregor has helped with
hand, sword, and purse, suld mind a gloom from a great man mair than a
friendâ€™s life.â€

Ewan seemed sorely agitated, but was silent.--We heard the Dukeâ€™s voice
from the opposite bank call, â€œBring over the prisoner.â€

Ewan put his horse in motion, and just as I heard Roy say, â€œNever weigh a
MacGregorâ€™s bluid against a broken whang oâ€™ leather, for there will be
another accounting to gie for it baith here and hereafter,â€ they passed
me hastily, and dashing forward rather precipitately, entered the water.

â€œNot yet, sir--not yet,â€ said some of the troopers to me, as I was about
to follow, while others pressed forward into the stream.

I saw the Duke on the other side, by the waning light, engaged in
commanding his people to get into order, as they landed dispersedly, some
higher, some lower. Many had crossed, some were in the water, and the
rest were preparing to follow, when a sudden splash warned me that
MacGregorâ€™s eloquence had prevailed on Ewan to give him freedom and a
chance for life. The Duke also heard the sound, and instantly guessed its
meaning. â€œDog!â€ he exclaimed to Ewan as he landed, â€œwhere is your
prisoner?â€ and, without waiting to hear the apology which the terrified
vassal began to falter forth, he fired a pistol at his head, whether
fatally I know not, and exclaimed, â€œGentlemen, disperse and pursue the
villain--An hundred guineas for him that secures Rob Roy!â€

All became an instant scene of the most lively confusion. Rob Roy,
disengaged from his bonds, doubtless by Ewanâ€™s slipping the buckle of his
belt, had dropped off at the horseâ€™s tail, and instantly dived, passing
under the belly of the troop-horse which was on his left hand. But as he
was obliged to come to the surface an instant for air, the glimpse of his
tartan plaid drew the attention of the troopers, some of whom plunged
into the river, with a total disregard to their own safety, rushing,
according to the expression of their country, through pool and stream,
sometimes swimming their horses, sometimes losing them and struggling for
their own lives. Others, less zealous or more prudent, broke off in
different directions, and galloped up and down the banks, to watch the
places at which the fugitive might possibly land. The hollowing, the
whooping, the calls for aid at different points, where they saw, or
conceived they saw, some vestige of him they were seeking,--the frequent
report of pistols and carabines, fired at every object which excited the
least suspicion,--the sight of so many horsemen riding about, in and out
of the river, and striking with their long broadswords at whatever
excited their attention, joined to the vain exertions used by their
officers to restore order and regularity,--and all this in so wild a
scene, and visible only by the imperfect twilight of an autumn evening,
made the most extraordinary hubbub I had hitherto witnessed. I was indeed
left alone to observe it, for our whole cavalcade had dispersed in
pursuit, or at least to see the event of the search. Indeed, as I partly
suspected at the time, and afterwards learned with certainty, many of
those who seemed most active in their attempts to waylay and recover the
fugitive, were, in actual truth, least desirous that he should be taken,
and only joined in the cry to increase the general confusion, and to give
Rob Roy a better opportunity of escaping.

Escape, indeed, was not difficult for a swimmer so expert as the
freebooter, as soon as he had eluded the first burst of pursuit. At one
time he was closely pressed, and several blows were made which flashed in
the water around him; the scene much resembling one of the otter-hunts
which I had seen at Osbaldistone Hall, where the animal is detected by
the hounds from his being necessitated to put his nose above the stream
to vent or breathe, while he is enabled to elude them by getting under
water again so soon as he has refreshed himself by respiration.
MacGregor, however, had a trick beyond the otter; for he contrived, when
very closely pursued, to disengage himself unobserved from his plaid, and
suffer it to float down the stream, where in its progress it quickly
attracted general attention; many of the horsemen were thus put upon a
false scent, and several shots or stabs were averted from the party for
whom they were designed.

Once fairly out of view, the recovery of the prisoner became almost
impossible, since, in so many places, the river was rendered inaccessible
by the steepness of its banks, or the thickets of alders, poplars, and
birch, which, overhanging its banks, prevented the approach of horsemen.
Errors and accidents had also happened among the pursuers, whose task the
approaching night rendered every moment more hopeless. Some got
themselves involved in the eddies of the stream, and required the
assistance of their companions to save them from drowning. Others, hurt
by shots or blows in the confused meleâ€™e, implored help or threatened
vengeance, and in one or two instances such accidents led to actual
strife. The trumpets, therefore, sounded the retreat, announcing that the
commanding officer, with whatsoever unwillingness, had for the present
relinquished hopes of the important prize which had thus unexpectedly
escaped his grasp, and the troopers began slowly, reluctantly, and
brawling with each other as they returned, again to assume their ranks. I
could see them darkening, as they formed on the southern bank of the
river,--whose murmurs, long drowned by the louder cries of vengeful
pursuit, were now heard hoarsely mingling with the deep, discontented,
and reproachful voices of the disappointed horsemen.

Hitherto I had been as it were a mere spectator, though far from an
uninterested one, of the singular scene which had passed. But now I heard
a voice suddenly exclaim, â€œWhere is the English stranger?--It was he gave
Rob Roy the knife to cut the belt.â€

â€œCleeve the pock-pudding to the chafts!â€ cried one voice.

â€œWeize a brace of balls through his harn-pan!â€ said a second.

â€œDrive three inches of cauld airn into his brisket!â€ shouted a third.

And I heard several horses galloping to and fro, with the kind purpose,
doubtless, of executing these denunciations. I was immediately awakened
to the sense of my situation, and to the certainty that armed men, having
no restraint whatever on their irritated and inflamed passions, would
probably begin by shooting or cutting me down, and afterwards investigate
the justice of the action. Impressed by this belief, I leaped from my
horse, and turning him loose, plunged into a bush of alder-trees, where,
considering the advancing obscurity of the night, I thought there was
little chance of my being discovered. Had I been near enough to the Duke
to have invoked his personal protection, I would have done so; but he had
already commenced his retreat, and I saw no officer on the left bank of
the river, of authority sufficient to have afforded protection, in case
of my surrendering myself. I thought there was no point of honour which
could require, in such circumstances, an unnecessary exposure of my life.
My first idea, when the tumult began to be appeased, and the clatter of
the horsesâ€™ feet was heard less frequently in the immediate vicinity of
my hiding-place, was to seek out the Dukeâ€™s quarters when all should be
quiet, and give myself up to him, as a liege subject, who had nothing to
fear from his justice, and a stranger, who had every right to expect
protection and hospitality. With this purpose I crept out of my
hiding-place, and looked around me.

The twilight had now melted nearly into darkness; a few or none of the
troopers were left on my side of the Forth, and of those who were already
across it, I only heard the distant trample of the horsesâ€™ feet, and the
wailing and prolonged sound of their trumpets, which rung through the
woods to recall stragglers. Here, therefore, I was left in a situation of
considerable difficulty. I had no horse, and the deep and wheeling stream
of the river, rendered turbid by the late tumult of which its channel had
been the scene, and seeming yet more so under the doubtful influence of
an imperfect moonlight, had no inviting influence for a pedestrian by no
means accustomed to wade rivers, and who had lately seen horsemen
weltering, in this dangerous passage, up to the very saddle-laps. At the
same time, my prospect, if I remained on the side of the river on which I
then stood, could be no other than of concluding the various fatigues of
this day and the preceding night, by passing that which was now closing
in, _al fresco_ on the side of a Highland hill.

After a momentâ€™s reflection, I began to consider that Fairservice, who
had doubtless crossed the river with the other domestics, according to
his forward and impertinent custom of putting himself always among the
foremost, could not fail to satisfy the Duke, or the competent
authorities, respecting my rank and situation; and that, therefore, my
character did not require my immediate appearance, at the risk of being
drowned in the river--of being unable to trace the march of the squadron
in case of my reaching the other side in safety--or, finally, of being
cut down, right or wrong, by some straggler, who might think such a piece
of good service a convenient excuse for not sooner rejoining his ranks. I
therefore resolved to measure my steps back to the little inn, where I
had passed the preceding night. I had nothing to apprehend from Rob Roy.
He was now at liberty, and I was certain, in case of my falling in with
any of his people, the news of his escape would ensure me protection. I
might thus also show, that I had no intention to desert Mr. Jarvie in the
delicate situation in which he had engaged himself chiefly on my account.
And lastly, it was only in this quarter that I could hope to learn
tidings concerning Rashleigh and my fatherâ€™s papers, which had been the
original cause of an expedition so fraught with perilous adventure. I
therefore abandoned all thoughts of crossing the Forth that evening; and,
turning my back on the Fords of Frew, began to retrace my steps towards
the little village of Aberfoil.

A sharp frost-wind, which made itself heard and felt from time to time,
removed the clouds of mist which might otherwise have slumbered till
morning on the valley; and, though it could not totally disperse the
clouds of vapour, yet threw them in confused and changeful masses, now
hovering round the heads of the mountains, now filling, as with a dense
and voluminous stream of smoke, the various deep gullies where masses of
the composite rock, or breccia, tumbling in fragments from the cliffs,
have rushed to the valley, leaving each behind its course a rent and torn
ravine resembling a deserted water-course. The moon, which was now high,
and twinkled with all the vivacity of a frosty atmosphere, silvered the
windings of the river and the peaks and precipices which the mist left
visible, while her beams seemed as it were absorbed by the fleecy
whiteness of the mist, where it lay thick and condensed; and gave to the
more light and vapoury specks, which were elsewhere visible, a sort of
filmy transparency resembling the lightest veil of silver gauze. Despite
the uncertainty of my situation, a view so romantic, joined to the active
and inspiring influence of the frosty atmosphere, elevated my spirits
while it braced my nerves. I felt an inclination to cast care away, and
bid defiance to danger, and involuntarily whistled, by way of cadence to
my steps, which my feeling of the cold led me to accelerate, and I felt
the pulse of existence beat prouder and higher in proportion as I felt
confidence in my own strength, courage, and resources. I was so much lost
in these thoughts, and in the feelings which they excited, that two
horsemen came up behind me without my hearing their approach, until one
was on each side of me, when the left-hand rider, pulling up his horse,
addressed me in the English tongue--â€œSo ho, friend! whither so late?â€

â€œTo my supper and bed at Aberfoil,â€ I replied.

â€œAre the passes open?â€ he inquired, with the same commanding tone of
voice.

â€œI do not know,â€ I replied; â€œI shall learn when I get there. But,â€ I
added, the fate of Morris recurring to my recollection, â€œif you are an
English stranger, I advise you to turn back till daylight; there has been
some disturbance in this neighbourhood, and I should hesitate to say it
is perfectly safe for strangers.â€

â€œThe soldiers had the worst?--had they not?â€ was the reply.

â€œThey had indeed; and an officerâ€™s party were destroyed or made
prisoners.â€

â€œAre you sure of that?â€ replied the horseman.

â€œAs sure as that I hear you speak,â€ I replied. â€œI was an unwilling
spectator of the skirmish.â€

â€œUnwilling!â€ continued the interrogator. â€œWere you not engaged in it
then?â€

â€œCertainly no,â€ I replied; â€œI was detained by the kingâ€™s officer.â€

â€œOn what suspicion? and who are you? or what is your name?â€ he continued.

â€œI really do not know, sir,â€ said I, â€œwhy I should answer so many
questions to an unknown stranger. I have told you enough to convince you
that you are going into a dangerous and distracted country. If you choose
to proceed, it is your own affair; but as I ask you no questions
respecting your name and business, you will oblige me by making no
inquiries after mine.â€

â€œMr. Francis Osbaldistone,â€ said the other rider, in a voice the tones of
which thrilled through every nerve of my body, â€œshould not whistle his
favourite airs when he wishes to remain undiscovered.â€

And Diana Vernon--for she, wrapped in a horsemanâ€™s cloak, was the last
speaker--whistled in playful mimicry the second part of the tune which
was on my lips when they came up.

â€œGood God!â€ I exclaimed, like one thunderstruck, â€œcan it be you, Miss
Vernon, on such a spot--at such an hour--in such a lawless country--in
suchâ€--

â€œIn such a masculine dress, you would say.--But what would you have? The
philosophy of the excellent Corporal Nym is the best after all; things
must be as they may--_pauca verba._â€

While she was thus speaking, I eagerly took advantage of an unusually
bright gleam of moonshine, to study the appearance of her companion; for
it may be easily supposed, that finding Miss Vernon in a place so
solitary, engaged in a journey so dangerous, and under the protection of
one gentleman only, were circumstances to excite every feeling of
jealousy, as well as surprise. The rider did not speak with the deep
melody of Rashleighâ€™s voice; his tones were more high and commanding; he
was taller, moreover, as he sate on horseback, than that first-rate
object of my hate and suspicion. Neither did the strangerâ€™s address
resemble that of any of my other cousins; it had that indescribable tone
and manner by which we recognise a man of sense and breeding, even in the
first few sentences he speaks.

The object of my anxiety seemed desirous to get rid of my investigation.

â€œDiana,â€ he said, in a tone of mingled kindness and authority, â€œgive your
cousin his property, and let us not spend time here.â€

Miss Vernon had in the meantime taken out a small case, and leaning down
from her horse towards me, she said, in a tone in which an effort at her
usual quaint lightness of expression contended with a deeper and more
grave tone of sentiment, â€œYou see, my dear coz, I was born to be your
better angel. Rashleigh has been compelled to yield up his spoil, and had
we reached this same village of Aberfoil last night, as we purposed, I
should have found some Highland sylph to have wafted to you all these
representatives of commercial wealth. But there were giants and dragons
in the way; and errant-knights and damsels of modern times, bold though
they be, must not, as of yore, run into useless danger--Do not you do so
either, my dear coz.â€

â€œDiana,â€ said her companion, â€œlet me once more warn you that the evening
waxes late, and we are still distant from our home.â€

â€œI am coming, sir, I am coming--Consider,â€ she added, with a sigh, â€œhow
lately I have been subjected to control--besides, I have not yet given my
cousin the packet, and bid him fare-well--for ever. Yes, Frank,â€ she
said, â€œfor ever!--there is a gulf between us--a gulf of absolute
perdition;--where we go, you must not follow--what we do, you must not
share in--Farewell--be happy!â€

In the attitude in which she bent from her horse, which was a Highland
pony, her face, not perhaps altogether unwillingly, touched mine. She
pressed my hand, while the tear that trembled in her eye found its
way to my cheek instead of her own. It was a moment never to be
forgotten--inexpressibly bitter, yet mixed with a sensation of pleasure
so deeply soothing and affecting, as at once to unlock all the
flood-gates of the heart. It was _but_ a moment, however; for, instantly
recovering from the feeling to which she had involuntarily given way,
she intimated to her companion she was ready to attend him, and putting
their horses to a brisk pace, they were soon far distant from the place
where I stood.

Heaven knows, it was not apathy which loaded my frame and my tongue so
much, that I could neither return Miss Vernonâ€™s half embrace, nor even
answer her farewell. The word, though it rose to my tongue, seemed to
choke in my throat like the fatal _guilty,_ which the delinquent who
makes it his plea, knows must be followed by the doom of death. The
surprise--the sorrow, almost stupified me. I remained motionless with the
packet in my hand, gazing after them, as if endeavouring to count the
sparkles which flew from the horsesâ€™ hoofs. I continued to look after
even these had ceased to be visible, and to listen for their footsteps
long after the last distant trampling had died in my ears. At length,
tears rushed to my eyes, glazed as they were by the exertion of straining
after what was no longer to be seen. I wiped them mechanically, and
almost without being aware that they were flowing--but they came thicker
and thicker; I felt the tightening of the throat and breast--the
_hysterica passio_ of poor Lear; and sitting down by the wayside, I shed
a flood of the first and most bitter tears which had flowed from my eyes
since childhood.






CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.


     _Dangle._--Egad, I think the interpreter is the harder to be
          understood of the two.
                                        Critic.

I had scarce given vent to my feelings in this paroxysm, ere was ashamed
of my weakness. I remembered that I had been for some time endeavouring
to regard Diana Vernon, when her idea intruded itself on my remembrance,
as a friend, for whose welfare I should indeed always be anxious, but
with whom I could have little further communication. But the almost
unrepressed tenderness of her manner, joined to the romance of our sudden
meeting where it was so little to have been expected, were circumstances
which threw me entirely off my guard. I recovered, however, sooner than
might have been expected, and without giving myself time accurately to
examine my motives. I resumed the path on which I had been travelling
when overtaken by this strange and unexpected apparition.

â€œI am not,â€ was my reflection, â€œtransgressing her injunction so
pathetically given, since I am but pursuing my own journey by the only
open route.--If I have succeeded in recovering my fatherâ€™s property, it
still remains incumbent on me to see my Glasgow friend delivered from the
situation in which he has involved himself on my account; besides, what
other place of rest can I obtain for the night excepting at the little
inn of Aberfoil? They also must stop there, since it is impossible for
travellers on horseback to go farther--Well, then, we shall meet
again--meet for the last time perhaps--But I shall see and hear her--I
shall learn who this happy man is who exercises over her the authority
of a husband--I shall learn if there remains, in the difficult course in
which she seems engaged, any difficulty which my efforts may remove, or
aught that I can do to express my gratitude for her generosity--for her
disinterested friendship.â€

As I reasoned thus with myself, colouring with every plausible pretext
which occurred to my ingenuity my passionate desire once more to see and
converse with my cousin, I was suddenly hailed by a touch on the
shoulder; and the deep voice of a Highlander, who, walking still faster
than I, though I was proceeding at a smart pace, accosted me with, â€œA
braw night, Maister Osbaldistone--we have met at the mirk hour before
now.â€

There was no mistaking the tone of MacGregor; he had escaped the pursuit
of his enemies, and was in full retreat to his own wilds and to his
adherents. He had also contrived to arm himself, probably at the house of
some secret adherent, for he had a musket on his shoulder, and the usual
Highland weapons by his side. To have found myself alone with such a
character in such a situation, and at this late hour in the evening,
might not have been pleasant to me in any ordinary mood of mind; for,
though habituated to think of Rob Roy in rather a friendly point of view,
I will confess frankly that I never heard him speak but that it seemed to
thrill my blood. The intonation of the mountaineers gives a habitual
depth and hollowness to the sound of their words, owing to the guttural
expression so common in their native language, and they usually speak
with a good deal of emphasis. To these national peculiarities Rob Roy
added a sort of hard indifference of accent and manner, expressive of a
mind neither to be daunted, nor surprised, nor affected by what passed
before him, however dreadful, however sudden, however afflicting.
Habitual danger, with unbounded confidence in his own strength and
sagacity, had rendered him indifferent to fear, and the lawless and
precarious life he led had blunted, though its dangers and errors had not
destroyed, his feelings for others. And it was to be remembered that I
had very lately seen the followers of this man commit a cruel slaughter
on an unarmed and suppliant individual.

Yet such was the state of my mind, that I welcomed the company of the
outlaw leader as a relief to my own overstrained and painful thoughts;
and was not without hopes that through his means I might obtain some clew
of guidance through the maze in which my fate had involved me. I
therefore answered his greeting cordially, and congratulated him on his
late escape in circumstances when escape seemed impossible.

â€œAy,â€ he replied, â€œthere is as much between the craig and the woodie as
there is between the cup and the lip. But my peril was less than you may
think, being a stranger to this country.

Of those that were summoned to take me, and to keep me, and to retake me
again, there was a moiety, as cousin Nicol Jarvie calls it, that had nae
will that I suld be either taen, or keepit fast, or retaen; and of tother
moiety, there was as half was feared to stir me; and so I had only like
the fourth part of fifty or sixty men to deal withal.â€

â€œAnd enough, too, I should think,â€ replied I.

â€œI dinna ken that,â€ said he; â€œbut I ken, that turn every ill-willer that
I had amang them out upon the green before the Clachan of Aberfoil, I wad
find them play with broadsword and target, one down and another come on.â€

He now inquired into my adventures since we entered his country, and
laughed heartily at my account of the battle we had in the inn, and at
the exploits of the Bailie with the red-hot poker.

â€œLet Glasgow Flourish!â€ he exclaimed. â€œThe curse of Cromwell on me, if I
wad hae wished better sport than to see cousin Nicol Jarvie singe
Iverachâ€™s plaid, like a sheepâ€™s head between a pair of tongs. But my
cousin Jarvie,â€ he added, more gravely, â€œhas some gentlemanâ€™s bluid in
his veins, although he has been unhappily bred up to a peaceful and
mechanical craft, which could not but blunt any pretty manâ€™s spirit.--Ye
may estimate the reason why I could not receive you at the Clachan of
Aberfoil as I purposed. They had made a fine hosenet for me when I was
absent twa or three days at Glasgow, upon the kingâ€™s business--But I
think I broke up the league about their lugs--theyâ€™ll no be able to hound
one clan against another as they hae dune. I hope soon to see the day
when aâ€™ Hielandmen will stand shouther to shouther. But what chanced
next?â€

I gave him an account of the arrival of Captain Thornton and his party,
and the arrest of the Bailie and myself under pretext of our being
suspicious persons; and upon his more special inquiry, I recollected the
officer had mentioned that, besides my name sounding suspicious in his
ears, he had orders to secure an old and young person, resembling our
description. This again moved the outlawâ€™s risibility.

â€œAs man lives by bread,â€ he said, â€œthe buzzards have mistaen my friend
the Bailie for his Excellency, and you for Diana Vernon--O, the most
egregious night-howlets!â€

â€œMiss Vernon?â€ said I, with hesitation, and trembling for the
answer--â€œDoes she still bear that name? She passed but now, along with
a gentleman who seemed to use a style of authority.â€

â€œAy, ay,â€ answered Rob, â€œsheâ€™s under lawfuâ€™ authority now; and full time,
for she was a daft hempie--But sheâ€™s a mettle quean. Itâ€™s a pity his
Excellency is a thought eldern. The like oâ€™ yourself, or my son Hamish,
wad be mair sortable in point of years.â€

Here, then, was a complete downfall of those castles of cards which my
fancy had, in despite of my reason, so often amused herself with
building. Although in truth I had scarcely anything else to expect, since
I could not suppose that Diana could be travelling in such a country, at
such an hour, with any but one who had a legal title to protect her, I
did not feel the blow less severely when it came; and MacGregorâ€™s voice,
urging me to pursue my story, sounded in my ears without conveying any
exact import to my mind.

â€œYou are ill,â€ he said at length, after he had spoken twice without
receiving an answer; â€œthis dayâ€™s wark has been ower muckle for ane
doubtless unused to sic things.â€

The tone of kindness in which this was spoken, recalling me to myself,
and to the necessities of my situation, I continued my narrative as well
as I could. Rob Roy expressed great exultation at the successful skirmish
in the pass.

â€œThey say,â€ he observed, â€œthat kingâ€™s chaff is better than other folkâ€™s
corn; but I think that canna be said oâ€™ kingâ€™s soldiers, if they let
themselves be beaten wiâ€™ a wheen auld carles that are past fighting, and
bairns that are no come tillâ€™t, and wives wiâ€™ their rocks and distaffs,
the very wally-draigles oâ€™ the countryside. And Dougal Gregor, too--wha
wad hae thought there had been as muckle sense in his tatty-pow, that
neâ€™er had a better covering than his ain shaggy hassock of hair!--But say
away--though I dread whatâ€™s to come neist--for my Helenâ€™s an incarnate
devil when her bluidâ€™s up--puir thing, she has ower muckle reason.â€

I observed as much delicacy as I could in communicating to him the usage
we had received, but I obviously saw the detail gave him great pain.

â€œI wad rather than a thousand merks,â€ he said, â€œthat I had been at hame!
To misguide strangers, and forbye aâ€™, my ain natural cousin, that had
showed me sic kindness--I wad rather they had burned half the Lennox in
their folly! But this comes oâ€™ trusting women and their bairns, that have
neither measure nor reason in their dealings. However, itâ€™s aâ€™ owing to
that dog of a gauger, wha betrayed me by pretending a message from your
cousin Rashleigh, to meet him on the kingâ€™s affairs, whilk I thought was
very like to be anent Garschattachin and a party of the Lennox declaring
themselves for King James. Faith! but I kenâ€™d I was clean beguiled when I
heard the Duke was there; and when they strapped the horse-girth ower my
arms, I might hae judged what was biding me; for I kenâ€™d your kinsman,
being, wiâ€™ pardon, a slippery loon himself, is prone to employ those of
his ain kidney--I wish he mayna hae been at the bottom oâ€™ the ploy
himsell--I thought the chield Morris looked devilish queer when I
determined he should remain a wad, or hostage, for my safe back-coming.
But I _am_ come back, nae thanks to him, or them that employed him; and
the question is, how the collector loon is to win back himsell--I promise
him it will not be without a ransom.â€

â€œMorris,â€ said I, â€œhas already paid the last ransom which mortal man can
owe.â€

â€œEh! What?â€ exclaimed my companion hastily; â€œwhat dâ€™ye say? I trust it
was in the skirmish he was killed?â€

â€œHe was slain in cold blood after the fight was over, Mr. Campbell.â€

â€œCold blood?--Damnation!â€ he said, muttering betwixt his teeth--â€œHow fell
that, sir? Speak out, sir, and do not Maister or Campbell me--my foot is
on my native heath, and my name is MacGregor!â€

His passions were obviously irritated; but without noticing the rudeness
of his tone, I gave him a short and distinct account of the death of
Morris. He struck the butt of his gun with great vehemence against the
ground, and broke out--â€œI vow to God, such a deed might make one forswear
kin, clan, country, wife, and bairns! And yet the villain wrought long
for it. And what is the difference between warsling below the water wiâ€™ a
stane about your neck, and wavering in the wind wiâ€™ a tether round
it?--itâ€™s but choking after aâ€™, and he drees the doom he ettled for me. I
could have wished, though, they had rather putten a ball through him, or
a dirk; for the fashion of removing him will give rise to mony idle
clavers--But every wight has his weird, and we maun aâ€™ dee when our day
comes--And naebody will deny that Helen MacGregor has deep wrongs to
avenge.â€

So saying, he seemed to dismiss the theme altogether from his mind, and
proceeded to inquire how I got free from the party in whose hands he had
seen me.

My story was soon told; and I added the episode of my having recovered
the papers of my father, though I dared not trust my voice to name the
name of Diana.

â€œI was sure ye wad get them,â€ said MacGregor;--â€œthe letter ye brought me
contained his Excellencyâ€™s pleasure to that effect and nae doubt it was
my will to have aided in it. And I asked ye up into this glen on the very
errand. But itâ€™s like his Excellency has foregathered wiâ€™ Rashleigh
sooner than I expected.â€

The first part of this answer was what most forcibly struck me.

â€œWas the letter I brought you, then, from this person you call his
Excellency? Who is he? and what is his rank and proper name?â€

â€œI am thinking,â€ said MacGregor, â€œthat since ye dinna ken them already
they canna be oâ€™ muckle consequence to you, and sae I shall say naething
on that score. But weel I wot the letter was frae his ain hand, or,
having a sort of business of my ain on my hands, being, as ye weel may
see, just as much as I can fairly manage, I canna say I would hae fashed
mysell sae muckle about the matter.â€

I now recollected the lights seen in the library--the various
circumstances which had excited my jealousy--the glove--the agitation of
the tapestry which covered the secret passage from Rashleighâ€™s apartment;
and, above all, I recollected that Diana retired in order to write, as I
then thought, the billet to which I was to have recourse in case of the
last necessity. Her hours, then, were not spent in solitude, but in
listening to the addresses of some desperate agent of Jacobitical
treason, who was a secret resident within the mansion of her uncle! Other
young women have sold themselves for gold, or suffered themselves to be
seduced from their first love from vanity; but Diana had sacrificed my
affections and her own to partake the fortunes of some desperate
adventurer--to seek the haunts of freebooters through midnight deserts,
with no better hopes of rank or fortune than that mimicry of both which
the mock court of the Stuarts at St. Germains had in their power to
bestow.

â€œI will see her,â€ I said internally, â€œif it be possible, once more. I
will argue with her as a friend--as a kinsman--on the risk she is
incurring, and I will facilitate her retreat to France, where she may,
with more comfort and propriety, as well as safety, abide the issue of
the turmoils which the political trepanner, to whom she has united her
fate, is doubtless busied in putting into motion.â€

â€œI conclude, then,â€ I said to MacGregor, after about five minutesâ€™
silence on both sides, â€œthat his Excellency, since you give me no other
name for him, was residing in Osbaldistone Hall at the same time with
myself?â€

â€œTo be sure--to be sure--and in the young ladyâ€™s apartment, as best
reason was.â€ This gratuitous information was adding gall to bitterness.
â€œBut few,â€ added MacGregor, â€œkenâ€™d he was derned there, save Rashleigh
and Sir Hildebrand; for you were out oâ€™ the question; and the young lads
haena wit eneugh to caâ€™ the cat frae the cream--But itâ€™s a braâ€™
auld-fashioned house, and what I specially admire is the abundance oâ€™
holes and bores and concealments--ye could put twenty or thirty men in ae
corner, and a family might live a week without finding them out--whilk,
nae doubt, may on occasion be a special convenience. I wish we had the
like oâ€™ Osbaldistone Hall on the braes oâ€™ Craig-Royston--But we maun gar
woods and caves serve the like oâ€™ us puir Hieland bodies.â€

â€œI suppose his Excellency,â€ said I, â€œwas privy to the first accident
which befellâ€--

I could not help hesitating a moment.

â€œYe were going to say Morris,â€ said Rob Roy coolly, for he was too much
accustomed to deeds of violence for the agitation he had at first
expressed to be of long continuance. â€œI used to laugh heartily at that
reik; but Iâ€™ll hardly hae the heart to doâ€™t again, since the ill-farâ€™d
accident at the Loch. Na, na--his Excellency kenâ€™d nought oâ€™ that
ploy--it was aâ€™ managed atween Rashleigh and mysell. But the sport that
came after--and Rashleighâ€™s shift oâ€™ turning the suspicion aff himself
upon you, that he had nae grit favour to frae the beginning--and then
Miss Die, she maun hae us sweep up aâ€™ our spidersâ€™ webs again, and set
you out oâ€™ the Justiceâ€™s claws--and then the frightened craven Morris,
that was scared out oâ€™ his seven senses by seeing the real man when he
was charging the innocent stranger--and the gowk of a clerk--and the
drunken carle of a justice--Ohon! ohon!--mony a laugh that jobâ€™s gien
me--and now, aâ€™ that I can do for the puir devil is to get some messes
said for his soul.â€

â€œMay I ask,â€ said I, â€œhow Miss Vernon came to have so much influence over
Rashleigh and his accomplices as to derange your projected plan?â€

â€œMine! it was none of mine. No man can say I ever laid my burden on other
folkâ€™s shoulders--it was aâ€™ Rashleighâ€™s doings. But, undoubtedly, she had
great influence wiâ€™ us baith on account of his Excellencyâ€™s affection, as
weel as that she kenâ€™d far ower mony secrets to be lightlied in a matter
oâ€™ that kind.--Deil tak him,â€ he ejaculated, by way of summing up, â€œthat
gies women either secret to keep or power to abuse--fules shouldna hae
chapping-sticks.â€

We were now within a quarter of a mile from the village, when three
Highlanders, springing upon us with presented arms, commanded us to stand
and tell our business. The single word _Gregaragh,_ in the deep and
commanding voice of my companion, was answered by a shout, or rather
yell, of joyful recognition. One, throwing down his firelock, clasped his
leader so fast round the knees, that he was unable to extricate himself,
muttering, at the same time, a torrent of Gaelic gratulation, which every
now and then rose into a sort of scream of gladness. The two others,
after the first howling was over, set off literally with the speed of
deers, contending which should first carry to the village, which a strong
party of the MacGregors now occupied, the joyful news of Rob Royâ€™s escape
and return. The intelligence excited such shouts of jubilation, that the
very hills rung again, and young and old, men, women, and children,
without distinction of sex or age, came running down the vale to meet us,
with all the tumultuous speed and clamour of a mountain torrent. When I
heard the rushing noise and yells of this joyful multitude approach us, I
thought it a fitting precaution to remind MacGregor that I was a
stranger, and under his protection. He accordingly held me fast by the
hand, while the assemblage crowded around him with such shouts of devoted
attachment, and joy at his return, as were really affecting; nor did he
extend to his followers what all eagerly sought, the grasp, namely, of
his hand, until he had made them understand that I was to be kindly and
carefully used.

The mandate of the Sultan of Delhi could not have been more promptly
obeyed. Indeed, I now sustained nearly as much inconvenience from their
well-meant attentions as formerly from their rudeness. They would hardly
allow the friend of their leader to walk upon his own legs, so earnest
were they in affording me support and assistance upon the way; and at
length, taking advantage of a slight stumble which I made over a stone,
which the press did not permit me to avoid, they fairly seized upon me,
and bore me in their arms in triumph towards Mrs. MacAlpineâ€™s.

On arrival before her hospitable wigwam, I found power and popularity had
its inconveniences in the Highlands, as everywhere else; for, before
MacGregor could be permitted to enter the house where he was to obtain
rest and refreshment, he was obliged to relate the story of his escape at
least a dozen times over, as I was told by an officious old man, who
chose to translate it at least as often for my edification, and to whom I
was in policy obliged to seem to pay a decent degree of attention. The
audience being at length satisfied, group after group departed to take
their bed upon the heath, or in the neighbouring huts, some cursing the
Duke and Garschattachin, some lamenting the probable danger of Ewan of
Brigglands, incurred by his friendship to MacGregor, but all agreeing
that the escape of Rob Roy himself lost nothing in comparison with the
exploit of any one of their chiefs since the days of Dougal Ciar, the
founder of his line.

The friendly outlaw, now taking me by the arm, conducted me into the
interior of the hut. My eyes roved round its smoky recesses in quest of
Diana and her companion; but they were nowhere to be seen, and I felt as
if to make inquiries might betray some secret motives, which were best
concealed. The only known countenance upon which my eyes rested was that
of the Bailie, who, seated on a stool by the fireside, received with a
sort of reserved dignity, the welcomes of Rob Roy, the apologies which he
made for his indifferent accommodation, and his inquiries after his
health.

â€œI am pretty weel, kinsman,â€ said the Bailie--â€œindifferent weel, I thank
ye; and for accommodations, ane canna expect to carry about the Saut
Market at his tail, as a snail does his caup;--and I am blythe that ye
hae gotten out oâ€™ the hands oâ€™ your unfreends.â€

â€œWeel, weel, then,â€ answered Roy, â€œwhat isâ€™t ails ye, man--aâ€™s weel that
ends weel!--the warld will last our day--Come, take a cup oâ€™ brandy--your
father the deacon could take ane at an orra time.â€

â€œIt might be he might do sae, Robin, after fatigue--whilk has been my lot
mair ways than ane this day. But,â€ he continued, slowly filling up a
little wooden stoup which might hold about three glasses, â€œhe was a
moderate man of his bicker, as I am mysell--Hereâ€™s wussing health to ye,
Robinâ€ (a sip), â€œand your weelfare here and hereafterâ€ (another taste),
â€œand also to my cousin Helen--and to your twa hopefuâ€™ lads, of whom mair
anon.â€

So saying, he drank up the contents of the cup with great gravity and
deliberation, while MacGregor winked aside to me, as if in ridicule of
the air of wisdom and superior authority which the Bailie assumed towards
him in their intercourse, and which he exercised when Rob was at the head
of his armed clan, in full as great, or a greater degree, than when he
was at the Bailieâ€™s mercy in the Tolbooth of Glasgow. It seemed to me,
that MacGregor wished me, as a stranger, to understand, that if he
submitted to the tone which his kinsman assumed, it was partly out of
deference to the rights of hospitality, but still more for the jestâ€™s
sake.

As the Bailie set down his cup he recognised me, and giving me a cordial
welcome on my return, he waived farther communication with me for the
present.--â€œI will speak to your matters anon; I maun begin, as in reason,
wiâ€™ those of my kinsman.--I presume, Robin, thereâ€™s naebody here will
carry aught oâ€™ what I am gaun to say, to the town-council or elsewhere,
to my prejudice or to yours?â€

â€œMake yourself easy on that head, cousin Nicol,â€ answered MacGregor; â€œthe
tae half oâ€™ the gillies winna ken what ye say, and the tother winna
care--besides that, I wad stow the tongue out oâ€™ the head oâ€™ any oâ€™ them
that suld presume to say ower again ony speech held wiâ€™ me in their
presence.â€

â€œAweel, cousin, sic being the case, and Mr. Osbaldistone here being a
prudent youth, and a safe friend--Iâ€™se plainly tell ye, ye are breeding
up your family to gang an ill gate.â€ Then, clearing his voice with a
preliminary hem, he addressed his kinsman, checking, as Malvolio proposed
to do when seated in his state, his familiar smile with an austere regard
of control.--â€œYe ken yourself ye haud light by the law--and for my cousin
Helen, forbye that her reception oâ€™ me this blessed day--whilk I excuse
on account of perturbation of mind, was muckle on the north side oâ€™
_friendly,_ I say (outputting this personal reason of complaint) I hae
that to say oâ€™ your wifeâ€--

â€œSay _nothing_ of her, kinsman,â€ said Rob, in a grave and stern tone,
â€œbut what is befitting a friend to say, and her husband to hear. Of me
you are welcome to say your full pleasure.â€

â€œAweel, aweel,â€ said the Bailie, somewhat disconcerted, â€œweâ€™se let that
be a pass-over--I dinna approve of making mischief in families. But here
are your twa sons, Hamish and Robin, whilk signifies, as Iâ€™m gien to
understand, James and Robert--I trust ye will call them sae in
future--there comes nae gude oâ€™ Hamishes, and Eachines, and Angusses,
except that theyâ€™re the names ane aye chances to see in the indictments
at the Western Circuits for cow-lifting, at the instance of his
majestyâ€™s advocate for his majestyâ€™s interest. Aweel, but the twa lads,
as I was saying, they haena sae muckle as the ordinar grunds, man, of
liberal education--they dinna ken the very multiplication table itself,
whilk is the root of aâ€™ usefuâ€™ knowledge, and they did naething but
laugh and fleer at me when I tauld them my mind on their ignorance--Itâ€™s
my belief they can neither read, write, nor cipher, if sic a thing could
be believed oâ€™ aneâ€™s ain connections in a Christian land.â€

â€œIf they could, kinsman,â€ said MacGregor, with great indifference, â€œtheir
learning must have come oâ€™ free will, for whar the deil was I to get them
a teacher?--wad ye hae had me put on the gate oâ€™ your Divinity Hall at
Glasgow College, â€˜Wanted, a tutor for Rob Royâ€™s bairns?â€™â€

â€œNa, kinsman,â€ replied Mr. Jarvie, â€œbut ye might hae sent the lads whar
they could hae learned the fear oâ€™ God, and the usages of civilised
creatures. They are as ignorant as the kyloes ye used to drive to market,
or the very English churls that ye sauld them to, and can do naething
whatever to purpose.â€

â€œUmph!â€ answered Rob; â€œHamish can bring doun a black-cock when heâ€™s on
the wing wiâ€™ a single bullet, and Rob can drive a dirk through a twa-inch
board.â€

â€œSae muckle the waur for them, cousin!--sae muckle the waur for them
baith!â€ answered the Glasgow merchant in a tone of great decision; â€œan
they ken naething better than that, they had better no ken that neither.
Tell me yourself, Rob, what has aâ€™ this cutting, and stabbing, and
shooting, and driving of dirks, whether through human flesh or fir deals,
dune for yourself?--and werena ye a happier man at the tail oâ€™ your
nowte-bestial, when ye were in an honest calling, than ever ye hae been
since, at the head oâ€™ your Hieland kernes and gally-glasses?â€

I observed that MacGregor, while his well-meaning kinsman spoke to him in
this manner, turned and writhed his body like a man who indeed suffers
pain, but is determined no groan shall escape his lips; and I longed for
an opportunity to interrupt the well-meant, but, as it was obvious to me,
quite mistaken strain, in which Jarvie addressed this extraordinary
person. The dialogue, however, came to an end without my interference.

â€œAnd sae,â€ said the Bailie, â€œI hae been thinking, Rob, that as it may be
ye are ower deep in the black book to win a pardon, and ower auld to mend
yourself, that it wad be a pity to bring up twa hopefuâ€™ lads to sic a
godless trade as your ain, and I wad blythely tak them for prentices at
the loom, as I began mysell, and my father the deacon afore me, though,
praise to the Giver, I only trade now as wholesale dealer--And--andâ€--

He saw a storm gathering on Robâ€™s brow, which probably induced him to
throw in, as a sweetener of an obnoxious proposition, what he had
reserved to crown his own generosity, had it been embraced as an
acceptable one;--â€œand Robin, lad, ye needna look sae glum, for Iâ€™ll pay
the prentice-fee, and never plague ye for the thousand merks neither.â€

â€œ_Ceade millia diaoul,_ hundred thousand devils!â€ exclaimed Rob,
rising and striding through the hut, â€œMy sons weavers!--_Millia
molligheart!_--but I wad see every loom in Glasgow, beam, traddles,
and shuttles, burnt in hell-fire sooner!â€

With some difficulty I made the Bailie, who was preparing a reply,
comprehend the risk and impropriety of pressing our host on this topic,
and in a minute he recovered, or reassumed, his serenity of temper.

â€œBut ye mean weel--ye mean weel,â€ said he; â€œso gie me your hand, Nicol,
and if ever I put my sons apprentice, I will gie you the refusal oâ€™ them.
And, as you say, thereâ€™s the thousand merks to be settled between us.--
Here, Eachin MacAnaleister, bring me my sporran.â€

The person he addressed, a tall, strong mountaineer, who seemed to act as
MacGregorâ€™s lieutenant, brought from some place of safety a large
leathern pouch, such as Highlanders of rank wear before them when in full
dress, made of the skin of the sea-otter, richly garnished with silver
ornaments and studs.

â€œI advise no man to attempt opening this sporran till he has my secret,â€
 said Rob Roy; and then twisting one button in one direction, and another
in another, pulling one stud upward, and pressing another downward, the
mouth of the purse, which was bound with massive silver plate, opened and
gave admittance to his hand. He made me remark, as if to break short the
subject on which Bailie Jarvie had spoken, that a small steel pistol was
concealed within the purse, the trigger of which was connected with the
mounting, and made part of the machinery, so that the weapon would
certainly be discharged, and in all probability its contents lodged in
the person of any one, who, being unacquainted with the secret, should
tamper with the lock which secured his treasure. â€œThis,â€ said he touching
the pistol--â€œthis is the keeper of my privy purse.â€

The simplicity of the contrivance to secure a furred pouch, which could
have been ripped open without any attempt on the spring, reminded me of
the verses in the Odyssey, where Ulysses, in a yet ruder age, is content
to secure his property by casting a curious and involved complication of
cordage around the sea-chest in which it was deposited.

The Bailie put on his spectacles to examine the mechanism, and when he
had done, returned it with a smile and a sigh, observing--â€œAh! Rob, had
ither folkâ€™s purses been as weel guarded, I doubt if your sporran wad hae
been as weel filled as it kythes to be by the weight.â€

â€œNever mind, kinsman,â€ said Rob, laughing; â€œit will aye open for a
friendâ€™s necessity, or to pay a just due--and here,â€ he added, pulling
out a rouleau of gold, â€œhere is your ten hundred merks--count them, and
see that you are full and justly paid.â€

Mr. Jarvie took the money in silence, and weighing it in his hand for an
instant, laid it on the table, and replied, â€œRob, I canna tak it--I downa
intromit with it--there can nae gude come oâ€™t--I hae seen ower weel the
day what sort of a gate your gowd is made in--ill-got gear neâ€™er
prospered; and, to be plain wiâ€™ you, I winna meddle wiâ€™t--it looks as
there might be bluid onâ€™t.â€

â€œTroutsho!â€ said the outlaw, affecting an indifference which perhaps he
did not altogether feel; â€œitâ€™s gude French gowd, and neâ€™er was in
Scotchmanâ€™s pouch before mine. Look at them, man--they are aâ€™
louis-dâ€™ors, bright and bonnie as the day they were coined.â€

â€œThe waur, the waur--just sae muckle the waur, Robin,â€ replied the
Bailie, averting his eyes from the money, though, like Caesar on the
Lupercal, his fingers seemed to itch for it--â€œRebellion is waur than
witchcraft, or robbery either; thereâ€™s gospel warrant forâ€™t.â€

â€œNever mind the warrant, kinsman,â€ said the freebooter; â€œyou come by the
gowd honestly, and in payment of a just debt--it came from the one king,
you may gie it to the other, if ye like; and it will just serve for a
weakening of the enemy, and in the point where puir King James is weakest
too, for, God knows, he has hands and hearts eneugh, but I doubt he wants
the siller.â€

â€œHeâ€™ll no get mony Hielanders then, Robin,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, as, again
replacing his spectacles on his nose, he undid the rouleau, and began to
count its contents.

â€œNor Lowlanders neither,â€ said MacGregor, arching his eyebrow, and, as he
looked at me, directing a glance towards Mr. Jarvie, who, all unconscious
of the ridicule, weighed each piece with habitual scrupulosity; and
having told twice over the sum, which amounted to the discharge of his
debt, principal and interest, he returned three pieces to buy his
kinswoman a gown, as he expressed himself, and a brace more for the twa
bairns, as he called them, requesting they might buy anything they liked
with them except gunpowder. The Highlander stared at his kinsmanâ€™s
unexpected generosity, but courteously accepted his gift, which he
deposited for the time in his well-secured pouch.

The Bailie next produced the original bond for the debt, on the back of
which he had written a formal discharge, which, having subscribed
himself, he requested me to sign as a witness. I did so, and Bailie
Jarvie was looking anxiously around for another, the Scottish law
requiring the subscription of two witnesses to validate either a bond or
acquittance. â€œYou will hardly find a man that can write save ourselves
within these three miles,â€ said Rob, â€œbut Iâ€™ll settle the matter as
easily;â€ and, taking the paper from before his kinsman, he threw it in
the fire. Bailie Jarvie stared in his turn, but his kinsman continued,
â€œThatâ€™s a Hieland settlement of accounts. The time might come, cousin,
were I to keep aâ€™ these charges and discharges, that friends might be
brought into trouble for having dealt with me.â€

The Bailie attempted no reply to this argument, and our supper now
appeared in a style of abundance, and even delicacy, which, for the
place, might be considered as extraordinary. The greater part of the
provisions were cold, intimating they had been prepared at some distance;
and there were some bottles of good French wine to relish pasties of
various sorts of game, as well as other dishes. I remarked that
MacGregor, while doing the honours of the table with great and anxious
hospitality, prayed us to excuse the circumstance that some particular
dish or pasty had been infringed on before it was presented to us. â€œYou
must know,â€ said he to Mr. Jarvie, but without looking towards me, â€œyou
are not the only guests this night in the MacGregorâ€™s country, whilk,
doubtless, ye will believe, since my wife and the twa lads would
otherwise have been maist ready to attend you, as weel beseems them.â€

Bailie Jarvie looked as if he felt glad at any circumstance which
occasioned their absence; and I should have been entirely of his opinion,
had it not been that the outlawâ€™s apology seemed to imply they were in
attendance on Diana and her companion, whom even in my thoughts I could
not bear to designate as her husband.

While the unpleasant ideas arising from this suggestion counteracted the
good effects of appetite, welcome, and good cheer, I remarked that Rob
Royâ€™s attention had extended itself to providing us better bedding than
we had enjoyed the night before. Two of the least fragile of the
bedsteads, which stood by the wall of the hut, had been stuffed with
heath, then in full flower, so artificially arranged, that, the flowers
being uppermost, afforded a mattress at once elastic and fragrant.
Cloaks, and such bedding as could be collected, stretched over this
vegetable couch, made it both soft and warm. The Bailie seemed exhausted
by fatigue. I resolved to adjourn my communication to him until next
morning; and therefore suffered him to betake himself to bed so soon as
he had finished a plentiful supper. Though tired and harassed, I did not
myself feel the same disposition to sleep, but rather a restless and
feverish anxiety, which led to some farther discourse betwixt me and
MacGregor.





CHAPTER EIGHTEENTH.

               A hopeless darkness settles oâ€™er my fate;
               Iâ€™ve seen the last look of her heavenly eyes,--
               Iâ€™ve heard the last sound of her blessed voice,--
               Iâ€™ve seen her fair form from my sight depart;
                          My doom is closed.
                                        Count Basil.

â€œI ken not what to make of you, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ said MacGregor, as he
pushed the flask towards me. â€œYou eat not, you show no wish for rest; and
yet you drink not, though that flask of Bourdeaux might have come out of
Sir Hildebrandâ€™s ain cellar. Had you been always as abstinent, you would
have escaped the deadly hatred of your cousin Rashleigh.â€

â€œHad I been always prudent,â€ said I, blushing at the scene he recalled to
my recollection, â€œI should have escaped a worse evil--the reproach of my
own conscience.â€

MacGregor cast a keen and somewhat fierce glance on me, as if to read
whether the reproof, which he evidently felt, had been intentionally
conveyed. He saw that I was thinking of myself, not of him, and turned
his face towards the fire with a deep sigh. I followed his example, and
each remained for a few minutes wrapt in his own painful reverie. All in
the hut were now asleep, or at least silent, excepting ourselves.

MacGregor first broke silence, in the tone of one who takes up his
determination to enter on a painful subject. â€œMy cousin Nicol Jarvie
means well,â€ he said, â€œbut he presses ower hard on the temper and
situation of a man like me, considering what I have been--what I have
been forced to become--and, above all, that which has forced me to become
what I am.â€

He paused; and, though feeling the delicate nature of the discussion in
which the conversation was likely to engage me, I could not help
replying, that I did not doubt his present situation had much which must
be most unpleasant to his feelings.

â€œI should be happy to learn,â€ I added, â€œthat there is an honourable
chance of your escaping from it.â€

â€œYou speak like a boy,â€ returned MacGregor, in a low tone that growled
like distant thunder--â€œlike a boy, who thinks the auld gnarled oak can be
twisted as easily as the young sapling. Can I forget that I have been
branded as an outlaw--stigmatised as a traitor--a price set on my head as
if I had been a wolf--my family treated as the dam and cubs of the
hill-fox, whom all may torment, vilify, degrade, and insult--the very
name which came to me from a long and noble line of martial ancestors,
denounced, as if it were a spell to conjure up the devil with?â€

As he went on in this manner, I could plainly see, that, by the
enumeration of his wrongs, he was lashing himself up into a rage, in
order to justify in his own eyes the errors they had led him into. In
this he perfectly succeeded; his light grey eyes contracting alternately
and dilating their pupils, until they seemed actually to flash with
flame, while he thrust forward and drew back his foot, grasped the hilt
of his dirk, extended his arm, clenched his fist, and finally rose from
his seat.

â€œAnd they _shall_ find,â€ he said, in the same muttered but deep tone of
stifled passion, â€œthat the name they have dared to proscribe--that the
name of MacGregor--_is_ a spell to raise the wild devil withal. _They_
shall hear of my vengeance, that would scorn to listen to the story of my
wrongs--The miserable Highland drover, bankrupt, barefooted,--stripped of
all, dishonoured and hunted down, because the avarice of others grasped
at more than that poor all could pay, shall burst on them in an awful
change. They that scoffed at the grovelling worm, and trode upon him, may
cry and howl when they see the stoop of the flying and fiery-mouthed
dragon.--But why do I speak of all this?â€ he said, sitting down again,
and in a calmer tone--â€œOnly ye may opine it frets my patience, Mr.
Osbaldistone, to be hunted like an otter, or a sealgh, or a salmon upon
the shallows, and that by my very friends and neighbours; and to have as
many sword-cuts made, and pistols flashed at me, as I had this day in the
ford of Avondow, would try a saintâ€™s temper, much more a Highlanderâ€™s,
who are not famous for that gude gift, as ye may hae heard, Mr.
Osbaldistone.--But as thing bides wiâ€™ me oâ€™ what Nicol said;--Iâ€™m vexed
for the bairns--Iâ€™m vexed when I think oâ€™ Hamish and Robert living their
fatherâ€™s life.â€ And yielding to despondence on account of his sons, which
he felt not upon his own, the father rested his head upon his hand.

I was much affected, Will. All my life long I have been more melted by
the distress under which a strong, proud, and powerful mind is compelled
to give way, than by the more easily excited sorrows of softer
dispositions. The desire of aiding him rushed strongly on my mind,
notwithstanding the apparent difficulty, and even impossibility, of the
task.

â€œWe have extensive connections abroad,â€ said I: â€œmight not your sons,
with some assistance--and they are well entitled to what my fatherâ€™s
house can give--find an honourable resource in foreign service?â€

I believe my countenance showed signs of sincere emotion; but my
companion, taking me by the hand, as I was going to speak farther,
said--â€œI thank--I thank ye--but let us say nae mair oâ€™ this. I did not
think the eye of man would again have seen a tear on MacGregorâ€™s
eye-lash.â€ He dashed the moisture from his long gray eye-lash and shaggy
red eye-brow with the back of his hand. â€œTo-morrow morning,â€ he said,
â€œweâ€™ll talk of this, and we will talk, too, of your affairs--for we are
early starters in the dawn, even when we have the luck to have good beds
to sleep in. Will ye not pledge me in a grace cup?â€ I declined the
invitation.

â€œThen, by the soul of St. Maronoch! I must pledge myself,â€ and he poured
out and swallowed at least half-a-quart of wine.

I laid myself down to repose, resolving to delay my own inquiries until
his mind should be in a more composed state. Indeed, so much had this
singular man possessed himself of my imagination, that I felt it
impossible to avoid watching him for some minutes after I had flung
myself on my heath mattress to seeming rest. He walked up and down the
hut, crossed himself from time to time, muttering over some Latin prayer
of the Catholic church; then wrapped himself in his plaid, with his naked
sword on one side, and his pistol on the other, so disposing the folds of
his mantle that he could start up at a momentâ€™s warning, with a weapon in
either hand, ready for instant combat. In a few minutes his heavy
breathing announced that he was fast asleep. Overpowered by fatigue, and
stunned by the various unexpected and extraordinary scenes of the day, I,
in my turn, was soon overpowered by a slumber deep and overwhelming, from
which, notwithstanding every cause for watchfulness, I did not awake
until the next morning.

When I opened my eyes, and recollected my situation, I found that
MacGregor had already left the hut. I awakened the Bailie, who, after
many a snort and groan, and some heavy complaints of the soreness of his
bones, in consequence of the unwonted exertions of the preceding day, was
at length able to comprehend the joyful intelligence, that the assets
carried off by Rashleigh Osbaldistone had been safely recovered. The
instant he understood my meaning, he forgot all his grievances, and,
bustling up in a great hurry, proceeded to compare the contents of the
packet which I put into his hands, with Mr. Owenâ€™s memorandums,
muttering, as he went on, â€œRight, right--the real thing--Bailie and
Whittington--whereâ€™s Bailie and Whittington?--seven hundred, six, and
eight--exact to a fraction--Pollock and Peelman--twenty-eight,
seven--exact--Praise be blest!--Grub and Grinder--better men cannot
be--three hundred and seventy--Gliblad--twenty; I doubt Glibladâ€™s
ganging--Slipprytongue; Slipprytongueâ€™s gaen--but they are
smaâ€™sums--smaâ€™sums--the restâ€™s aâ€™right--Praise be blest! we have got the
stuff, and may leave this doleful country. I shall never think on
Loch-Ard but the thought will gar me grew again.â€

â€œI am sorry, cousin,â€ said MacGregor, who entered the hut during the last
observation, â€œI have not been altogether in the circumstances to make
your reception sic as I could have desired--natheless, if you would
condescend to visit my puir dwellingâ€--

â€œMuckle obliged, muckle obliged,â€ answered Mr. Jarvie, very hastily--â€œBut
we maun be ganging--we maun be jogging, Mr. Osbaldistone and me--business
canna wait.â€

â€œAweel, kinsman,â€ replied the Highlander, â€œye ken our fashion--foster the
guest that comes--further him that maun gang. But ye cannot return by
Drymen--I must set you on Loch Lomond, and boat ye down to the Ferry oâ€™
Balloch, and send your nags round to meet ye there. Itâ€™s a maxim of a
wise man never to return by the same road he came, providing anotherâ€™s
free to him.â€

â€œAy, ay, Rob,â€ said the Bailie, â€œthatâ€™s ane oâ€™ the maxims ye learned when
ye were a drover;--ye caredna to face the tenants where your beasts had
been taking a rug of their moorland grass in the by-ganging, and I doubt
your roadâ€™s waur marked now than it was then.â€

â€œThe mair need not to travel it ower often, kinsman,â€ replied Rob; â€œbut
Iâ€™se send round your nags to the ferry wiâ€™ Dougal Gregor, wha is
converted for that purpose into the Bailieâ€™s man, coming--not, as ye may
believe, from Aberfoil or Rob Royâ€™s country, but on a quiet jaunt from
Stirling. See, here he is.â€

â€œI wadna hae kenâ€™d the creature,â€ said Mr. Jarvie; nor indeed was it easy
to recognise the wild Highlander, when he appeared before the door of the
cottage, attired in a hat, periwig, and riding-coat, which had once
called Andrew Fairservice master, and mounted on the Bailieâ€™s horse, and
leading mine. He received his last orders from his master to avoid
certain places where he might be exposed to suspicion--to collect what
intelligence he could in the course of his journey, and to await our
coming at an appointed place, near the Ferry of Balloch.

At the same time, MacGregor invited us to accompany him upon our own
road, assuring us that we must necessarily march a few miles before
breakfast, and recommending a dram of brandy as a proper introduction to
the journey, in which he was pledged by the Bailie, who pronounced it â€œan
unlawful and perilous habit to begin the day wiâ€™ spirituous liquors,
except to defend the stomach (whilk was a tender part) against the
morning mist; in whilk case his father the deacon had recommended a dram,
by precept and example.â€

â€œVery true, kinsman,â€ replied Rob, â€œfor which reason we, who are Children
of the Mist, have a right to drink brandy from morning till night.â€

The Bailie, thus refreshed, was mounted on a small Highland pony; another
was offered for my use, which, however, I declined; and we resumed, under
very different guidance and auspices, our journey of the preceding day.

Our escort consisted of MacGregor, and five or six of the handsomest,
best armed, and most athletic mountaineers of his band, and whom he had
generally in immediate attendance upon his own person.

When we approached the pass, the scene of the skirmish of the preceding
day, and of the still more direful deed which followed it, MacGregor
hastened to speak, as if it were rather to what he knew must be
necessarily passing in my mind, than to any thing I had said--he spoke,
in short, to my thoughts, and not to my words.

â€œYou must think hardly of us, Mr. Osbaldistone, and it is not natural
that it should be otherwise. But remember, at least, we have not been
unprovoked. We are a rude and an ignorant, and it may be a violent and
passionate, but we are not a cruel people. The land might be at peace and
in law for us, did they allow us to enjoy the blessings of peaceful law.
But we have been a persecuted generation.â€

â€œAnd persecution,â€ said the Bailie, â€œmaketh wise men mad.â€

â€œWhat must it do then to men like us, living as our fathers did a
thousand years since, and possessing scarce more lights than they did?
Can we view their bluidy edicts against us--their hanging, heading,
hounding, and hunting down an ancient and honourable name--as deserving
better treatment than that which enemies give to enemies?--Here I stand,
have been in twenty frays, and never hurt man but when I was in het
bluid; and yet they wad betray me and hang me like a masterless dog, at
the gate of ony great man that has an ill will at me.â€

I replied, â€œthat the proscription of his name and family sounded in
English ears as a very cruel and arbitrary law;â€ and having thus far
soothed him, I resumed my propositions of obtaining military employment
for himself, if he chose it, and his sons, in foreign parts. MacGregor
shook me very cordially by the hand, and detaining me, so as to permit
Mr. Jarvie to precede us, a manoeuvre for which the narrowness of the
road served as an excuse, he said to me--â€œYou are a kind-hearted and an
honourable youth, and understand, doubtless, that which is due to the
feelings of a man of honour. But the heather that I have trode upon when
living, must bloom ower me when I am dead--my heart would sink, and my
arm would shrink and wither like fern in the frost, were I to lose sight
of my native hills; nor has the world a scene that would console me for
the loss of the rocks and cairns, wild as they are, that you see around
us.--And Helen--what could become of her, were I to leave her the subject
of new insult and atrocity?--or how could she bear to be removed from
these scenes, where the remembrance of her wrongs is aye sweetened by the
recollection of her revenge?--I was once so hard put at by my Great
enemy, as I may well caâ€™ him, that I was forced eâ€™en to gie way to the
tide, and removed myself and my people and family from our dwellings in
our native land, and to withdraw for a time into MacCallum Moreâ€™s
country--and Helen made a Lament on our departure, as weel as MacRimmon
himsell could hae framed it--and so piteously sad and waesome, that our
hearts amaist broke as we sate and listened to her--it was like the
wailing of one that mourns for the mother that bore him--the tears came
down the rough faces of our gillies as they hearkened; and I wad not have
the same touch of heartbreak again, no, not to have all the lands that
ever were owned by MacGregor.â€

â€œBut your sons,â€ I said--â€œthey are at the age when your countrymen have
usually no objection to see the world?â€

â€œAnd I should be content,â€ he replied, â€œthat they pushed their fortune in
the French or Spanish service, as is the wont of Scottish cavaliers of
honour; and last night your plan seemed feasible eneugh--But I hae seen
his Excellency this morning before ye were up.â€

â€œDid he then quarter so near us?â€ said I, my bosom throbbing with
anxiety.

â€œNearer than ye thought,â€ was MacGregorâ€™s reply; â€œbut he seemed rather in
some shape to jalouse your speaking to the young leddy; and so you seeâ€--

â€œThere was no occasion for jealousy,â€ I answered, with some haughtiness;
--â€œI should not have intruded on his privacy.â€

â€œBut ye must not be offended, or look out from amang your curls then,
like a wildcat out of an ivy-tod, for ye are to understand that he wishes
most sincere weel to you, and has proved it. And itâ€™s partly that whilk
has set the heather on fire eâ€™en now.â€

â€œHeather on fire?â€ said I. â€œI do not understand you.â€

â€œWhy,â€ resumed MacGregor, â€œye ken weel eneugh that women and gear are at
the bottom of aâ€™ the mischief in this warld. I hae been misdoubting your
cousin Rashleigh since ever he saw that he wasna to get Die Vernon for
his marrow, and I think he took grudge at his Excellency mainly on that
account. But then came the splore about the surrendering your papers--and
we hae now gude evidence, that, sae soon as he was compelled to yield
them up, he rade post to Stirling, and tauld the Government all and mair
than all, that was gaun doucely on amang us hill-folk; and, doubtless,
that was the way that the country was laid to take his Excellency and the
leddy, and to make sic an unexpected raid on me. And I hae as little
doubt that the poor deevil Morris, whom he could gar believe onything,
was egged on by him, and some of the Lowland gentry, to trepan me in the
gate he tried to do. But if Rashleigh Osbaldistone were baith the last
and best of his name, and granting that he and I ever forgather again,
the fiend go down my weasand with a bare blade at his belt, if we part
before my dirk and his best blude are weel acquainted thegither!â€

He pronounced the last threat with an ominous frown, and the appropriate
gesture of his hand upon his dagger.

â€œI should almost rejoice at what has happened,â€ said I, â€œcould I hope
that Rashleighâ€™s treachery might prove the means of preventing the
explosion of the rash and desperate intrigues in which I have long
suspected him to be a prime agent.â€

â€œTrow ye na that,â€ said Rob Roy; â€œtraitorâ€™s word never yet hurt honest
cause. He was ower deep in our secrets, thatâ€™s true; and had it not been
so, Stirling and Edinburgh Castles would have been baith in our hands by
this time, or briefly hereafter, whilk is now scarce to be hoped for. But
there are ower mony engaged, and far ower gude a cause to be gien up for
the breath of a traitorâ€™s tale, and that will be seen and heard of ere it
be lang. And so, as I was about to say, the best of my thanks to you for
your offer anent my sons, whilk last night I had some thoughts to have
embraced in their behalf. But I see that this villainâ€™s treason will
convince our great folks that they must instantly draw to a head, and
make a blow for it, or be taen in their houses, coupled up like hounds,
and driven up to London like the honest noblemen and gentlemen in the
year seventeen hundred and seven. Civil war is like a cockatrice;--we
have sitten hatching the egg that held it for ten years, and might hae
sitten on for ten years mair, when in comes Rashleigh, and chips the
shell, and out bangs the wonder amang us, and cries to fire and sword.
Now in sic a matter Iâ€™ll hae need oâ€™ aâ€™ the hands I can mak; and, nae
disparagement to the Kings of France and Spain, whom I wish very weel to,
King James is as gude a man as ony oâ€™ them, and has the best right to
Hamish and Rob, being his natural-born subjects.â€

I easily comprehended that these words boded a general national
convulsion; and, as it would have been alike useless and dangerous to
have combated the political opinions of my guide, at such a place and
moment, I contented myself with regretting the promiscuous scene of
confusion and distress likely to arise from any general exertion in
favour of the exiled royal family.

â€œLet it come, man--let it come,â€ answered MacGregor; â€œye never saw dull
weather clear without a shower; and if the world is turned upside down,
why, honest men have the better chance to cut bread out of it.â€

I again attempted to bring him back to the subject of Diana; but although
on most occasions and subjects he used a freedom of speech which I had no
great delight in listening to, yet upon that alone which was most
interesting to me, he kept a degree of scrupulous reserve, and contented
himself with intimating, â€œthat he hoped the leddy would be soon in a
quieter country than this was like to be for one while.â€ I was obliged to
be content with this answer, and to proceed in the hope that accident
might, as on a former occasion, stand my friend, and allow me at least
the sad gratification of bidding farewell to the object which had
occupied such a share of my affections, so much beyond even what I had
supposed, till I was about to be separated from her for ever.

We pursued the margin of the lake for about six English miles, through a
devious and beautifully variegated path, until we attained a sort of
Highland farm, or assembly of hamlets, near the head of that fine sheet
of water, called, if I mistake not, Lediart, or some such name. Here a
numerous party of MacGregorâ€™s men were stationed in order to receive us.
The taste as well as the eloquence of tribes in a savage, or, to speak
more properly, in a rude state, is usually just, because it is unfettered
by system and affectation; and of this I had an example in the choice
these mountaineers had made of a place to receive their guests. It has
been said that a British monarch would judge well to receive the embassy
of a rival power in the cabin of a man-of-war; and a Highland leader
acted with some propriety in choosing a situation where the natural
objects of grandeur proper to his country might have their full effect on
the minds of his guests.

We ascended about two hundred yards from the shores of the lake, guided
by a brawling brook, and left on the right hand four or five Highland
huts, with patches of arable land around them, so small as to show that
they must have been worked with the spade rather than the plough, cut as
it were out of the surrounding copsewood, and waving with crops of barley
and oats. Above this limited space the hill became more steep; and on its
edge we descried the glittering arms and waving drapery of about fifty of
MacGregorâ€™s followers. They were stationed on a spot, the recollection of
which yet strikes me with admiration. The brook, hurling its waters
downwards from the mountain, had in this spot encountered a barrier rock,
over which it had made its way by two distinct leaps. The first fall,
across which a magnificent old oak, slanting out from the farther bank,
partly extended itself as if to shroud the dusky stream of the cascade,
might be about twelve feet high; the broken waters were received in a
beautiful stone basin, almost as regular as if hewn by a sculptor; and
after wheeling around its flinty margin, they made a second precipitous
dash, through a dark and narrow chasm, at least fifty feet in depth, and
from thence, in a hurried, but comparatively a more gentle course,
escaped to join the lake.

With the natural taste which belongs to mountaineers, and especially to
the Scottish Highlanders, whose feelings, I have observed, are often
allied with the romantic and poetical, Rob Royâ€™s wife and followers had
prepared our morning repast in a scene well calculated to impress
strangers with some feelings of awe. They are also naturally a grave and
proud people, and, however rude in our estimation, carry their ideas of
form and politeness to an excess that would appear overstrained, except
from the demonstration of superior force which accompanies the display of
it; for it must be granted that the air of punctilious deference and
rigid etiquette which would seem ridiculous in an ordinary peasant, has,
like the salute of a _corps-de-garde,_ a propriety when tendered by a
Highlander completely armed. There was, accordingly, a good deal of
formality in our approach and reception.

The Highlanders, who had been dispersed on the side of the hill, drew
themselves together when we came in view, and, standing firm and
motionless, appeared in close column behind three figures, whom I soon
recognised to be Helen MacGregor and her two sons. MacGregor himself
arranged his attendants in the rear, and, requesting Mr. Jarvie to
dismount where the ascent became steep, advanced slowly, marshalling us
forward at the head of the troop. As we advanced, we heard the wild notes
of the bagpipes, which lost their natural discord from being mingled with
the dashing sound of the cascade. When we came close, the wife of
MacGregor came forward to meet us. Her dress was studiously arranged in a
more feminine taste than it had been on the preceding day, but her
features wore the same lofty, unbending, and resolute character; and as
she folded my friend the Bailie in an unexpected and apparently unwelcome
embrace, I could perceive by the agitation of his wig, his back, and the
calves of his legs, that he felt much like to one who feels himself
suddenly in the gripe of a she-bear, without being able to distinguish
whether the animal is in kindness or in wrath.

â€œKinsman,â€ she said, â€œyou are welcome--and you, too, stranger,â€ she
added, releasing my alarmed companion, who instinctively drew back and
settled his wig, and addressing herself to me--â€œyou also are welcome. You
came,â€ she added, â€œto our unhappy country, when our bloods were chafed,
and our hands were red. Excuse the rudeness that gave you a rough
welcome, and lay it upon the evil times, and not upon us.â€ All this was
said with the manners of a princess, and in the tone and style of a
court. Nor was there the least tincture of that vulgarity, which we
naturally attach to the Lowland Scottish. There was a strong provincial
accentuation, but, otherwise, the language rendered by Helen MacGregor,
out of the native and poetical Gaelic, into English, which she had
acquired as we do learned tongues, but had probably never heard applied
to the mean purposes of ordinary life, was graceful, flowing, and
declamatory. Her husband, who had in his time played many parts, used a
much less elevated and emphatic dialect;--but even _his_ language rose in
purity of expression, as you may have remarked, if I have been accurate
in recording it, when the affairs which he discussed were of an agitating
and important nature; and it appears to me in his case, and in that of
some other Highlanders whom I have known, that, when familiar and
facetious, they used the Lowland Scottish dialect,--when serious and
impassioned, their thoughts arranged themselves in the idiom of their
native language; and in the latter case, as they uttered the
corresponding ideas in English, the expressions sounded wild, elevated,
and poetical. In fact, the language of passion is almost always pure as
well as vehement, and it is no uncommon thing to hear a Scotchman, when
overwhelmed by a countryman with a tone of bitter and fluent upbraiding,
reply by way of taunt to his adversary, â€œYou have gotten to your
English.â€

Be this as it may, the wife of MacGregor invited us to a refreshment
spread out on the grass, which abounded with all the good things their
mountains could offer, but was clouded by the dark and undisturbed
gravity which sat on the brow of our hostess, as well as by our deep and
anxious recollection of what had taken place on the preceding day. It was
in vain that the leader exerted himself to excite mirth;--a chill hung
over our minds, as if the feast had been funereal; and every bosom felt
light when it was ended.

â€œAdieu, cousin,â€ she said to Mr. Jarvie, as we rose from the
entertainment; â€œthe best wish Helen MacGregor can give to a friend is,
that he may see her no more.â€

The Bailie struggled to answer, probably with some commonplace maxim of
morality;--but the calm and melancholy sternness of her countenance bore
down and disconcerted the mechanical and formal importance of the
magistrate. He coughed,--hemmed,--bowed,--and was silent.

â€œFor you, stranger,â€ she said, â€œI have a token, from one whom you can
neverâ€--

â€œHelen!â€ interrupted MacGregor, in a loud and stern voice, â€œwhat means
this?--have you forgotten the charge?â€

â€œMacGregor,â€ she replied, â€œI have forgotten nought that is fitting for me
to remember. It is not such hands as these,â€ and she stretched forth her
long, sinewy, and bare arm, â€œthat are fitting to convey love-tokens, were
the gift connected with aught but misery. Young man,â€ she said,
presenting me with a ring, which I well remembered as one of the few
ornaments that Miss Vernon sometimes wore, â€œthis comes from one whom you
will never see more. If it is a joyless token, it is well fitted to pass
through the hands of one to whom joy can never be known. Her last words
were--Let him forget me for ever.â€

â€œAnd can she,â€ I said, almost without being conscious that I spoke,
â€œsuppose that is possible?â€

â€œAll may be forgotten,â€ said the extraordinary female who addressed
me,--â€œall--but the sense of dishonour, and the desire of vengeance.â€

â€œ_Seid suas!_â€œ cried the MacGregor, stamping with impatience.

The bagpipes sounded, and with their thrilling and jarring tones cut
short our conference. Our leave of our hostess was taken by silent
gestures; and we resumed our journey with an additional proof on my part,
that I was beloved by Diana, and was separated from her for ever.





CHAPTER NINETEENTH.

            Farewell to the land where the clouds love to rest,
            Like the shroud of the dead, on the mountainâ€™s cold breast
            To the cataractâ€™s roar where the eagles reply,
            And the lake her lone bosom expands to the sky.

Our route lay through a dreary, yet romantic country, which the distress
of my own mind prevented me from remarking particularly, and which,
therefore, I will not attempt to describe. The lofty peak of Ben Lomond,
here the predominant monarch of the mountains, lay on our right hand, and
served as a striking landmark. I was not awakened from my apathy, until,
after a long and toilsome walk, we emerged through a pass in the hills,
and Loch Lomond opened before us. I will spare you the attempt to
describe what you would hardly comprehend without going to see it. But
certainly this noble lake, boasting innumerable beautiful islands, of
every varying form and outline which fancy can frame,--its northern
extremity narrowing until it is lost among dusky and retreating
mountains,--while, gradually widening as it extends to the southward, it
spreads its base around the indentures and promontories of a fair and
fertile land, affords one of the most surprising, beautiful, and sublime
spectacles in nature. The eastern side, peculiarly rough and rugged, was
at this time the chief seat of MacGregor and his clan,--to curb whom, a
small garrison had been stationed in a central position betwixt Loch
Lomond and another lake. The extreme strength of the country, however,
with the numerous passes, marshes, caverns, and other places of
concealment or defence, made the establishment of this little fort seem
rather an acknowledgment of the danger, than an effectual means of
securing against it.

On more than one occasion, as well as on that which I witnessed, the
garrison suffered from the adventurous spirit of the outlaw and his
followers. These advantages were never sullied by ferocity when he
himself was in command; for, equally good-tempered and sagacious, he
understood well the danger of incurring unnecessary odium. I learned with
pleasure that he had caused the captives of the preceding day to be
liberated in safety; and many traits of mercy, and even of generosity,
are recorded of this remarkable man on similar occasions.

A boat waited for us in a creek beneath a huge rock, manned by four lusty
Highland rowers; and our host took leave of us with great cordiality, and
even affection. Betwixt him and Mr. Jarvie, indeed, there seemed to exist
a degree of mutual regard, which formed a strong contrast to their
different occupations and habits. After kissing each other very lovingly,
and when they were just in the act of parting, the Bailie, in the fulness
of his heart, and with a faltering voice, assured his kinsman, â€œthat if
ever an hundred pund, or even twa hundred, would put him or his family in
a settled way, he need but just send a line to the Saut-Market;â€ and Rob,
grasping his basket-hilt with one hand, and shaking Mr. Jarvieâ€™s heartily
with the other, protested, â€œthat if ever anybody should affront his
kinsman, an he would but let him ken, he would stow his lugs out of his
head, were he the best man in Glasgow.â€

With these assurances of mutual aid and continued good-will, we bore away
from the shore, and took our course for the south-western angle of the
lake, where it gives birth to the river Leven. Rob Roy remained for some
time standing on the rock from beneath which we had departed, conspicuous
by his long gun, waving tartans, and the single plume in his cap, which
in those days denoted the Highland gentleman and soldier; although I
observe that the present military taste has decorated the Highland bonnet
with a quantity of black plumage resembling that which is borne before
funerals. At length, as the distance increased between us, we saw him
turn and go slowly up the side of the hill, followed by his immediate
attendants or bodyguard.

We performed our voyage for a long time in silence, interrupted only by
the Gaelic chant which one of the rowers sung in low irregular measure,
rising occasionally into a wild chorus, in which the others joined.

My own thoughts were sad enough;--yet I felt something soothing in the
magnificent scenery with which I was surrounded; and thought, in the
enthusiasm of the moment, that had my faith been that of Rome, I could
have consented to live and die a lonely hermit in one of the romantic and
beautiful islands amongst which our boat glided.

The Bailie had also his speculations, but they were of somewhat a
different complexion; as I found when, after about an hourâ€™s silence,
during which he had been mentally engaged in the calculations necessary,
he undertook to prove the possibility of draining the lake, and â€œgiving
to plough and harrow many hundred, ay, many a thousand acres, from whilk
no man could get earthly gude eâ€™enow, unless it were a gedd, or a dish
of perch now and then.â€

Amidst a long discussion, which he â€œcrammed into mine ear against the
stomach of my sense,â€ I only remember, that it was part of his project to
preserve a portion of the lake just deep enough and broad enough for the
purposes of water-carriage, so that coal-barges and gabbards should pass
as easily between Dumbarton and Glenfalloch as between Glasgow and
Greenock.

At length we neared our distant place of landing, adjoining to the ruins
of an ancient castle, and just where the lake discharges its superfluous
waters into the Leven. There we found Dougal with the horses. The Bailie
had formed a plan with respect to â€œthe creature,â€ as well as upon the
draining of the lake; and, perhaps in both cases, with more regard to the
utility than to the practical possibility of his scheme. â€œDougal,â€ he
said, â€œye are a kindly creature, and hae the sense and feeling oâ€™ what is
due to your betters--and Iâ€™m eâ€™en wae for you, Dougal, for it canna be
but that in the life ye lead you suld get a Jeddart cast ae day suner or
later. I trust, considering my services as a magistrate, and my father
the deaconâ€™s afore me, I hae interest eneugh in the council to gar them
wink a wee at a waur faut than yours.

Sae I hae been thinking, that if ye will gang back to Glasgow wiâ€™ us,
being a strong-backit creature, ye might be employed in the warehouse
till something better suld cast up.â€

â€œHer nainsell muckle obliged till the Bailieâ€™s honour,â€ replied Dougal;
â€œbut teil be in her shanks fan she gangs on a cause-wayâ€™d street, unless
she be drawn up the Gallowgate wiâ€™ tows, as she was before.â€

In fact, I afterwards learned that Dougal had originally come to Glasgow
as a prisoner, from being concerned in some depredation, but had somehow
found such favour in the eyes of the jailor, that, with rather
overweening confidence, he had retained him in his service as one of the
turnkeys; a task which Dougal had discharged with sufficient fidelity, so
far as was known, until overcome by his clannish prejudices on the
unexpected appearance of his old leader.

Astonished at receiving so round a refusal to so favourable an offer, the
Bailie, turning to me, observed, that the â€œcreature was a natural-born
idiot.â€ I testified my own gratitude in a way which Dougal much better
relished, by slipping a couple of guineas into his hand. He no sooner
felt the touch of the gold, than he sprung twice or thrice from the earth
with the agility of a wild buck, flinging out first one heel and then
another, in a manner which would have astonished a French dancing-master.
He ran to the boatmen to show them the prize, and a small gratuity made
them take part in his raptures. He then, to use a favourite expression of
the dramatic John Bunyan, â€œwent on his way, and I saw him no more.â€

The Bailie and I mounted our horses, and proceeded on the road to
Glasgow. When we had lost the view of the lake, and its superb
amphitheatre of mountains, I could not help expressing with enthusiasm,
my sense of its natural beauties, although I was conscious that Mr.
Jarvie was a very uncongenial spirit to communicate with on such a
subject.

â€œYe are a young gentleman,â€ he replied, â€œand an Englishman, and aâ€™ this
may be very fine to you; but for me, wha am a plain man, and ken
something oâ€™ the different values of land, I wadna gie the finest sight
we hae seen in the Hielands, for the first keek oâ€™ the Gorbals oâ€™
Glasgow; and if I were ance there, it suldna be every fuleâ€™s errand,
begging your pardon, Mr. Francis, that suld take me out oâ€™ sight oâ€™ Saint
Mungoâ€™s steeple again!â€

The honest man had his wish; for, by dint of travelling very late, we
arrived at his own house that night, or rather on the succeeding morning.
Having seen my worthy fellow-traveller safely consigned to the charge of
the considerate and officious Mattie, I proceeded to Mrs. Flyterâ€™s, in
whose house, even at this unwonted hour, light was still burning. The
door was opened by no less a person than Andrew Fairservice himself, who,
upon the first sound of my voice, set up a loud shout of joyful
recognition, and, without uttering a syllable, ran up stairs towards a
parlour on the second floor, from the windows of which the light
proceeded. Justly conceiving that he went to announce my return to the
anxious Owen, I followed him upon the foot. Owen was not alone, there was
another in the apartment--it was my father.

The first impulse was to preserve the dignity of his usual
equanimity,--â€œFrancis, I am glad to see you.â€ The next was to embrace me
tenderly,--â€œMy dear--dear son!â€--Owen secured one of my hands, and
wetted it with his tears, while he joined in gratulating my return.
These are scenes which address themselves to the eye and to the heart
rather than to the ear--My old eye-lids still moisten at the
recollection of our meeting; but your kind and affectionate feelings
can well imagine what I should find it impossible to describe.

When the tumult of our joy was over, I learnt that my father had arrived
from Holland shortly after Owen had set off for Scotland. Determined and
rapid in all his movements, he only stopped to provide the means of
discharging the obligations incumbent on his house. By his extensive
resources, with funds enlarged, and credit fortified, by eminent success
in his continental speculation, he easily accomplished what perhaps his
absence alone rendered difficult, and set out for Scotland to exact
justice from Rashleigh Osbaldistone, as well as to put order to his
affairs in that country. My fatherâ€™s arrival in full credit, and with the
ample means of supporting his engagements honourably, as well as
benefiting his correspondents in future, was a stunning blow to MacVittie
and Company, who had conceived his star set for ever. Highly incensed at
the usage his confidential clerk and agent had received at their hands,
Mr. Osbaldistone refused every tender of apology and accommodation; and
having settled the balance of their account, announced to them that, with
all its numerous contingent advantages, that leaf of their ledger was
closed for ever.

While he enjoyed this triumph over false friends, he was not a little
alarmed on my account. Owen, good man, had not supposed it possible that
a journey of fifty or sixty miles, which may be made with so much ease
and safety in any direction from London, could be attended with any
particular danger. But he caught alarm, by sympathy, from my father, to
whom the country, and the lawless character of its inhabitants, were
better known.

These apprehensions were raised to agony, when, a few hours before I
arrived, Andrew Fairservice made his appearance, with a dismal and
exaggerated account of the uncertain state in which he had left me. The
nobleman with whose troops he had been a sort of prisoner, had, after
examination, not only dismissed him, but furnished him with the means of
returning rapidly to Glasgow, in order to announce to my friends my
precarious and unpleasant situation.

Andrew was one of those persons who have no objection to the sort of
temporary attention and woeful importance which attaches itself to the
bearer of bad tidings, and had therefore by no means smoothed down his
tale in the telling, especially as the rich London merchant himself
proved unexpectedly one of the auditors. He went at great length into an
account of the dangers I had escaped, chiefly, as he insinuated, by means
of his own experience, exertion, and sagacity.

â€œWhat was to come of me now, when my better angel, in his (Andrewâ€™s)
person, was removed from my side, it was,â€ he said, â€œsad and sair to
conjecture; that the Bailie was nae better than just naebody at a pinch,
or something waur, for he was a conceited body--and Andrew hated
conceit--but certainly, atween the pistols and the carabines of the
troopers, that rappit aff the tane after the tother as fast as hail, and
the dirks and claymores oâ€™ the Hielanders, and the deep waters and weils
oâ€™ the Avondow, it was to be thought there wad be a puir account of the
young gentleman.â€

This statement would have driven Owen to despair, had he been alone and
unsupported; but my fatherâ€™s perfect knowledge of mankind enabled him
easily to appreciate the character of Andrew, and the real amount of his
intelligence. Stripped of all exaggeration, however, it was alarming
enough to a parent. He determined to set out in person to obtain my
liberty by ransom or negotiation, and was busied with Owen till a late
hour, in order to get through some necessary correspondence, and devolve
on the latter some business which should be transacted during his
absence; and thus it chanced that I found them watchers.

It was late ere we separated to rest, and, too impatient long to endure
repose, I was stirring early the next morning. Andrew gave his attendance
at my levee, as in duty bound, and, instead of the scarecrow figure to
which he had been reduced at Aberfoil, now appeared in the attire of an
undertaker, a goodly suit, namely, of the deepest mourning. It was not
till after one or two queries, which the rascal affected as long as he
could to misunderstand, that I found out he â€œhad thought it but decent to
put on mourning, on account of my inexpressible loss; and as the broker
at whose shop he had equipped himself, declined to receive the goods
again, and as his own garments had been destroyed or carried off in my
honourâ€™s service, doubtless I and my honourable father, whom Providence
had blessed wiâ€™ the means, wadna suffer a puir lad to sit down wiâ€™ the
loss; a stand oâ€™ claes was nae great matter to an Osbaldistone (be
praised forâ€™t!), especially to an old and attached servant oâ€™ the house.â€

As there was something of justice in Andrewâ€™s plea of loss in my service,
his finesse succeeded; and he came by a good suit of mourning, with a
beaver and all things conforming, as the exterior signs of woe for a
master who was alive and merry.

My fatherâ€™s first care, when he arose, was to visit Mr. Jarvie, for whose
kindness he entertained the most grateful sentiments, which he expressed
in very few, but manly and nervous terms. He explained the altered state
of his affairs, and offered the Bailie, on such terms as could not but be
both advantageous and acceptable, that part in his concerns which had
been hitherto managed by MacVittie and Company. The Bailie heartily
congratulated my father and Owen on the changed posture of their affairs,
and, without affecting to disclaim that he had done his best to serve
them, when matters looked otherwise, he said, â€œHe had only just acted as
he wad be done by--that, as to the extension of their correspondence, he
frankly accepted it with thanks. Had MacVittieâ€™s folk behaved like honest
men,â€ he said, â€œhe wad hae liked ill to hae come in ahint them, and out
afore them this gate. But itâ€™s otherwise, and they maun eâ€™en stand the
loss.â€

The Bailie then pulled me by the sleeve into a corner, and, after again
cordially wishing me joy, proceeded, in rather an embarrassed tone--â€œI
wad heartily wish, Maister Francis, there suld be as little said as
possible about the queer things we saw up yonder awa. Thereâ€™s nae gude,
unless ane were judicially examinate, to say onything about that awfuâ€™
job oâ€™ Morris--and the members oâ€™ the council wadna think it creditable
in ane of their body to be fighting wiâ€™ a wheen Hielandmen, and singeing
their plaidens--And abune aâ€™, though I am a decent sponsible man, when I
am on my right end, I canna but think I maun hae made a queer figure
without my hat and my periwig, hinging by the middle like bawdrons, or a
cloak flung ower a cloak-pin. Bailie Grahame wad hae an unco hair in my
neck an he got that tale by the end.â€

I could not suppress a smile when I recollected the Bailieâ€™s situation,
although I certainly thought it no laughing matter at the time. The
good-natured merchant was a little confused, but smiled also when he
shook his head--â€œI see how it is--I see how it is. But say naething about
it--thereâ€™s a gude callant; and charge that lang-tongued, conceited,
upsetting serving man oâ€™ yours, to sae naething neither. I wadna for ever
sae muckle that even the lassock Mattie kenâ€™d onything about it. I wad
never hear an end oâ€™t.â€

He was obviously relieved from his impending fears of ridicule, when I
told him it was my fatherâ€™s intention to leave Glasgow almost
immediately. Indeed he had now no motive for remaining, since the most
valuable part of the papers carried off by Rashleigh had been recovered.
For that portion which he had converted into cash and expended in his own
or on political intrigues, there was no mode of recovering it but by a
suit at law, which was forthwith commenced, and proceeded, as our
law-agents assured us, with all deliberate speed.

We spent, accordingly, one hospitable day with the Bailie, and took leave
of him, as this narrative now does. He continued to grow in wealth,
honour, and credit, and actually rose to the highest civic honours in his
native city. About two years after the period I have mentioned, he tired
of his bachelor life, and promoted Mattie from her wheel by the kitchen
fire to the upper end of his table, in the character of Mrs. Jarvie.
Bailie Grahame, the MacVitties, and others (for all men have their
enemies, especially in the council of a royal burgh), ridiculed this
transformation. â€œBut,â€ said Mr. Jarvie, â€œlet them say their say. Iâ€™ll
neâ€™er fash mysell, nor lose my liking for sae feckless a matter as a nine
daysâ€™ clash. My honest father the deacon had a byword,

                       Brent brow and lily skin,
                       A loving heart, and a leal within,
                      Is better than gowd or gentle kin.

Besides,â€ as he always concluded, â€œMattie was nae ordinary lassock-quean;
she was akin to the Laird oâ€™ Limmerfield.â€

Whether it was owing to her descent or her good gifts, I do not presume
to decide; but Mattie behaved excellently in her exaltation, and relieved
the apprehensions of some of the Bailieâ€™s friends, who had deemed his
experiment somewhat hazardous. I do not know that there was any other
incident of his quiet and useful life worthy of being particularly
recorded.





CHAPTER TWENTIETH.

                  â€œCome ye hither my â€˜sixâ€™ good sons,
                       Gallant men I trow ye be,
                  How many of you, my children dear,
                  Will stand by that good Earl and me?â€

                     â€œFiveâ€ of them did answer make--
                     â€œFiveâ€ of them spoke hastily,
                     â€œO father, till the day we die,
                  Weâ€™ll stand by that good Earl and thee.â€
                                    The Rising in the North.

On the morning when we were to depart from Glasgow, Andrew Fairservice
bounced into my apartment like a madman, jumping up and down, and
singing, with more vehemence than tune,

                The kilnâ€™s on fire--the kilnâ€™s on fire--
                The kilnâ€™s on fire--sheâ€™s aâ€™ in a lowe.

With some difficulty I prevailed on him to cease his confounded clamour,
and explain to me what the matter was. He was pleased to inform me, as if
he had been bringing the finest news imaginable, â€œthat the Hielands were
clean broken out, every man oâ€™ them, and that Rob Roy, and aâ€™ his
breekless bands, wad be down upon Glasgow or twenty-four hours oâ€™ the
clock gaed round.â€

â€œHold your tongue,â€ said I, â€œyou rascal! You must be drunk or mad; and if
there is any truth in your news, is it a singing matter, you scoundrel?â€

â€œDrunk or mad? nae doubt,â€ replied Andrew, dauntlessly; â€œaneâ€™s aye drunk
or mad if he tells what grit folks dinna like to hear--Sing? Od, the
clans will make us sing on the wrang side oâ€™ our mouth, if we are sae
drunk or mad as to bide their coming.â€

I rose in great haste, and found my father and Owen also on foot, and in
considerable alarm.

Andrewâ€™s news proved but too true in the main. The great rebellion which
agitated Britain in the year 1715 had already broken out, by the
unfortunate Earl of Marâ€™s setting up the standard of the Stuart family in
an ill-omened hour, to the ruin of many honourable families, both in
England and Scotland. The treachery of some of the Jacobite agents
(Rashleigh among the rest), and the arrest of others, had made George the
Firstâ€™s Government acquainted with the extensive ramifications of a
conspiracy long prepared, and which at last exploded prematurely, and in
a part of the kingdom too distant to have any vital effect upon the
country, which, however, was plunged into much confusion.

This great public event served to confirm and elucidate the obscure
explanations I had received from MacGregor; and I could easily see why
the westland clans, who were brought against him, should have waived
their private quarrel, in consideration that they were all shortly to be
engaged in the same public cause. It was a more melancholy reflection to
my mind, that Diana Vernon was the wife of one of those who were most
active in turning the world upside down, and that she was herself exposed
to all the privations and perils of her husbandâ€™s hazardous trade.

We held an immediate consultation on the measures we were to adopt in
this crisis, and acquiesced in my fatherâ€™s plan, that we should instantly
get the necessary passports, and make the best of our way to London. I
acquainted my father with my wish to offer my personal service to the
Government in any volunteer corps, several being already spoken of. He
readily acquiesced in my proposal; for though he disliked war as a
profession, yet, upon principle, no man would have exposed his life more
willingly in defence of civil and religious liberty.

We travelled in haste and in peril through Dumfriesshire and the
neighbouring counties of England. In this quarter, gentlemen of the Tory
interest were already in motion, mustering men and horses, while the
Whigs assembled themselves in the principal towns, armed the inhabitants,
and prepared for civil war. We narrowly escaped being stopped on more
occasions than one, and were often compelled to take circuitous routes to
avoid the points where forces were assembling.

When we reached London, we immediately associated with those bankers and
eminent merchants who agreed to support the credit of Government, and to
meet that run upon the funds, on which the conspirators had greatly
founded their hopes of furthering their undertaking, by rendering the
Government, as it were, bankrupt. My father was chosen one of the members
of this formidable body of the monied interest, as all had the greatest
confidence in his zeal, skill, and activity. He was also the organ by
which they communicated with Government, and contrived, from funds
belonging to his own house, or over which he had command, to find
purchasers for a quantity of the national stock, which was suddenly flung
into the market at a depreciated price when the rebellion broke out. I
was not idle myself, but obtained a commission, and levied, at my
fatherâ€™s expense, about two hundred men, with whom I joined General
Carpenterâ€™s army.

The rebellion, in the meantime, had extended itself to England. The
unfortunate Earl of Derwentwater had taken arms in the cause, along with
General Foster. My poor uncle, Sir Hildebrand, whose estate was reduced
to almost nothing by his own carelessness and the expense and debauchery
of his sons and household, was easily persuaded to join that unfortunate
standard. Before doing so, however, he exhibited a degree of precaution
of which no one could have suspected him--he made his will!

By this document he devised his estates at Osbaldistone Hall, and so
forth, to his sons successively, and their male heirs, until he came to
Rashleigh, whom, on account of the turn he had lately taken in politics,
he detested with all his might,--he cut him off with a shilling, and
settled the estate on me as his next heir. I had always been rather a
favourite of the old gentleman; but it is probable that, confident in the
number of gigantic youths who now armed around him, he considered the
destination as likely to remain a dead letter, which he inserted chiefly
to show his displeasure at Rashleighâ€™s treachery, both public and
domestic. There was an article, by which he, bequeathed to the niece of
his late wife, Diana Vernon, now Lady Diana Vernon Beauchamp, some
diamonds belonging to her late aunt, and a great silver ewer, having the
arms of Vernon and Osbaldistone quarterly engraven upon it.

But Heaven had decreed a more speedy extinction of his numerous and
healthy lineage, than, most probably, he himself had reckoned on. In the
very first muster of the conspirators, at a place called Green-Rigg,
Thorncliff Osbaldistone quarrelled about precedence with a gentleman of
the Northumbrian border, to the full as fierce and intractable as
himself. In spite of all remonstrances, they gave their commander a
specimen of how far their discipline might be relied upon, by fighting it
out with their rapiers, and my kinsman was killed on the spot. His death
was a great loss to Sir Hildebrand, for, notwithstanding his infernal
temper, he had a grain or two of more sense than belonged to the rest of
the brotherhood, Rashleigh always excepted.

Perceval, the sot, died also in his calling. He had a wager with another
gentleman (who, from his exploits in that line, had acquired the
formidable epithet of Brandy Swalewell), which should drink the largest
cup of strong liquor when King James was proclaimed by the insurgents at
Morpeth. The exploit was something enormous. I forget the exact quantity
of brandy which Percie swallowed, but it occasioned a fever, of which he
expired at the end of three days, with the word, _water, water,_
perpetually on his tongue.

Dickon broke his neck near Warrington Bridge, in an attempt to show off a
foundered blood-mare which he wished to palm upon a Manchester merchant
who had joined the insurgents. He pushed the animal at a five-barred
gate; she fell in the leap, and the unfortunate jockey lost his life.

Wilfred the fool, as sometimes befalls, had the best fortune of the
family. He was slain at Proud Preston, in Lancashire, on the day that
General Carpenter attacked the barricades, fighting with great bravery,
though I have heard he was never able exactly to comprehend the cause of
quarrel, and did not uniformly remember on which kingâ€™s side he was
engaged. John also behaved very boldly in the same engagement, and
received several wounds, of which he was not happy enough to die on the
spot.

Old Sir Hildebrand, entirely brokenhearted by these successive losses,
became, by the next dayâ€™s surrender, one of the unhappy prisoners, and
was lodged in Newgate with his wounded son John.

I was now released from my military duty, and lost no time, therefore, in
endeavouring to relieve the distresses of these new relations. My
fatherâ€™s interest with Government, and the general compassion excited by
a parent who had sustained the successive loss of so many sons within so
short a time, would have prevented my uncle and cousin from being brought
to trial for high treason. But their doom was given forth from a greater
tribunal. John died of his wounds in Newgate, recommending to me in his
last breath, a cast of hawks which he had at the Hall, and a black
spaniel bitch called Lucy.

My poor uncle seemed beaten down to the very earth by his family
calamities, and the circumstances in which he unexpectedly found himself.
He said little, but seemed grateful for such attentions as circumstances
permitted me to show him. I did not witness his meeting with my father
for the first time for so many years, and under circumstances so
melancholy; but, judging from my fatherâ€™s extreme depression of spirits,
it must have been melancholy in the last degree. Sir Hildebrand spoke
with great bitterness against Rashleigh, now his only surviving child;
laid upon him the ruin of his house, and the deaths of all his brethren,
and declared, that neither he nor they would have plunged into political
intrigue, but for that very member of his family, who had been the first
to desert them. He once or twice mentioned Diana, always with great
affection; and once he said, while I sate by his bedside--â€œNevoy, since
Thorncliff and all of them are dead, I am sorry you cannot have her.â€

The expression affected me much at the time; for it was a usual custom of
the poor old baronetâ€™s, when joyously setting forth upon the morningâ€™s
chase, to distinguish Thorncliff, who was a favourite, while he summoned
the rest more generally; and the loud jolly tone in which he used to
hollo, â€œCall Thornie--call all of them,â€ contrasted sadly with the
woebegone and self-abandoning note in which he uttered the disconsolate
words which I have above quoted. He mentioned the contents of his will,
and supplied me with an authenticated copy;--the original he had
deposited with my old acquaintance Mr. Justice Inglewood, who, dreaded by
no one, and confided in by all as a kind of neutral person, had become,
for aught I know, the depositary of half the wills of the fighting men of
both factions in the county of Northumberland.

The greater part of my uncleâ€™s last hours were spent in the discharge of
the religious duties of his church, in which he was directed by the
chaplain of the Sardinian ambassador, for whom, with some difficulty, we
obtained permission to visit him. I could not ascertain by my own
observation, or through the medical attendants, that Sir Hildebrand
Osbaldistone died of any formed complaint bearing a name in the science
of medicine. He seemed to me completely worn out and broken down by
fatigue of body and distress of mind, and rather ceased to exist, than
died of any positive struggle,--just as a vessel, buffeted and tossed by
a succession of tempestuous gales, her timbers overstrained, and her
joints loosened, will sometimes spring a leak and founder, when there are
no apparent causes for her destruction.

It was a remarkable circumstance that my father, after the last duties
were performed to his brother, appeared suddenly to imbibe a strong
anxiety that I should act upon the will, and represent his fatherâ€™s
house, which had hitherto seemed to be the thing in the world which had
least charms for him. But formerly, he had been like the fox in the
fable, contemning what was beyond his reach; and, moreover, I doubt not
that the excessive dislike which he entertained against Rashleigh (now
Sir Rashleigh) Osbaldistone, who loudly threatened to attack his father
Sir Hildebrandâ€™s will and settlement, corroborated my fatherâ€™s desire to
maintain it.

â€œHe had been most unjustly disinherited,â€ he said, â€œby his own
father--his brotherâ€™s will had repaired the disgrace, if not the injury,
by leaving the wreck of his property to Frank, the natural heir, and he
was determined the bequest should take effect.â€

In the meantime, Rashleigh was not altogether a contemptible personage as
an opponent. The information he had given to Government was critically
well-timed, and his extreme plausibility, with the extent of his
intelligence, and the artful manner in which he contrived to assume both
merit and influence, had, to a certain extent, procured him patrons among
Ministers. We were already in the full tide of litigation with him on the
subject of his pillaging the firm of Osbaldistone and Tresham; and,
judging from the progress we made in that comparatively simple lawsuit,
there was a chance that this second course of litigation might be drawn
out beyond the period of all our natural lives.

To avert these delays as much as possible, my father, by the advice of
his counsel learned in the law, paid off and vested in my person the
rights to certain large mortgages affecting Osbaldistone Hall. Perhaps,
however, the opportunity to convert a great share of the large profits
which accrued from the rapid rise of the funds upon the suppression of
the rebellion, and the experience he had so lately had of the perils of
commerce, encouraged him to realise, in this manner, a considerable part
of his property. At any rate, it so chanced, that, instead of commanding
me to the desk, as I fully expected, having intimated my willingness to
comply with his wishes, however they might destine me, I received his
directions to go down to Osbaldistone Hall, and take possession of it as
the heir and representative of the family. I was directed to apply to
Squire Inglewood for the copy of my uncleâ€™s will deposited with him, and
take all necessary measures to secure that possession which sages say
makes nine points of the law.

At another time I should have been delighted with this change of
destination. But now Osbaldistone Hall was accompanied with many painful
recollections. Still, however, I thought, that in that neighbourhood only
I was likely to acquire some information respecting the fate of Diana
Vernon. I had every reason to fear it must be far different from what I
could have wished it. But I could obtain no precise information on the
subject.

It was in vain that I endeavoured, by such acts of kindness as their
situation admitted, to conciliate the confidence of some distant
relations who were among the prisoners in Newgate. A pride which I could
not condemn, and a natural suspicion of the Whig Frank Osbaldistone,
cousin to the double-distilled traitor Rashleigh, closed every heart and
tongue, and I only received thanks, cold and extorted, in exchange for
such benefits as I had power to offer. The arm of the law was also
gradually abridging the numbers of those whom I endeavoured to serve, and
the hearts of the survivors became gradually more contracted towards all
whom they conceived to be concerned with the existing Government. As they
were led gradually, and by detachments, to execution, those who survived
lost interest in mankind, and the desire of communicating with them. I
shall long remember what one of them, Ned Shafton by name, replied to my
anxious inquiry, whether there was any indulgence I could procure him?
â€œMr. Frank Osbaldistone, I must suppose you mean me kindly, and therefore
I thank you. But, by G--, men cannot be fattened like poultry, when they
see their neighbours carried off day by day to the place of execution,
and know that their own necks are to be twisted round in their turn.â€

Upon the whole, therefore, I was glad to escape from London, from
Newgate, and from the scenes which both exhibited, to breathe the free
air of Northumberland. Andrew Fairservice had continued in my service
more from my fatherâ€™s pleasure than my own. At present there seemed a
prospect that his local acquaintance with Osbaldistone Hall and its
vicinity might be useful; and, of course, he accompanied me on my
journey, and I enjoyed the prospect of getting rid of him, by
establishing him in his old quarters. I cannot conceive how he could
prevail upon my father to interest himself in him, unless it were by the
art, which he possessed in no inconsiderable degree, of affecting an
extreme attachment to his master; which theoretical attachment he made
compatible in practice with playing all manner of tricks without scruple,
providing only against his master being cheated by any one but himself.

We performed our journey to the North without any remarkable adventure,
and we found the country, so lately agitated by rebellion, now peaceful
and in good order. The nearer we approached to Osbaldistone Hall, the
more did my heart sink at the thought of entering that deserted mansion;
so that, in order to postpone the evil day, I resolved first to make my
visit at Mr. Justice Inglewoodâ€™s.

That venerable person had been much disturbed with thoughts of what he
had been, and what he now was; and natural recollections of the past had
interfered considerably with the active duty which in his present
situation might have been expected from him. He was fortunate, however,
in one respect; he had got rid of his clerk Jobson, who had finally left
him in dudgeon at his inactivity, and become legal assistant to a certain
Squire Standish, who had lately commenced operations in those parts as a
justice, with a zeal for King George and the Protestant succession,
which, very different from the feelings of his old patron, Mr. Jobson had
more occasion to restrain within the bounds of the law, than to stimulate
to exertion.

Old Justice Inglewood received me with great courtesy, and readily
exhibited my uncleâ€™s will, which seemed to be without a flaw. He was for
some time in obvious distress, how he should speak and act in my
presence; but when he found, that though a supporter of the present
Government upon principle, I was disposed to think with pity on those who
had opposed it on a mistaken feeling of loyalty and duty, his discourse
became a very diverting medley of what he had done, and what he had left
undone,--the pains he had taken to prevent some squires from joining, and
to wink at the escape of others, who had been so unlucky as to engage in
the affair.

We were _tete-aâ€™-tete,_ and several bumpers had been quaffed by the
Justiceâ€™s special desire, when, on a sudden, he requested me to fill a
_bona fide_ brimmer to the health of poor dear Die Vernon, the rose of
the wilderness, the heath-bell of Cheviot, and the blossom thatâ€™s
transplanted to an infernal convent.

â€œIs not Miss Vernon married, then?â€ I exclaimed, in great astonishment.
â€œI thought his Excellencyâ€--

â€œPooh! pooh! his Excellency and his Lordshipâ€™s all a humbug now, you
know--mere St. Germains titles--Earl of Beauchamp, and ambassador
plenipotentiary from France, when the Duke Regent of Orleans scarce knew
that he lived, I dare say. But you must have seen old Sir Frederick
Vernon at the Hall, when he played the part of Father Vaughan?â€

â€œGood Heavens! then Vaughan was Miss Vernonâ€™s father?â€

â€œTo be sure he was,â€ said the Justice coolly;--â€œthereâ€™s no use in
keeping the secret now, for he must be out of the country by this
time--otherwise, no doubt, it would be my duty to apprehend him.--Come,
off with your bumper to my dear lost Die!

                 And let her health go round, around, around,
                     And let her health go round;
                 For though your stocking be of silk,
                 Your knees near kiss the ground, aground, aground.â€ 

I was unable, as the reader may easily conceive, to join in the Justiceâ€™s
jollity. My head swam with the shock I had received. â€œI never heard,â€ I
said, â€œthat Miss Vernonâ€™s father was living.â€

â€œIt was not our Governmentâ€™s fault that he is,â€ replied Inglewood, â€œfor
the devil a man there is whose head would have brought more money. He was
condemned to death for Fenwickâ€™s plot, and was thought to have had some
hand in the Knightsbridge affair, in King Williamâ€™s time; and as he had
married in Scotland a relation of the house of Breadalbane, he possessed
great influence with all their chiefs. There was a talk of his being
demanded to be given up at the peace of Ryswick, but he shammed ill, and
his death was given publicly out in the French papers. But when he came
back here on the old score, we old cavaliers knew him well,--that is to
say, I knew him, not as being a cavalier myself, but no information being
lodged against the poor gentleman, and my memory being shortened by
frequent attacks of the gout, I could not have sworn to him, you know.â€

â€œWas he, then, not known at Osbaldistone Hall?â€ I inquired.

â€œTo none but to his daughter, the old knight, and Rashleigh, who had got
at that secret as he did at every one else, and held it like a twisted
cord about poor Dieâ€™s neck. I have seen her one hundred times she would
have spit at him, if it had not been fear for her father, whose life
would not have been worth five minutesâ€™ purchase if he had been
discovered to the Government.--But donâ€™t mistake me, Mr. Osbaldistone; I
say the Government is a good, a gracious, and a just Government; and if
it has hanged one-half of the rebels, poor things, all will acknowledge
they would not have been touched had they staid peaceably at home.â€

Waiving the discussion of these political questions, I brought back Mr.
Inglewood to his subject, and I found that Diana, having positively
refused to marry any of the Osbaldistone family, and expressed her
particular detestation of Rashleigh, he had from that time begun to cool
in zeal for the cause of the Pretender; to which, as the youngest of six
brethren, and bold, artful, and able, he had hitherto looked forward as
the means of making his fortune. Probably the compulsion with which he
had been forced to render up the spoils which he had abstracted from my
fatherâ€™s counting-house by the united authority of Sir Frederick Vernon
and the Scottish Chiefs, had determined his resolution to advance his
progress by changing his opinions and betraying his trust. Perhaps
also--for few men were better judges where his interest was concerned--he
considered their means and talents to be, as they afterwards proved,
greatly inadequate to the important task of overthrowing an established
Government. Sir Frederick Vernon, or, as he was called among the
Jacobites, his Excellency Viscount Beauchamp, had, with his daughter,
some difficulty in escaping the consequences of Rashleighâ€™s information.
Here Mr. Inglewoodâ€™s information was at fault; but he did not doubt,
since we had not heard of Sir Frederick being in the hands of the
Government, he must be by this time abroad, where, agreeably to the cruel
bond he had entered into with his brother-in-law, Diana, since she had
declined to select a husband out of the Osbaldistone family, must be
confined to a convent. The original cause of this singular agreement Mr.
Inglewood could not perfectly explain; but he understood it was a family
compact, entered into for the purpose of securing to Sir Frederick the
rents of the remnant of his large estates, which had been vested in the
Osbaldistone family by some legal manoeuvre; in short, a family compact,
in which, like many of those undertaken at that time of day, the feelings
of the principal parties interested were no more regarded than if they
had been a part of the live-stock upon the lands.

I cannot tell,--such is the waywardness of the human heart,--whether this
intelligence gave me joy or sorrow. It seemed to me, that, in the
knowledge that Miss Vernon was eternally divided from me, not by marriage
with another, but by seclusion in a convent, in order to fulfil an absurd
bargain of this kind, my regret for her loss was aggravated rather than
diminished. I became dull, low-spirited, absent, and unable to support
the task of conversing with Justice Inglewood, who in his turn yawned,
and proposed to retire early. I took leave of him overnight, determining
the next day, before breakfast, to ride over to Osbaldistone Hall.

Mr. Inglewood acquiesced in my proposal. â€œIt would be well,â€ he said,
â€œthat I made my appearance there before I was known to be in the country,
the more especially as Sir Rashleigh Osbaldistone was now, he understood,
at Mr. Jobsonâ€™s house, hatching some mischief, doubtless. They were fit
company,â€ he added, â€œfor each other, Sir Rashleigh having lost all right
to mingle in the society of men of honour; but it was hardly possible two
such d--d rascals should collogue together without mischief to honest
people.â€

He concluded, by earnestly recommending a toast and tankard, and an
attack upon his venison pasty, before I set out in the morning, just to
break the cold air on the words.





CHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.

                   His masterâ€™s gone, and no one now
                       Dwells in the halls of Ivor;
                   Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead,
                       He is the sole survivor.
                                         Wordsworth.

There are few more melancholy sensations than those with which we regard
scenes of past pleasure when altered and deserted. In my ride to
Osbaldistone Hall, I passed the same objects which I had seen in company
with Miss Vernon on the day of our memorable ride from Inglewood Place.
Her spirit seemed to keep me company on the way; and when I approached
the spot where I had first seen her, I almost listened for the cry of the
hounds and the notes of the horn, and strained my eye on the vacant
space, as if to descry the fair huntress again descend like an apparition
from the hill. But all was silent, and all was solitary. When I reached
the Hall, the closed doors and windows, the grass-grown pavement, the
courts, which were now so silent, presented a strong contrast to the gay
and bustling scene I had so often seen them exhibit, when the merry
hunters were going forth to their morning sport, or returning to the
daily festival. The joyous bark of the fox-hounds as they were uncoupled,
the cries of the huntsmen, the clang of the horsesâ€™ hoofs, the loud laugh
of the old knight at the head of his strong and numerous descendants,
were all silenced now and for ever.

While I gazed round the scene of solitude and emptiness, I was
inexpressibly affected, even by recollecting those whom, when alive, I
had no reason to regard with affection. But the thought that so many
youths of goodly presence, warm with life, health, and confidence, were
within so short a time cold in the grave, by various, yet all violent and
unexpected modes of death, afforded a picture of mortality at which the
mind trembled. It was little consolation to me, that I returned a
proprietor to the halls which I had left almost like a fugitive. My mind
was not habituated to regard the scenes around as my property, and I felt
myself an usurper, at least an intruding stranger, and could hardly
divest myself of the idea, that some of the bulky forms of my deceased
kinsmen were, like the gigantic spectres of a romance, to appear in the
gateway, and dispute my entrance.

While I was engaged in these sad thoughts, my follower Andrew, whose
feelings were of a very different nature, exerted himself in thundering
alternately on every door in the building, calling, at the same time, for
admittance, in a tone so loud as to intimate, that _he,_ at least, was
fully sensible of his newly acquired importance, as squire of the body to
the new lord of the manor. At length, timidly and reluctantly, Anthony
Syddall, my uncleâ€™s aged butler and major-domo, presented himself at a
lower window, well fenced with iron bars, and inquired our business.

â€œWe are come to tak your charge aff your hand, my auld friend,â€ said
Andrew Fairservice; â€œye may gie up your keys as sune as ye like--ilka dog
has his day. Iâ€™ll tak the plate and napery aff your hand. Ye hae had your
ain time oâ€™t, Mr. Syddall; but ilka bean has its black, and ilka path has
its puddle; and it will just set you henceforth to sit at the board-end,
as weel as it did Andrew lang syne.â€

Checking with some difficulty the forwardness of my follower, I explained
to Syddall the nature of my right, and the title I had to demand
admittance into the Hall, as into my own property. The old man seemed
much agitated and distressed, and testified manifest reluctance to give
me entrance, although it was couched in a humble and submissive tone. I
allowed for the agitation of natural feelings, which really did the old
man honour; but continued peremptory in my demand of admittance,
explaining to him that his refusal would oblige me to apply for Mr.
Inglewoodâ€™s warrant, and a constable.

â€œWe are come from Mr. Justice Inglewoodâ€™s this morning,â€ said Andrew, to
enforce the menace;--â€œand I saw Archie Rutledge, the constable, as I came
up by;--the countryâ€™s no to be lawless as it has been, Mr. Syddall,
letting rebels and papists gang on as they best listed.â€

The threat of the law sounded dreadful in the old manâ€™s ears, conscious
as he was of the suspicion under which he himself lay, from his religion
and his devotion to Sir Hildebrand and his sons. He undid, with fear and
trembling, one of the postern entrances, which was secured with many a
bolt and bar, and humbly hoped that I would excuse him for fidelity in
the discharge of his duty.--I reassured him, and told him I had the
better opinion of him for his caution.

â€œSae have not I,â€ said Andrew; â€œSyddall is an auld sneck-drawer; he wadna
be looking as white as a sheet, and his knees knocking thegither, unless
it were for something mair than heâ€™s like to tell us.â€

â€œLord forgive you, Mr. Fairservice,â€ replied the butler, â€œto say such
things of an old friend and fellow-servant!--Whereâ€--following me humbly
along the passage--â€œwhere would it be your honourâ€™s pleasure to have a
fire lighted? I fear me you will find the house very dull and dreary--But
perhaps you mean to ride back to Inglewood Place to dinner?â€

â€œLight a fire in the library,â€ I replied.

â€œIn the library!â€ answered the old man;--â€œnobody has sat there this many
a day, and the room smokes, for the daws have built in the chimney this
spring, and there were no young men about the Hall to pull them down.â€

â€œOur ain reekes better than other folkâ€™s fire,â€ said Andrew. â€œHis honour
likes the library;--heâ€™s nane oâ€™ your Papishers, that delight in blinded
ignorance, Mr. Syddall.â€

Very reluctantly as it appeared to me, the butler led the way to the
library, and, contrary to what he had given me to expect, the interior of
the apartment looked as if it had been lately arranged, and made more
comfortable than usual. There was a fire in the grate, which burned
clearly, notwithstanding what Syddall had reported of the vent. Taking up
the tongs, as if to arrange the wood, but rather perhaps to conceal his
own confusion, the butler observed, â€œit was burning clear now, but had
smoked woundily in the morning.â€

Wishing to be alone, till I recovered myself from the first painful
sensations which everything around me recalled, I desired old Syddall to
call the land-steward, who lived at about a quarter of a mile from the
Hall. He departed with obvious reluctance. I next ordered Andrew to
procure the attendance of a couple of stout fellows upon whom he could
rely, the population around being Papists, and Sir Rashleigh, who was
capable of any desperate enterprise, being in the neighbourhood. Andrew
Fairservice undertook this task with great cheerfulness, and promised to
bring me up from Trinlay-Knowe, â€œtwa true-blue Presbyterians like
himself, that would face and out-face baith the Pope, the Devil, and the
Pretender--and blythe will I be oâ€™ their company mysell, for the very
last night that I was at Osbaldistone Hall, the blight be on ilka blossom
in my bit yard, if I didna see that very pictureâ€ (pointing to the
full-length portrait of Miss Vernonâ€™s grandfather) â€œwalking by moonlight
in the garden! I tauld your honour I was fleyed wiâ€™ a bogle that night,
but ye wadna listen to me--I aye thought there was witchcraft and
deevilry amang the Papishers, but I neâ€™er sawâ€™t wiâ€™ bodily een till that
awfuâ€™ night.â€

â€œGet along, sir,â€ said I, â€œand bring the fellows you talk of; and see
they have more sense than yourself, and are not frightened at their own
shadow.â€

â€œI hae been counted as gude a man as my neighbours ere now,â€ said Andrew,
petulantly; â€œbut I dinna pretend to deal wiâ€™ evil spirits.â€ And so he
made his exit, as Wardlaw the land-steward made his appearance.

He was a man of sense and honesty, without whose careful management my
uncle would have found it difficult to have maintained himself a
housekeeper so long as he did. He examined the nature of my right of
possession carefully, and admitted it candidly. To any one else the
succession would have been a poor one, so much was the land encumbered
with debt and mortgage. Most of these, however, were already vested in my
fatherâ€™s person, and he was in a train of acquiring the rest; his large
gains by the recent rise of the funds having made it a matter of ease and
convenience for him to pay off the debt which affected his patrimony.

I transacted much necessary business with Mr. Wardlaw, and detained him
to dine with me. We preferred taking our repast in the library, although
Syddall strongly recommended our removing to the stone-hall, which he had
put in order for the occasion. Meantime Andrew made his appearance with
his true-blue recruits, whom he recommended in the highest terms, as
â€œsober decent men, weel founded in doctrinal points, and, above all, as
bold as lions.â€ I ordered them something to drink, and they left the
room. I observed old Syddall shake his head as they went out, and
insisted upon knowing the reason.

â€œI maybe cannot expect,â€ he said, â€œthat your honour should put confidence
in what I say, but it is Heavenâ€™s truth for all that--Ambrose Wingfield
is as honest a man as lives, but if there is a false knave in the
country, it is his brother Lancie;--the whole country knows him to be a
spy for Clerk Jobson on the poor gentlemen that have been in trouble--But
heâ€™s a dissenter, and I suppose thatâ€™s enough now-a-days.â€

Having thus far given vent to his feelings,--to which, however, I was
little disposed to pay attention,--and having placed the wine on the
table, the old butler left the apartment.

Mr. Wardlaw having remained with me until the evening was somewhat
advanced, at length bundled up his papers, and removed himself to his own
habitation, leaving me in that confused state of mind in which we can
hardly say whether we desire company or solitude. I had not, however, the
choice betwixt them; for I was left alone in the room of all others most
calculated to inspire me with melancholy reflections.

As twilight was darkening the apartment, Andrew had the sagacity to
advance his head at the door,--not to ask if I wished for lights, but to
recommend them as a measure of precaution against the bogles which still
haunted his imagination. I rejected his proffer somewhat peevishly,
trimmed the wood-fire, and placing myself in one of the large leathern
chairs which flanked the old Gothic chimney, I watched unconsciously the
bickering of the blaze which I had fostered. â€œAnd this,â€ said I alone,
â€œis the progress and the issue of human wishes! Nursed by the merest
trifles, they are first kindled by fancy--nay, are fed upon the vapour of
hope, till they consume the substance which they inflame; and man, and
his hopes, passions, and desires, sink into a worthless heap of embers
and ashes!â€

There was a deep sigh from the opposite side of the room, which seemed to
reply to my reflections. I started up in amazement--Diana Vernon stood
before me, resting on the arm of a figure so strongly resembling that of
the portrait so often mentioned, that I looked hastily at the frame,
expecting to see it empty. My first idea was, either that I had gone
suddenly distracted, or that the spirits of the dead had arisen and been
placed before me. A second glance convinced me of my being in my senses,
and that the forms which stood before me were real and substantial. It
was Diana herself, though paler and thinner than her former self; and it
was no tenant of the grave who stood beside her, but Vaughan, or rather
Sir Frederick Vernon, in a dress made to imitate that of his ancestor, to
whose picture his countenance possessed a family resemblance. He was the
first that spoke, for Diana kept her eyes fast fixed on the ground, and
astonishment actually riveted my tongue to the roof of my mouth.

â€œWe are your suppliants, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ he said, â€œand we claim the
refuge and protection of your roof till we can pursue a journey where
dungeons and death gape for me at every step.â€

â€œSurely,â€ I articulated with great difficulty--â€œMiss Vernon cannot
suppose--you, sir, cannot believe, that I have forgot your interference
in my difficulties, or that I am capable of betraying any one, much less
you?â€

â€œI know it,â€ said Sir Frederick; â€œyet it is with the most inexpressible
reluctance that I impose on you a confidence, disagreeable
perhaps--certainly dangerous--and which I would have specially wished
to have conferred on some one else. But my fate, which has chased me
through a life of perils and escapes, is now pressing me hard, and I
have no alternative.â€

At this moment the door opened, and the voice of the officious Andrew was
heard--â€œAâ€™m bringinâ€™ in the caunles--Ye can light them gin ye like--Can
do is easy carried about wiâ€™ ane.â€

I ran to the door, which, as I hoped, I reached in time to prevent his
observing who were in the apartment, I turned him out with hasty
violence, shut the door after him, and locked it--then instantly
remembering his two companions below, knowing his talkative humour, and
recollecting Syddallâ€™s remark, that one of them was supposed to be a spy,
I followed him as fast as I could to the servantsâ€™ hall, in which they
were assembled. Andrewâ€™s tongue was loud as I opened the door, but my
unexpected appearance silenced him.

â€œWhat is the matter with you, you fool?â€ said I; â€œyou stare and look
wild, as if you had seen a ghost.â€

â€œN--n--no--nothing,â€ said Andrew.--â€œbut your worship was pleased to be
hasty.â€

â€œBecause you disturbed me out of a sound sleep, you fool. Syddall tells
me he cannot find beds for these good fellows tonight, and Mr. Wardlaw
thinks there will be no occasion to detain them. Here is a crown-piece
for them to drink my health, and thanks for their good-will. You will
leave the Hall immediately, my good lads.â€

The men thanked me for my bounty, took the silver, and withdrew,
apparently unsuspicious and contented. I watched their departure until I
was sure they could have no further intercourse that night with honest
Andrew. And so instantly had I followed on his heels, that I thought he
could not have had time to speak two words with them before I interrupted
him. But it is wonderful what mischief may be done by only two words. On
this occasion they cost two lives.

Having made these arrangements, the best which occurred to me upon the
pressure of the moment, to secure privacy for my guests, I returned to
report my proceedings, and added, that I had desired Syddall to answer
every summons, concluding that it was by his connivance they had been
secreted in the Hall. Diana raised her eyes to thank me for the caution.

â€œYou now understand my mystery,â€ she said;--â€œyou know, doubtless, how
near and dear that relative is, who has so often found shelter here; and
will be no longer surprised that Rashleigh, having such a secret at his
command, should rule me with a rod of iron.â€

Her father added, â€œthat it was their intention to trouble me with their
presence as short a time as was possible.â€

I entreated the fugitives to waive every consideration but what affected
their safety, and to rely on my utmost exertions to promote it. This led
to an explanation of the circumstances under which they stood.

â€œI always suspected Rashleigh Osbaldistone,â€ said Sir Frederick; â€œbut his
conduct towards my unprotected child, which with difficulty I wrung from
her, and his treachery in your fatherâ€™s affairs, made me hate and despise
him. In our last interview I concealed not my sentiments, as I should in
prudence have attempted to do; and in resentment of the scorn with which
I treated him, he added treachery and apostasy to his catalogue of
crimes. I at that time fondly hoped that his defection would be of little
consequence. The Earl of Mar had a gallant army in Scotland, and Lord
Derwentwater, with Forster, Kenmure, Winterton, and others, were
assembling forces on the Border. As my connections with these English
nobility and gentry were extensive, it was judged proper that I should
accompany a detachment of Highlanders, who, under Brigadier MacIntosh of
Borlum, crossed the Firth of Forth, traversed the low country of
Scotland, and united themselves on the Borders with the English
insurgents. My daughter accompanied me through the perils and fatigues of
a march so long and difficult.â€

â€œAnd she will never leave her dear father!â€ exclaimed Miss Vernon,
clinging fondly to his arm.

â€œI had hardly joined our English friends, when I became sensible that our
cause was lost. Our numbers diminished instead of increasing, nor were we
joined by any except of our own persuasion. The Tories of the High Church
remained in general undecided, and at length we were cooped up by a
superior force in the little town of Preston. We defended ourselves
resolutely for one day. On the next, the hearts of our leaders failed,
and they resolved to surrender at discretion. To yield myself up on such
terms, were to have laid my head on the block. About twenty or thirty
gentlemen were of my mind: we mounted our horses, and placed my daughter,
who insisted on sharing my fate, in the centre of our little party. My
companions, struck with her courage and filial piety, declared that they
would die rather than leave her behind. We rode in a body down a street
called Fishergate, which leads to a marshy ground or meadow, extending to
the river Ribble, through which one of our party promised to show us a
good ford. This marsh had not been strongly invested by the enemy, so
that we had only an affair with a patrol of Honeywoodâ€™s dragoons, whom we
dispersed and cut to pieces. We crossed the river, gained the high road
to Liverpool, and then dispersed to seek several places of concealment
and safety. My fortune led me to Wales, where there are many gentlemen of
my religious and political opinions. I could not, however, find a safe
opportunity of escaping by sea, and found myself obliged again to draw
towards the North. A well-tried friend has appointed to meet me in this
neighbourhood, and guide me to a seaport on the Solway, where a sloop is
prepared to carry me from my native country for ever. As Osbaldistone
Hall was for the present uninhabited, and under the charge of old
Syddall, who had been our confidant on former occasions, we drew to it as
to a place of known and secure refuge. I resumed a dress which had been
used with good effect to scare the superstitious rustics, or domestics,
who chanced at any time to see me; and we expected from time to time to
hear by Syddall of the arrival of our friendly guide, when your sudden
coming hither, and occupying this apartment, laid us under the necessity
of submitting to your mercy.â€

Thus ended Sir Fredericks story, whose tale sounded to me like one told
in a vision; and I could hardly bring myself to believe that I saw his
daughterâ€™s form once more before me in flesh and blood, though with
diminished beauty and sunk spirits. The buoyant vivacity with which she
had resisted every touch of adversity, had now assumed the air of
composed and submissive, but dauntless resolution and constancy. Her
father, though aware and jealous of the effect of her praises on my mind,
could not forbear expatiating upon them.

â€œShe has endured trials,â€ he said, â€œwhich might have dignified the
history of a martyr;--she has faced danger and death in various
shapes;--she has undergone toil and privation, from which men of the
strongest frame would have shrunk;--she has spent the day in darkness,
and the night in vigil, and has never breathed a murmur of weakness or
complaint. In a word, Mr. Osbaldistone,â€ he concluded, â€œshe is a worthy
offering to that God, to whomâ€ (crossing himself) â€œI shall dedicate her,
as all that is left dear or precious to Frederick Vernon.â€

There was a silence after these words, of which I well understood the
mournful import. The father of Diana was still as anxious to destroy my
hopes of being united to her now as he had shown himself during our brief
meeting in Scotland.

â€œWe will now,â€ said he to his daughter, â€œintrude no farther on Mr.
Osbaldistoneâ€™s time, since we have acquainted him with the circumstances
of the miserable guests who claim his protection.â€

I requested them to stay, and offered myself to leave the apartment. Sir
Frederick observed, that my doing so could not but excite my attendantâ€™s
suspicion; and that the place of their retreat was in every respect
commodious, and furnished by Syddall with all they could possibly want.
â€œWe might perhaps have even contrived to remain there, concealed from
your observation; but it would have been unjust to decline the most
absolute reliance on your honour.â€

â€œYou have done me but justice,â€ I replied.--â€œTo you, Sir Frederick, I am
but little known; but Miss Vernon, I am sure, will bear me witness thatâ€--

â€œI do not want my daughterâ€™s evidence,â€ he said, politely, but yet with
an air calculated to prevent my addressing myself to Diana, â€œsince I am
prepared to believe all that is worthy of Mr. Francis Osbaldistone.
Permit us now to retire; we must take repose when we can, since we are
absolutely uncertain when we may be called upon to renew our perilous
journey.â€

He drew his daughterâ€™s arm within his, and with a profound reverence,
disappeared with her behind the tapestry.





CHAPTER TWENTY-SECOND.

              But now the hand of fate is on the curtain,
                     And gives the scene to light.
                                         Don Sebastian.

I felt stunned and chilled as they retired. Imagination, dwelling on an
absent object of affection, paints her not only in the fairest light, but
in that in which we most desire to behold her. I had thought of Diana as
she was, when her parting tear dropped on my cheek--when her parting
token, received from the wife of MacGregor, augured her wish to convey
into exile and conventual seclusion the remembrance of my affection. I
saw her; and her cold passive manner, expressive of little except
composed melancholy, disappointed, and, in some degree, almost offended
me.

In the egotism of my feelings, I accused her of indifference--of
insensibility. I upbraided her father with pride--with cruelty--with
fanaticism,--forgetting that both were sacrificing their interest, and
Diana her inclination, to the discharge of what they regarded as their
duty.

Sir Frederick Vernon was a rigid Catholic, who thought the path of
salvation too narrow to be trodden by an heretic; and Diana, to whom her
fatherâ€™s safety had been for many years the principal and moving spring
of thoughts, hopes, and actions, felt that she had discharged her duty in
resigning to his will, not alone her property in the world, but the
dearest affections of her heart. But it was not surprising that I could
not, at such a moment, fully appreciate these honourable motives; yet my
spleen sought no ignoble means of discharging itself.

â€œI am contemned, then,â€ I said, when left to run over the tenor of Sir
Frederickâ€™s communications--â€œI am contemned, and thought unworthy even to
exchange words with her. Be it so; they shall not at least prevent me
from watching over her safety. Here will I remain as an outpost, and,
while under my roof at least, no danger shall threaten her, if it be such
as the arm of one determined man can avert.â€

I summoned Syddall to the library. He came, but came attended by the
eternal Andrew, who, dreaming of great things in consequence of my taking
possession of the Hall and the annexed estates, was resolved to lose
nothing for want of keeping himself in view; and, as often happens to men
who entertain selfish objects, overshot his mark, and rendered his
attentions tedious and inconvenient.

His unrequired presence prevented me from speaking freely to Syddall, and
I dared not send him away for fear of increasing such suspicions as he
might entertain from his former abrupt dismissal from the library. â€œI
shall sleep here, sir,â€ I said, giving them directions to wheel nearer to
the fire an old-fashioned day-bed, or settee. â€œI have much to do, and
shall go late to bed.â€

Syddall, who seemed to understand my look, offered to procure me the
accommodation of a mattress and some bedding. I accepted his offer,
dismissed my attendant, lighted a pair of candles, and desired that I
might not be disturbed till seven in the ensuing morning.

The domestics retired, leaving me to my painful and ill-arranged
reflections, until nature, worn out, should require some repose.

I endeavoured forcibly to abstract my mind from the singular
circumstances in which I found myself placed. Feelings which I had
gallantly combated while the exciting object was remote, were now
exasperated by my immediate neighbourhood to her whom I was so soon to
part with for ever. Her name was written in every book which I attempted
to peruse; and her image forced itself on me in whatever train of thought
I strove to engage myself. It was like the officious slave of Priorâ€™s
Solomon,--

                 Abra was ready ere I named her name,
                 And when I called another, Abra came.

I alternately gave way to these thoughts, and struggled against them,
sometimes yielding to a mood of melting tenderness of sorrow which was
scarce natural to me, sometimes arming myself with the hurt pride of one
who had experienced what he esteemed unmerited rejection. I paced the
library until I had chafed myself into a temporary fever. I then threw
myself on the couch, and endeavoured to dispose myself to sleep;--but it
was in vain that I used every effort to compose myself--that I lay
without movement of finger or of muscle, as still as if I had been
already a corpse--that I endeavoured to divert or banish disquieting
thoughts, by fixing my mind on some act of repetition or arithmetical
process. My blood throbbed, to my feverish apprehension, in pulsations
which resembled the deep and regular strokes of a distant fulling-mill,
and tingled in my veins like streams of liquid fire.

At length I arose, opened the window, and stood by it for some time in
the clear moonlight, receiving, in part at least, that refreshment and
dissipation of ideas from the clear and calm scene, without which they
had become beyond the command of my own volition. I resumed my place on
the couch--with a heart, Heaven knows, not lighter but firmer, and more
resolved for endurance. In a short time a slumber crept over my senses;
still, however, though my senses slumbered, my soul was awake to the
painful feelings of my situation, and my dreams were of mental anguish
and external objects of terror.

I remember a strange agony, under which I conceived myself and Diana in
the power of MacGregorâ€™s wife, and about to be precipitated from a rock
into the lake; the signal was to be the discharge of a cannon, fired by
Sir Frederick Vernon, who, in the dress of a Cardinal, officiated at the
ceremony. Nothing could be more lively than the impression which I
received of this imaginary scene. I could paint, even at this moment, the
mute and courageous submission expressed in Dianaâ€™s features--the wild
and distorted faces of the executioners, who crowded around us with
â€œmopping and mowing;â€ grimaces ever changing, and each more hideous than
that which preceded. I saw the rigid and inflexible fanaticism painted in
the face of the father--I saw him lift the fatal match--the deadly signal
exploded--It was repeated again and again and again, in rival thunders,
by the echoes of the surrounding cliffs, and I awoke from fancied horror
to real apprehension.

The sounds in my dream were not ideal. They reverberated on my waking
ears, but it was two or three minutes ere I could collect myself so as
distinctly to understand that they proceeded from a violent knocking at
the gate. I leaped from my couch in great apprehension, took my sword
under my arm, and hastened to forbid the admission of any one. But my
route was necessarily circuitous, because the library looked not upon the
quadrangle, but into the gardens. When I had reached a staircase, the
windows of which opened upon the entrance court, I heard the feeble and
intimidated tones of Syddall expostulating with rough voices, which
demanded admittance, by the warrant of Justice Standish, and in the
Kingâ€™s name, and threatened the old domestic with the heaviest penal
consequences if he refused instant obedience. Ere they had ceased, I
heard, to my unspeakable provocation, the voice of Andrew bidding Syddall
stand aside, and let him open the door.

â€œIf they come in King Georgeâ€™s name, we have naething to fear--we hae
spent baith bluid and gowd for him--We dinna need to darn ourselves like
some folks, Mr. Syddall--we are neither Papists nor Jacobites, I trow.â€

It was in vain I accelerated my pace down stairs; I heard bolt after bolt
withdrawn by the officious scoundrel, while all the time he was boasting
his own and his masterâ€™s loyalty to King George; and I could easily
calculate that the party must enter before I could arrive at the door to
replace the bars. Devoting the back of Andrew Fairservice to the cudgel
so soon as I should have time to pay him his deserts, I ran back to the
library, barricaded the door as I best could, and hastened to that by
which Diana and her father entered, and begged for instant admittance.
Diana herself undid the door. She was ready dressed, and betrayed neither
perturbation nor fear.

â€œDanger is so familiar to us,â€ she said, â€œthat we are always prepared to
meet it. My father is already up--he is in Rashleighâ€™s apartment. We will
escape into the garden, and thence by the postern-gate (I have the key
from Syddall in case of need.) into the wood--I know its dingles better
than any one now alive. Keep them a few minutes in play. And, dear, dear
Frank, once more fare-thee-well!â€

She vanished like a meteor to join her father, and the intruders were
rapping violently, and attempting to force the library door by the time I
had returned into it.

â€œYou robber dogs!â€ I exclaimed, wilfully mistaking the purpose of their
disturbance, â€œif you do not instantly quit the house I will fire my
blunderbuss through the door.â€

â€œFire a fuleâ€™s bauble!â€ said Andrew Fairservice; â€œitâ€™s Mr. Clerk Jobson,
with a legal warrantâ€--

â€œTo search for, take, and apprehend,â€ said the voice of that execrable
pettifogger, â€œthe bodies of certain persons in my warrant named, charged
of high treason under the 13th of King William, chapter third.â€

And the violence on the door was renewed. â€œI am rising, gentlemen,â€ said
I, desirous to gain as much time as possible--â€œcommit no violence--give
me leave to look at your warrant, and, if it is formal and legal, I shall
not oppose it.â€

â€œGod save great George our King!â€ ejaculated Andrew. â€œI tauld ye that ye
would find nae Jacobites here.â€

Spinning out the time as much as possible, I was at length compelled to
open the door, which they would otherwise have forced.

Mr. Jobson entered, with several assistants, among whom I discovered the
younger Wingfield, to whom, doubtless, he was obliged for his
information, and exhibited his warrant, directed not only against
Frederick Vernon, an attainted traitor, but also against Diana Vernon,
spinster, and Francis Osbaldistone, gentleman, accused of misprision of
treason. It was a case in which resistance would have been madness; I
therefore, after capitulating for a few minutesâ€™ delay, surrendered
myself a prisoner.

I had next the mortification to see Jobson go straight to the chamber of
Miss Vernon, and I learned that from thence, without hesitation or
difficulty, he went to the room where Sir Frederick had slept. â€œThe hare
has stolen away,â€ said the brute, â€œbut her form is warm--the greyhounds
will have her by the haunches yet.â€

A scream from the garden announced that he prophesied too truly. In the
course of five minutes, Rashleigh entered the library with Sir Frederick
Vernon and his daughter as prisoners.

â€œThe fox,â€ he said, â€œknew his old earth, but he forgot it could be
stopped by a careful huntsman.--I had not forgot the garden-gate, Sir
Frederick--or, if that title suits you better, most noble Lord
Beauchamp.â€

â€œRashleigh,â€ said Sir Frederick, â€œthou art a detestable villain!â€

â€œI better deserved the name, Sir Knight, or my Lord, when, under the
direction of an able tutor, I sought to introduce civil war into the
bosom of a peaceful country. But I have done my best,â€ said he, looking
upwards, â€œto atone for my errors.â€

I could hold no longer. I had designed to watch their proceedings in
silence, but I felt that I must speak or die. â€œIf hell,â€ I said, â€œhas one
complexion more hideous than another, it is where villany is masked by
hypocrisy.â€

â€œHa! my gentle cousin,â€ said Rashleigh, holding a candle towards me, and
surveying me from head to foot; â€œright welcome to Osbaldistone Hall!--I
can forgive your spleen--It is hard to lose an estate and a mistress in
one night; for we shall take possession of this poor manor-house in the
name of the lawful heir, Sir Rashleigh Osbaldistone.â€

While Rashleigh braved it out in this manner, I could see that he put a
strong force upon his feelings, both of anger and shame. But his state of
mind was more obvious when Diana Vernon addressed him. â€œRashleigh,â€ she
said, â€œI pity you--for, deep as the evil is which you have laboured to do
me, and the evil you have actually done, I cannot hate you so much as I
scorn and pity you. What you have now done may be the work of an hour,
but will furnish you with reflection for your life--of what nature I
leave to your own conscience, which will not slumber for ever.â€

Rashleigh strode once or twice through the room, came up to the
side-table, on which wine was still standing, and poured out a large
glass with a trembling hand; but when he saw that we observed his tremor,
he suppressed it by a strong effort, and, looking at us with fixed and
daring composure, carried the bumper to his head without spilling a drop.
â€œIt is my fatherâ€™s old burgundy,â€ he said, looking to Jobson; â€œI am glad
there is some of it left.--You will get proper persons to take care of
old butler, and that foolish Scotch rascal. Meanwhile we will convey
these persons to a more proper place of custody. I have provided the old
family coach for your convenience,â€ he said, â€œthough I am not ignorant
that even the lady could brave the night-air on foot or on horseback,
were the errand more to her mind.â€

Andrew wrung his hands.--â€œI only said that my master was surely speaking
to a ghaist in the library--and the villain Lancie to betray an auld
friend, that sang aff the same Psalm-book wiâ€™ him every Sabbath for
twenty years!â€

He was turned out of the house, together with Syddall, without being
allowed to conclude his lamentation. His expulsion, however, led to some
singular consequences. Resolving, according to his own story, to go down
for the night where Mother Simpson would give him a lodging for old
acquaintanceâ€™ sake, he had just got clear of the avenue, and into the old
wood, as it was called, though it was now used as a pasture-ground rather
than woodland, when he suddenly lighted on a drove of Scotch cattle,
which were lying there to repose themselves after the dayâ€™s journey. At
this Andrew was in no way surprised, it being the well-known custom of
his countrymen, who take care of those droves, to quarter themselves
after night upon the best unenclosed grass-ground they can find, and
depart before day-break to escape paying for their nightâ€™s lodgings. But
he was both surprised and startled, when a Highlander, springing up,
accused him of disturbing the cattle, and refused him to pass forward
till he had spoken to his master. The mountaineer conducted Andrew into a
thicket, where he found three or four more of his countrymen. â€œAnd,â€ said
Andrew, â€œI saw sune they were ower mony men for the drove; and from the
questions they put to me, I judged they had other tow on their rock.â€

They questioned him closely about all that had passed at Osbaldistone
Hall, and seemed surprised and concerned at the report he made to them.

â€œAnd troth,â€ said Andrew, â€œI tauld them aâ€™ I kenâ€™d; for dirks and pistols
were what I could never refuse information to in aâ€™ my life.â€

They talked in whispers among themselves, and at length collected their
cattle together, and drove them close up to the entrance of the avenue,
which might be half a mile distant from the house. They proceeded to drag
together some felled trees which lay in the vicinity, so as to make a
temporary barricade across the road, about fifteen yards beyond the
avenue. It was now near daybreak, and there was a pale eastern gleam
mingled with the fading moonlight, so that objects could be discovered
with some distinctness. The lumbering sound of a coach drawn by four
horses, and escorted by six men on horseback, was heard coming up the
avenue. The Highlanders listened attentively. The carriage contained Mr.
Jobson and his unfortunate prisoners. The escort consisted of Rashleigh,
and of several horsemen, peace-officers and their assistants. So soon as
we had passed the gate at the head of the avenue, it was shut behind the
cavalcade by a Highland-man, stationed there for that purpose. At the
same time the carriage was impeded in its farther progress by the cattle,
amongst which we were involved, and by the barricade in front. Two of the
escort dismounted to remove the felled trees, which they might think were
left there by accident or carelessness. The others began with their whips
to drive the cattle from the road.

â€œWho dare abuse our cattle?â€ said a rough voice.--â€œShoot him, Angus!â€

Rashleigh instantly called out--â€œA rescue! a rescue!â€ and, firing a
pistol, wounded the man who spoke.

â€œ_Claymore!_â€ cried the leader of the Highlanders, and a scuffle
instantly commenced. The officers of the law, surprised at so sudden an
attack, and not usually possessing the most desperate bravery, made but
an imperfect defence, considering the superiority of their numbers. Some
attempted to ride back to the Hall, but on a pistol being fired from
behind the gate, they conceived themselves surrounded, and at length
galloped of in different directions. Rashleigh, meanwhile, had
dismounted, and on foot had maintained a desperate and single-handed
conflict with the leader of the band. The window of the carriage, on my
side, permitted me to witness it. At length Rashleigh dropped.

â€œWill you ask forgiveness for the sake of God, King James, and auld
friendship?â€ said a voice which I knew right well.

â€œNo, never!â€ said Rashleigh, firmly.

â€œThen, traitor, die in your treason!â€ retorted MacGregor, and plunged his
sword in his prostrate antagonist.

In the next moment he was at the carriage door--handed out Miss Vernon,
assisted her father and me to alight, and dragging out the attorney, head
foremost, threw him under the wheel.

â€œMr. Osbaldistone,â€ he said, in a whisper, â€œyou have nothing to
fear--I must look after those who have--Your friends will soon be in
safety--Farewell, and forget not the MacGregor.â€

He whistled--his band gathered round him, and, hurrying Diana and her
father along with him, they were almost instantly lost in the glades of
the forest. The coachman and postilion had abandoned their horses, and
fled at the first discharge of firearms; but the animals, stopped by the
barricade, remained perfectly still; and well for Jobson that they did
so, for the slightest motion would have dragged the wheel over his body.
My first object was to relieve him, for such was the rascalâ€™s terror that
he never could have risen by his own exertions. I next commanded him to
observe, that I had neither taken part in the rescue, nor availed myself
of it to make my escape, and enjoined him to go down to the Hall, and
call some of his party, who had been left there, to assist the wounded.--
But Jobsonâ€™s fears had so mastered and controlled every faculty of his
mind, that he was totally incapable of moving. I now resolved to go
myself, but in my way I stumbled over the body of a man, as I thought,
dead or dying. It was, however, Andrew Fairservice, as well and whole as
ever he was in his life, who had only taken this recumbent posture to
avoid the slashes, stabs, and pistol-balls, which for a moment or two
were flying in various directions. I was so glad to find him, that I did
not inquire how he came thither, but instantly commanded his assistance.

Rashleigh was our first object. He groaned when I approached him, as much
through spite as through pain, and shut his eyes, as if determined, like
Iago, to speak no word more. We lifted him into the carriage, and
performed the same good office to another wounded man of his party, who
had been left on the field. I then with difficulty made Jobson understand
that he must enter the coach also, and support Sir Rashleigh upon the
seat. He obeyed, but with an air as if he but half comprehended my
meaning. Andrew and I turned the horsesâ€™ heads round, and opening the
gate of the avenue, led them slowly back to Osbaldistone Hall.

Some fugitives had already reached the Hall by circuitous routes, and
alarmed its garrison by the news that Sir Rashleigh, Clerk Jobson, and
all their escort, save they who escaped to tell the tale, had been cut to
pieces at the head of the avenue by a whole regiment of wild Highlanders.
When we reached the mansion, therefore, we heard such a buzz as arises
when bees are alarmed, and mustering in their hives. Mr. Jobson, however,
who had now in some measure come to his senses, found voice enough to
make himself known. He was the more anxious to be released from the
carriage, as one of his companions (the peace-officer) had, to his
inexpressible terror, expired by his side with a hideous groan.

Sir Rashleigh Osbaldistone was still alive, but so dreadfully wounded
that the bottom of the coach was filled with his blood, and long traces
of it left from the entrance-door into the stone-hall, where he was
placed in a chair, some attempting to stop the bleeding with cloths,
while others called for a surgeon, and no one seemed willing to go to
fetch one. â€œTorment me not,â€ said the wounded man--â€œI know no assistance
can avail me--I am a dying man.â€ He raised himself in his chair, though
the damps and chill of death were already on his brow, and spoke with a
firmness which seemed beyond his strength. â€œCousin Francis,â€ he said,
â€œdraw near to me.â€ I approached him as he requested.--â€œI wish you only to
know that the pangs of death do not alter I one iota of my feelings
towards you. I hate you!â€ he said, the expression of rage throwing a
hideous glare into the eyes which were soon to be closed for ever--â€œI
hate you with a hatred as intense, now while I lie bleeding and dying
before you, as if my foot trode on your neck.â€

â€œI have given you no cause, sir,â€ I replied,--â€œand for your own sake I
could wish your mind in a better temper.â€

â€œYou _have_ given me cause,â€ he rejoined. â€œIn love, in ambition, in the
paths of interest, you have crossed and blighted me at every turn. I was
born to be the honour of my fatherâ€™s house--I have been its disgrace--and
all owing to you. My very patrimony has become yours--Take it,â€ he said,
â€œand may the curse of a dying man cleave to it!â€

In a moment after he had uttered this frightful wish, he fell back in the
chair; his eyes became glazed, his limbs stiffened, but the grin and
glare of mortal hatred survived even the last gasp of life. I will dwell
no longer on so painful a picture, nor say any more of the death of
Rashleigh, than that it gave me access to my rights of inheritance
without farther challenge, and that Jobson found himself compelled to
allow, that the ridiculous charge of misprision of high treason was got
up on an affidavit which he made with the sole purpose of favouring
Rashleighâ€™s views, and removing me from Osbaldistone Hall. The rascalâ€™s
name was struck off the list of attorneys, and he was reduced to poverty
and contempt.

I returned to London when I had put my affairs in order at Osbaldistone
Hall, and felt happy to escape from a place which suggested so many
painful recollections. My anxiety was now acute to learn the fate of
Diana and her father. A French gentleman who came to London on commercial
business, was intrusted with a letter to me from Miss Vernon, which put
my mind at rest respecting their safety.

It gave me to understand that the opportune appearance of MacGregor and
his party was not fortuitous. The Scottish nobles and gentry engaged in
the insurrection, as well as those of England, were particularly anxious
to further the escape of Sir Frederick Vernon, who, as an old and trusted
agent of the house of Stuart, was possessed of matter enough to have
ruined half Scotland. Rob Roy, of whose sagacity and courage they had
known so many proofs, was the person whom they pitched upon to assist his
escape, and the place of meeting was fixed at Osbaldistone Hall. You have
already heard how nearly the plan had been disconcerted by the unhappy
Rashleigh. It succeeded, however, perfectly; for when once Sir Frederick
and his daughter were again at large, they found horses prepared for
them, and, by MacGregorâ€™s knowledge of the country--for every part of
Scotland, and of the north of England, was familiar to him--were
conducted to the western sea-coast, and safely embarked for France. The
same gentleman told me that Sir Frederick was not expected to survive for
many months a lingering disease, the consequence of late hardships and
privations. His daughter was placed in a convent, and although it was her
fatherâ€™s wish she should take the veil, he was understood to refer the
matter entirely to her own inclinations.

When these news reached me, I frankly told the state of my affections to
my father, who was not a little startled at the idea of my marrying a
Roman Catholic. But he was very desirous to see me â€œsettled in life,â€ as
he called it; and he was sensible that, in joining him with heart and
hand in his commercial labours, I had sacrificed my own inclinations.
After a brief hesitation, and several questions asked and answered to his
satisfaction, he broke out with--â€œI little thought a son of mine should
have been Lord of Osbaldistone Manor, and far less that he should go to a
French convent for a spouse. But so dutiful a daughter cannot but prove a
good wife. You have worked at the desk to please me, Frank; it is but
fair you should wive to please yourself.â€

How I sped in my wooing, Will Tresham, I need not tell you. You know,
too, how long and happily I lived with Diana. You know how I lamented
her; but you do not--cannot know, how much she deserved her husbandâ€™s
sorrow.

I have no more of romantic adventure to tell, nor, indeed, anything to
communicate farther, since the latter incidents of my life are so well
known to one who has shared, with the most friendly sympathy, the joys,
as well as the sorrows, by which its scenes have been chequered. I often
visited Scotland, but never again saw the bold Highlander who had such an
influence on the early events of my life. I learned, however, from time
to time, that he continued to maintain his ground among the mountains of
Loch Lomond, in despite of his powerful enemies, and that he even
obtained, to a certain degree, the connivance of Government to his
self-elected office of protector of the Lennox, in virtue of which he
levied black-mail with as much regularity as the proprietors did their
ordinary rents. It seemed impossible that his life should have concluded
without a violent end. Nevertheless he died in old age and by a peaceful
death, some time about the year 1733, and is still remembered in his
country as the Robin Hood of Scotland--the dread of the wealthy, but the
friend of the poor--and possessed of many qualities, both of head and
heart, which would have graced a less equivocal profession than that to
which his fate condemned him.

Old Andrew Fairservice used to say, that â€œThere were many things ower bad
for blessing, and ower gude for banning, like Rob Roy.â€

_Here the original manuscript ends somewhat abruptly. I have reason to
think that what followed related to private a affairs._





POSTSCRIPT.

The second article of the Appendix to the Introduction to Rob Roy
contains two curious letters respecting the arrest of Mr. Grahame of
Killearn by that daring freebooter, while levying the Duke of Montroseâ€™s
rents. These were taken from scroll copies in the possession of his Grace
the present Duke, who kindly permitted the use of them in the present
publication.--The Novel had but just passed through the press, when the
Right Honourable Mr. Peel--whose important state avocations do not avert
his attention from the interests of literature--transmitted to the author
copies of the original letters and enclosure, of which he possessed only
the rough draught. The originals were discovered in the State Paper
Office, by the indefatigable researches of Mr. Lemon, who is daily
throwing more light on that valuable collection of records. From the
documents with which the Author has been thus kindly favoured, he is
enabled to fill up the addresses which were wanting in the scrolls. That
of the 21st Nov. 1716 is addressed to Lord Viscount Townshend, and is
accompanied by one of the same date to Robert Pringle, Esquire,
Under-Secretary of State, which is here inserted as relative to so
curious an incident:--

_Letter from the Duke of Montrose, to Robert Pringle, Esq.,
Under-Secretary to Lord Viscount Townshend._

â€œSr,_Glasgow,_ 21 _Nov._ 1716.

â€œHaveing had so many dispatches to make this night, I hope yeâ€™l excuse me
that I make use of another hand to give yow a short account of the
occasion of this express, by which I have written to my Ld. Duke of
Roxburgh, and my Lord Townshend, which I hope yeâ€™l gett carefully
deleivered.

â€œMr. Graham, younger of Killearn, being on Munday last in Menteith att a
country house, collecting my rents, was about nine oâ€™clock that same
night surprised by Rob Roy with a party of his men in arms, who haveing
surrounded the house and secured the avenues, presented their guns in at
the windows, while he himself entered the room with some others with cokt
pistolls, and seased Killearn with all his money, books, papers, and
bonds, and carryed all away with him to the hills, at the same time
ordering Killearn to write a letter to me (of which ye have the copy
inclosed), proposeing a very honourable treaty to me. I must say this
story was as surprising to me as it was insolent; and it must bring a
very great concern upon me, that this gentleman, my near relation, should
be brought to suffer all the barbaritys and crueltys, which revenge and
mallice may suggest to these miscreants, for his haveing acted a
faithfull part in the service of the Government, and his affection to me
in my concerns.

â€œI need not be more particular to you, since I know that my Letter to my
Lord Townshend will come into your hands, so shall only now give you the
assurances of my being, with great sincerity,

â€œSr, yr most humble servant,
(Signed)
â€œMontrose.â€

â€œI long exceedingly for a return of my former dispatches to the
Secretaryâ€™s about Methven and Colll Urquhart, and my wifeâ€™s cousins,
Balnamoon and Phinaven.

â€œI must beg yowâ€™ll give my humble service to Mr. Secretary Methven, and
tell him that I must refer him to what I have written to My Lord
Townshend in this affair of Rob Roy, believing it was needless to trouble
both with letters.â€

Examined,
Robt. Lemon,
_Deputy Keeper of State Papers._




STATE PAPER OFFICE,
_Nov._ 4, 1829

Note.--The enclosure referred to in the preceding letter is another copy
of the letter which Mr. Grahame of Killearn was compelled by Rob Roy to
write to the Duke of Montrose, and is exactly the same as the one
enclosed in his Graceâ€™s letter to Lord Townshend, dated November 21st,
1716.
R. L.


The last letter in the Appendix No. II. (28th November), acquainting the
Government with Killearnâ€™s being set at liberty, is also addressed to the
Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Pringle.

The Author may also here remark, that immediately previous to the
insurrection of 1715, he perceives, from some notes of information given
to Government, that Rob Roy appears to have been much employed and
trusted by the Jacobite party, even in the very delicate task of
transporting specie to the Earl of Breadalbane, though it might have
somewhat resembled trusting Don Raphael and Ambrose de Lamela with the
church treasure.





NOTES TO ROB ROY.




Note A.--The Grey Stone of MacGregor.

I have been informed that, at no very remote period, it was proposed to
take this large stone, which marks the grave of Dugald Ciar Mhor, and
convert it to the purpose of the lintel of a window, the threshold of a
door, or some such mean use. A man of the clan MacGregor, who was
somewhat deranged, took fire at this insult; and when the workmen came to
remove the stone, planted himself upon it, with a broad axe in his hand,
swearing he would dash out the brains of any one who should disturb the
monument. Athletic in person, and insane enough to be totally regardless
of consequences, it was thought best to give way to his humour; and the
poor madman kept sentinel on the stone day and night, till the proposal
of removing it was entirely dropped.




Note B.--Dugald Ciar Mhor.

The above is the account which I find in a manuscript history of the clan
MacGregor, of which I was indulged with a perusal by Donald MacGregor,
Esq., late Major of the 33d regiment, where great pains have been taken
to collect traditions and written documents concerning the family. But an
ancient and constant tradition, preserved among the inhabitants of the
country, and particularly those of the clan MacFarlane, relieves Dugald
Ciar Mhor of the guilt of murdering the youths, and lays the blame on a
certain Donald or Duncan Lean, who performed the act of cruelty, with the
assistance of a gillie who attended him, named Charlioch, or Charlie.
They say that the homicides dared not again join their clan, but that
they resided in a wild and solitary state as outlaws, in an unfrequented
part of the MacFarlanesâ€™ territory. Here they lived for some time
undisturbed, till they committed an act of brutal violence on two
defenceless women, a mother and daughter of the MacFarlane clan. In
revenge of this atrocity, the MacFarlanes hunted them down, and shot
them. It is said that the younger ruffian, Charlioch, might have escaped,
being remarkably swift of foot. But his crime became his punishment, for
the female whom he had outraged had defended herself desperately, and had
stabbed him with his own dirk in the thigh. He was lame from the wound,
and was the more easily overtaken and killed.

I always inclined to think this last the true edition of the story, and
that the guilt was transferred to Dugald Ciar Mhor, as a man of higher
name, but I have learned that Dugald was in truth dead several years
before the battle--my authority being his representative, Mr. Gregorson
of Ardtornish. [See also note to introduction, â€œLegend of Montrose,â€ vol.
vi.]




Note C.--The Loch Lomond Expedition.

The Loch Lomond expedition was judged worthy to form a separate pamphlet,
which I have not seen; but, as quoted by the historian Rae, it must be
delectable.

â€œOn the morrow, being Thursday the 13th, they went on their expedition,
and about noon came to Inversnaid, the place of danger, where the Paisley
men and those of Dumbarton, and several of the other companies, to the
number of an hundred men, with the greatest intrepidity leapt on shore,
got up to the top of the mountains, and stood a considerable time,
beating their drums all the while; but no enemy appearing, they went in
quest of their boats, which the rebels had seized, and having casually
lighted on some ropes and oars hid among the shrubs, at length they found
the boats drawn up a good way on the land, which they hurled down to the
loch. Such of them as were not damaged they carried off with them, and
such as were, they sank and hewed to pieces. That same night they
returned to Luss, and thence next day to Dumbarton, from whence they had
at first set out, bringing along with them the whole boats they found in
their way on either side of the loch, and in the creeks of the isles, and
mooring them under the cannon of the castle. During this expedition, the
pinnaces discharging their patararoes, and the men their small-arms, made
such a thundering noise, through the multiplied rebounding echoes of the
vast mountains on both sides of the loch, that the MacGregors were cowed
and frighted away to the rest of the rebels who were encamped at Strath
Fillan.â€--_Raeâ€™s History of the Rebellion,_ 4to, p. 287.




Note D.--Authorâ€™s Expedition against the MacLarens.

The Author is uncertain whether it is worth while to mention, that he had
a personal opportunity of observing, even in his own time, that the
kingâ€™s writ did not pass quite current in the Brass of Balquhidder. There
were very considerable debts due by Stewart of Appin (chiefly to the
authorâ€™s family), which were likely to be lost to the creditors, if they
could not be made available out of this same farm of Invernenty, the
scene of the murder done upon MacLaren.

His family, consisting of several strapping deer-stalkers, still
possessed the farm, by virtue of a long lease, for a trifling rent. There
was no chance of any one buying it with such an encumbrance, and a
transaction was entered into by the MacLarens, who, being desirous to
emigrate to America, agreed to sell their lease to the creditors for
L500, and to remove at the next term of Whitsunday. But whether they
repented their bargain, or desired to make a better, or whether from a
mere point of honour, the MacLarens declared they would not permit a
summons of removal to be executed against them, which was necessary for
the legal completion of the bargain. And such was the general impression
that they were men capable of resisting the legal execution of warning by
very effectual means, no kingâ€™s messenger would execute the summons
without the support of a military force. An escort of a sergeant and six
men was obtained from a Highland regiment lying in Stirling; and the
Author, then a writerâ€™s apprentice, equivalent to the honourable
situation of an attorneyâ€™s clerk, was invested with the superintendence
of the expedition, with directions to see that the messenger discharged
his duty fully, and that the gallant sergeant did not exceed his part by
committing violence or plunder. And thus it happened, oddly enough, that
the Author first entered the romantic scenery of Loch Katrine, of which
he may perhaps say he has somewhat extended the reputation, riding in all
the dignity of danger, with a front and rear guard, and loaded arms. The
sergeant was absolutely a Highland Sergeant Kite, full of stories of Rob
Roy and of himself, and a very good companion. We experienced no
interruption whatever, and when we came to Invernenty, found the house
deserted. We took up our quarters for the night, and used some of the
victuals which we found there. On the morning we returned as unmolested
as we came.

The MacLarens, who probably never thought of any serious opposition,
received their money and went to America, where, having had some slight
share in removing them from their _paupera regna,_ I sincerely hope they
prospered.

The rent of Invernenty instantly rose from L10 to L70 or L80; and when
sold, the farm was purchased (I think by the late Laird of MacNab) at a
price higher in proportion than what even the modern rent authorised the
parties interested to hope for.




Note E.--Allan Breck Stewart.

Allan Breck Stewart was a man likely in such a matter to keep his word.
James Drummond MacGregor and he, like Katherine and Petruchio, were well
matched â€œfor a couple of quiet ones.â€ Allan Breck lived till the
beginning of the French Revolution. About 1789, a friend of mine, then
residing at Paris, was invited to see some procession which was supposed
likely to interest him, from the windows of an apartment occupied by a
Scottish Benedictine priest. He found, sitting by the fire, a tall, thin,
raw-boned, grim-looking, old man, with the petit croix of St. Louis. His
visage was strongly marked by the irregular projections of the
cheek-bones and chin. His eyes were grey. His grizzled hair exhibited
marks of having been red, and his complexion was weather-beaten, and
remarkably freckled. Some civilities in French passed between the old man
and my friend, in the course of which they talked of the streets and
squares of Paris, till at length the old soldier, for such he seemed, and
such he was, said with a sigh, in a sharp Highland accent, â€œDeil ane oâ€™
them aâ€™ is worth the Hie Street of Edinburgh!â€ On inquiry, this admirer
of Auld Reekie, which he was never to see again, proved to be Allan Breck
Stewart. He lived decently on his little pension, and had, in no
subsequent period of his life, shown anything of the savage mood in which
he is generally believed to have assassinated the enemy and oppressor, as
he supposed him, of his family and clan.




Note F.--The Abbess of Wilton.

The nunnery of Wilton was granted to the Earl of Pembroke upon its
dissolution, by the magisterial authority of Henry VIII., or his son
Edward VI. On the accession of Queen Mary, of Catholic memory, the Earl
found it necessary to reinstate the Abbess and her fair recluses, which
he did with many expressions of his remorse, kneeling humbly to the
vestals, and inducting them into the convent and possessions from which
he had expelled them. With the accession of Elizabeth, the accommodating
Earl again resumed his Protestant faith, and a second time drove the nuns
from their sanctuary. The remonstrances of the Abbess, who reminded him
of his penitent expressions on the former occasion, could wring from him
no other answer than that in the text--â€œGo spin, you jade!--Go spin!â€




Note G.--Mons Meg.

Mons Meg was a large old-fashioned piece of ordnance, a great favourite
with the Scottish common people; she was fabricated at Mons, in Flanders,
in the reign of James IV. or V. of Scotland. This gun figures frequently
in the public accounts of the time, where we find charges for grease, to
grease Megâ€™s mouth withal (to increase, as every schoolboy knows, the
loudness of the report), ribands to deck her carriage, and pipes to play
before her when she was brought from the Castle to accompany the Scottish
army on any distant expedition. After the Union, there was much popular
apprehension that the Regalia of Scotland, and the subordinate Palladium,
Mons Meg, would be carried to England to complete the odious surrender of
national independence. The Regalia, sequestered from the sight of the
public, were generally supposed to have been abstracted in this manner.
As for Mons Meg, she remained in the Castle of Edinburgh, till, by order
of the Board of Ordnance, she was actually removed to Woolwich about
1757. The Regalia, by his Majestyâ€™s special command, have been brought
forth from their place of concealment in 1818, and exposed to the view of
the people, by whom they must be looked upon with deep associations; and,
in this very winter of 1828-9, Mons Meg has been restored to the country,
where that, which in every other place or situation was a mere mass of
rusty iron, becomes once more a curious monument of antiquity.




Note H.---Fairy Superstition.

The lakes and precipices amidst which the Avon-Dhu, or River Forth, has
its birth, are still, according to popular tradition, haunted by the
Elfin people, the most peculiar, but most pleasing, of the creations of
Celtic superstitions. The opinions entertained about these beings are
much the same with those of the Irish, so exquisitely well narrated by
Mr. Crofton Croker. An eminently beautiful little conical hill, near the
eastern extremity of the valley of Aberfoil, is supposed to be one of
their peculiar haunts, and is the scene which awakens, in Andrew
Fairservice, the terror of their power. It is remarkable, that two
successive clergymen of this parish of Aberfoil have employed themselves
in writing about this fairy superstition. The eldest of these was Robert
Kirke, a man of some talents, who translated the Psalms into Gaelic
verse. He had formerly been minister at the neighbouring parish of
Balquhidder, and died at Aberfoil in 1688, at the early age of forty-two.

He was author of the Secret Commonwealth, which was printed after his
death in 1691--(an edition which I have never seen)--and was reprinted in
Edinburgh, 1815. This is a work concerning the fairy people, in whose
existence Mr. Kirke appears to have been a devout believer. He describes
them with the usual powers and qualities ascribed to such beings in
Highland tradition.

But what is sufficiently singular, the Rev. Robert Kirke, author of the
said treatise, is believed himself to have been taken away by the
fairies,--in revenge, perhaps, for having let in too much light upon the
secrets of their commonwealth. We learn this catastrophe from the
information of his successor, the late amiable and learned Dr. Patrick
Grahame, also minister at Aberfoil, who, in his Sketches of Perthshire,
has not forgotten to touch upon the _Daoine Schie,_ or men of peace.

The Rev. Robert Kirke was, it seems, walking upon a little eminence to
the west of the present manse, which is still held a _Dun Shie,_ or fairy
mound, when he sunk down, in what seemed to mortals a fit, and was
supposed to be dead. This, however, was not his real fate.

â€œMr. Kirke was the near relation of Graham of Duchray, the ancestor of
the present General Graham Stirling. Shortly after his funeral, he
appeared, in the dress in which he had sunk down, to a medical relation
of his own, and of Duchray. â€˜Go,â€™ said he to him, â€˜to my cousin Duchray,
and tell him that I am not dead. I fell down in a swoon, and was carried
into Fairyland, where I now am. Tell him, that when he and my friends are
assembled at the baptism of my child (for he had left his wife pregnant),
I will appear in the room, and that if he throws the knife which he holds
in his hand over my head, I will be released and restored to human
society.â€™ The man, it seems, neglected, for some time, to deliver the
message. Mr. Kirke appeared to him a second time, threatening to haunt
him night and day till he executed his commission, which at length he
did. The time of the baptism arrived. They were seated at table; the
figure of Mr. Kirke entered, but the Laird of Duchray, by some
unaccountable fatality, neglected to perform the prescribed ceremony. Mr.
Kirke retired by another door, and was seen no wore. It is firmly
believed that he is, at this day, in Fairyland.â€--(_Sketches of
Perthshire,_ p. 254.)

Note I.--Clachan of Aberfoil.

I do not know how this might stand in Mr. Osbaldistoneâ€™s day, but I can
assure the reader, whose curiosity may lead him to visit the scenes of
these romantic adventures, that the Clachan of Aberfoil now affords a
very comfortable little inn. If he chances to be a Scottish antiquary, it
will be an additional recommendation to him, that he will find himself in
the vicinity of the Rev. Dr. Patrick Grahame, minister of the gospel at
Aberfoil, whose urbanity in communicating information on the subject of
national antiquities, is scarce exceeded even by the stores of legendary
lore which he has accumulated.--_Original Note._ The respectable
clergyman alluded to has been dead for some years. [See note H.]

The Chase.



     Harp of the North! that mouldering long hast hung
        On the witch-elm that shades Saint Fillan's spring
     And down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung,
        Till envious ivy did around thee cling,
     Muffling with verdant ringlet every string,--
        O Minstrel Harp, still must thine accents sleep?
     Mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring,
        Still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep,
     Nor bid a warrior smile, nor teach a maid to weep?

     Not thus, in ancient days of Caledon, [10]
        Was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd,
     When lay of hopeless love, or glory won,
        Aroused the fearful or subdued the proud.
     At each according pause was heard aloud
        Thine ardent symphony sublime and high!
     Fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed;
        For still the burden of thy minstrelsy
     Was Knighthood's dauntless deed, and Beauty's matchless eye.

     O, wake once more! how rude soe'er the hand
        That ventures o'er thy magic maze to stray;
     O, wake once more! though scarce my skill command
        Some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay:
     Though harsh and faint, and soon to die away,
        And all unworthy of thy nobler strain,
     Yet if one heart throb higher at its sway,
        The wizard note has not been touched in vain.
     Then silent be no more! Enchantress, wake again!


     I.

     The stag at eve had drunk his fill,
     Where danced the moon on Monan's rill,
     And deep his midnight lair had made
     In lone Glenartney's hazel shade;
     But when the sun his beacon red
     Had kindled on Benvoirlich's head,
     The deep-mouthed bloodhound's heavy bay
     Resounded up the rocky way,
     And faint, from farther distance borne,
     Were heard the clanging hoof and horn.


     II.

     As Chief, who hears his warder call,
     'To arms! the foemen storm the wall,'
     The antlered monarch of the waste
     Sprung from his heathery couch in haste.
     But ere his fleet career he took,
     The dew-drops from his flanks he shook;
     Like crested leader proud and high
     Tossed his beamed frontlet to the sky;
     A moment gazed adown the dale,
     A moment snuffed the tainted gale,
     A moment listened to the cry,
     That thickened as the chase drew nigh;
     Then, as the headmost foes appeared,
     With one brave bound the copse he cleared,
     And, stretching forward free and far,
     Sought the wild heaths of Uam-Var.


     III.

     Yelled on the view the opening pack;
     Rock, glen, and cavern paid them back;
     To many a mingled sound at once
     The awakened mountain gave response.
     A hundred dogs bayed deep and strong,
     Clattered a hundred steeds along,
     Their peal the merry horns rung out,
     A hundred voices joined the shout;
     With hark and whoop and wild halloo,
     No rest Benvoirlich's echoes knew.
     Far from the tumult fled the roe,
     Close in her covert cowered the doe,
     The falcon, from her cairn on high,
     Cast on the rout a wondering eye,
     Till far beyond her piercing ken
     The hurricane had swept the glen.
     Faint, and more faint, its failing din
     Returned from cavern, cliff, and linn,
     And silence settled, wide and still,
     On the lone wood and mighty hill.


     IV.

     Less loud the sounds of sylvan war
     Disturbed the heights of Uam-Var,
     And roused the cavern where, 't is told,
     A giant made his den of old;
     For ere that steep ascent was won,
     High in his pathway hung the sun,
     And many a gallant, stayed perforce,
     Was fain to breathe his faltering horse,
     And of the trackers of the deer
     Scarce half the lessening pack was near;
     So shrewdly on the mountain-side
     Had the bold burst their mettle tried.


     V.

     The noble stag was pausing now
     Upon the mountain's southern brow,
     Where broad extended, far beneath,
     The varied realms of fair Menteith.
     With anxious eye he wandered o'er
     Mountain and meadow, moss and moor,
     And pondered refuge from his toil,
     By far Lochard or Aberfoyle.
     But nearer was the copsewood gray
     That waved and wept on Loch Achray,
     And mingled with the pine-trees blue
     On the bold cliffs of Benvenue.
     Fresh vigor with the hope returned,
     With flying foot the heath he spurned,
     Held westward with unwearied race,
     And left behind the panting chase.


     VI.

     'T were long to tell what steeds gave o'er,
     As swept the hunt through Cambusmore;
     What reins were tightened in despair,
     When rose Benledi's ridge in air;
     Who flagged upon Bochastle's heath,
     Who shunned to stem the flooded Teith,--
     For twice that day, from shore to shore,
     The gallant stag swam stoutly o'er.
     Few were the stragglers, following far,
     That reached the lake of Vennachar;
     And when the Brigg of Turk was won,
     The headmost horseman rode alone.


     VII.

     Alone, but with unbated zeal,
     That horseman plied the scourge and steel;
     For jaded now, and spent with toil,
     Embossed with foam, and dark with soil,
     While every gasp with sobs he drew,
     The laboring stag strained full in view.
     Two dogs of black Saint Hubert's breed,
     Unmatched for courage, breath, and speed,
     Fast on his flying traces came,
     And all but won that desperate game;
     For, scarce a spear's length from his haunch,
     Vindictive toiled the bloodhounds stanch;
     Nor nearer might the dogs attain,
     Nor farther might the quarry strain
     Thus up the margin of the lake,
     Between the precipice and brake,
     O'er stock and rock their race they take.


     VIII.

     The Hunter marked that mountain high,
     The lone lake's western boundary,
     And deemed the stag must turn to bay,
     Where that huge rampart barred the way;
     Already glorying in the prize,
     Measured his antlers with his eyes;
     For the death-wound and death-halloo
     Mustered his breath, his whinyard drew:--
     But thundering as he came prepared,
     With ready arm and weapon bared,
     The wily quarry shunned the shock,
     And turned him from the opposing rock;
     Then, dashing down a darksome glen,
     Soon lost to hound and Hunter's ken,
     In the deep Trosachs' wildest nook
     His solitary refuge took.
     There, while close couched the thicket shed
     Cold dews and wild flowers on his head,
     He heard the baffled dogs in vain
     Rave through the hollow pass amain,
     Chiding the rocks that yelled again.


     IX.

     Close on the hounds the Hunter came,
     To cheer them on the vanished game;
     But, stumbling in the rugged dell,
     The gallant horse exhausted fell.
     The impatient rider strove in vain
      To rouse him with the spur and rein,
     For the good steed, his labors o'er,
     Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more;
     Then, touched with pity and remorse,
     He sorrowed o'er the expiring horse.
     'I little thought, when first thy rein
     I slacked upon the banks of Seine,
     That Highland eagle e'er should feed
     On thy fleet limbs, my matchless steed!
     Woe worth the chase, woe worth the day,
     That costs thy life, my gallant gray!'


     X.

     Then through the dell his horn resounds,
     From vain pursuit to call the hounds.
     Back limped, with slow and crippled pace,
     The sulky leaders of the chase;
     Close to their master's side they pressed,
     With drooping tail and humbled crest;
     But still the dingle's hollow throat
     Prolonged the swelling bugle-note.
     The owlets started from their dream,
     The eagles answered with their scream,
     Round and around the sounds were cast,
     Till echo seemed an answering blast;
     And on the Hunter tried his way,
     To join some comrades of the day,
     Yet often paused, so strange the road,
     So wondrous were the scenes it showed.


     XI.

     The western waves of ebbing day
     Rolled o'er the glen their level way;
     Each purple peak, each flinty spire,
     Was bathed in floods of living fire.
     But not a setting beam could glow
     Within the dark ravines below,
     Where twined the path in shadow hid,
     Round many a rocky pyramid,
     Shooting abruptly from the dell
     Its thunder-splintered pinnacle;
     Round many an insulated mass,
     The native bulwarks of the pass,
     Huge as the tower which builders vain
     Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain.
     The rocky summits, split and rent,
     Formed turret, dome, or battlement.
     Or seemed fantastically set
     With cupola or minaret,
     Wild crests as pagod ever decked,
     Or mosque of Eastern architect.
     Nor were these earth-born castles bare,
     Nor lacked they many a banner fair;
     For, from their shivered brows displayed,
     Far o'er the unfathomable glade,
     All twinkling with the dewdrop sheen,
     The briar-rose fell in streamers green,
     kind creeping shrubs of thousand dyes
     Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs.


     XII.

     Boon nature scattered, free and wild,
     Each plant or flower, the mountain's child.
     Here eglantine embalmed the air,
     Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;
     The primrose pale and violet flower
     Found in each cliff a narrow bower;
     Foxglove and nightshade, side by side,
     Emblems of punishment and pride,
     Grouped their dark hues with every stain
     The weather-beaten crags retain.
     With boughs that quaked at every breath,
     Gray birch and aspen wept beneath;
     Aloft, the ash and warrior oak
     Cast anchor in the rifted rock;
     And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung
     His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,
     Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,
     His boughs athwart the narrowed sky.
     Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,
     Where glistening streamers waved and danced,
     The wanderer's eye could barely view
     The summer heaven's delicious blue;
     So wondrous wild, the whole might seem
     The scenery of a fairy dream.


     XIII.

     Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep
     A narrow inlet, still and deep,
     Affording scarce such breadth of brim
     As served the wild duck's brood to swim.
     Lost for a space, through thickets veering,
     But broader when again appearing,
     Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face
     Could on the dark-blue mirror trace;
     And farther as the Hunter strayed,
     Still broader sweep its channels made.
     The shaggy mounds no longer stood,
     Emerging from entangled wood,
     But, wave-encircled, seemed to float,
     Like castle girdled with its moat;
     Yet broader floods extending still
     Divide them from their parent hill,
     Till each, retiring, claims to be
     An islet in an inland sea.


     XIV.

     And now, to issue from the glen,
     No pathway meets the wanderer's ken,
     Unless he climb with footing nice
     A far-projecting precipice.
     The broom's tough roots his ladder made,
     The hazel saplings lent their aid;
     And thus an airy point he won,
     Where, gleaming with the setting sun,
     One burnished sheet of living gold,
     Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,
     In all her length far winding lay,
     With promontory, creek, and bay,
     And islands that, empurpled bright,
     Floated amid the livelier light,
     And mountains that like giants stand
     To sentinel enchanted land.
     High on the south, huge Benvenue
     Down to the lake in masses threw
     Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled,
     The fragments of an earlier world;
     A wildering forest feathered o'er
     His ruined sides and summit hoar,
     While on the north, through middle air,
     Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare.


     XV.

     From the steep promontory gazed
     The stranger, raptured and amazed,
     And, 'What a scene were here,' he cried,
     'For princely pomp or churchman's pride!
     On this bold brow, a lordly tower;
     In that soft vale, a lady's bower;
     On yonder meadow far away,
     The turrets of a cloister gray;
     How blithely might the bugle-horn
     Chide on the lake the lingering morn!
     How sweet at eve the lover's lute
     Chime when the groves were still and mute!
     And when the midnight moon should lave
     Her forehead in the silver wave,
     How solemn on the ear would come
     The holy matins' distant hum,
     While the deep peal's commanding tone
     Should wake, in yonder islet lone,
     A sainted hermit from his cell,
     To drop a bead with every knell!
     And bugle, lute, and bell, and all,
     Should each bewildered stranger call
     To friendly feast and lighted hall.


     XVI.

     'Blithe were it then to wander here!
     But now--beshrew yon nimble deer--
     Like that same hermit's, thin and spare,
     The copse must give my evening fare;
     Some mossy bank my couch must be,
     Some rustling oak my canopy.
     Yet pass we that; the war and chase
     Give little choice of resting-place;--
     A summer night in greenwood spent
     Were but to-morrow's merriment:
     But hosts may in these wilds abound,
     Such as are better missed than found;
     To meet with Highland plunderers here
     Were worse than loss of steed or deer.--
     I am alone;--my bugle-strain
     May call some straggler of the train;
     Or, fall the worst that may betide,
     Ere now this falchion has been tried.'


     XVII.

     But scarce again his horn he wound,
     When lo! forth starting at the sound,
     From underneath an aged oak
     That slanted from the islet rock,
     A damsel guider of its way,
     A little skiff shot to the bay,
     That round the promontory steep
     Led its deep line in graceful sweep,
     Eddying, in almost viewless wave,
     The weeping willow twig to rave,
     And kiss, with whispering sound and slow,
     The beach of pebbles bright as snow.
      The boat had touched this silver strand
     Just as the Hunter left his stand,
     And stood concealed amid the brake,
     To view this Lady of the Lake.
      The maiden paused, as if again
     She thought to catch the distant strain.
     With head upraised, and look intent,
     And eye and ear attentive bent,
     And locks flung back, and lips apart,
     Like monument of Grecian art,
     In listening mood, she seemed to stand,
     The guardian Naiad of the strand.


     XVIII.

     And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace
     A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace,
     Of finer form or lovelier face!
     What though the sun, with ardent frown,
     Had slightly tinged her cheek with brown,--
     The sportive toil, which, short and light
     Had dyed her glowing hue so bright,
     Served too in hastier swell to show
     Short glimpses of a breast of snow:
     What though no rule of courtly grace
     To measured mood had trained her pace,--
     A foot more light, a step more true,
     Ne'er from the heath-flower dashed the dew;
     E'en the slight harebell raised its head,
     Elastic from her airy tread:
     What though upon her speech there hung
      The accents of the mountain tongue,---
     Those silver sounds, so soft, so dear,
     The listener held his breath to hear!


     XIX.

     A chieftain's daughter seemed the maid;
     Her satin snood, her silken plaid,
     Her golden brooch, such birth betrayed.
     And seldom was a snood amid
     Such wild luxuriant ringlets hid,
     Whose glossy black to shame might bring
     The plumage of the raven's wing;
     And seldom o'er a breast so fair
     Mantled a plaid with modest care,
     And never brooch the folds combined
     Above a heart more good and kind.
     Her kindness and her worth to spy,
     You need but gaze on Ellen's eye;
      Not Katrine in her mirror blue
     Gives back the shaggy banks more true,
     Than every free-born glance confessed
     The guileless movements of her breast;
     Whether joy danced in her dark eye,
     Or woe or pity claimed a sigh,
     Or filial love was glowing there,
     Or meek devotion poured a prayer,
     Or tale of injury called forth
     The indignant spirit of the North.
     One only passion unrevealed
     With maiden pride the maid concealed,
     Yet not less purely felt the flame;--
     O, need I tell that passion's name?


     XX.

     Impatient of the silent horn,
     Now on the gale her voice was borne:--
     'Father!' she cried; the rocks around
     Loved to prolong the gentle sound.
     Awhile she paused, no answer came;--
     'Malcolm, was thine the blast?' the name
     Less resolutely uttered fell,
     The echoes could not catch the swell.
     'A stranger I,' the Huntsman said,
     Advancing from the hazel shade.
     The maid, alarmed, with hasty oar
     Pushed her light shallop from the shore,
     And when a space was gained between,
     Closer she drew her bosom's screen;--
     So forth the startled swan would swing,
     So turn to prune his ruffled wing.
     Then safe, though fluttered and amazed,
     She paused, and on the stranger gazed.
     Not his the form, nor his the eye,
     That youthful maidens wont to fly.


     XXI.

     On his bold visage middle age
     Had slightly pressed its signet sage,
     Yet had not quenched the open truth
     And fiery vehemence of youth;
     Forward and frolic glee was there,
     The will to do, the soul to dare,
     The sparkling glance, soon blown to fire,
     Of hasty love or headlong ire.
     His limbs were cast in manly could
     For hardy sports or contest bold;
     And though in peaceful garb arrayed,
     And weaponless except his blade,
     His stately mien as well implied
     A high-born heart, a martial pride,
     As if a baron's crest he wore,
     And sheathed in armor bode the shore.
     Slighting the petty need he showed,
     He told of his benighted road;
     His ready speech flowed fair and free,
     In phrase of gentlest courtesy,
     Yet seemed that tone and gesture bland
     Less used to sue than to command.


     XXII.

     Awhile the maid the stranger eyed,
     And, reassured, at length replied,
     That Highland halls were open still
     To wildered wanderers of the hill.
     'Nor think you unexpected come
     To yon lone isle, our desert home;
     Before the heath had lost the dew,
     This morn, a couch was pulled for you;
     On yonder mountain's purple head
     Have ptarmigan and heath-cock bled,
     And our broad nets have swept the mere,
     To furnish forth your evening cheer.'--
     'Now, by the rood, my lovely maid,
     Your courtesy has erred,' he said;
     'No right have I to claim, misplaced,
     The welcome of expected guest.
     A wanderer, here by fortune toss,
     My way, my friends, my courser lost,
     I ne'er before, believe me, fair,
     Have ever drawn your mountain air,
     Till on this lake's romantic strand
     I found a fey in fairy land!'--


     XXIII.

     'I well believe,' the maid replied,
     As her light skiff approached the side,--
     'I well believe, that ne'er before
     Your foot has trod Loch Katrine's shore
     But yet, as far as yesternight,
     Old Allan-bane foretold your plight,--
     A gray-haired sire, whose eye intent
     Was on the visioned future bent.
     He saw your steed, a dappled gray,
     Lie dead beneath the birchen way;
     Painted exact your form and mien,
     Your hunting-suit of Lincoln green,
     That tasselled horn so gayly gilt,
     That falchion's crooked blade and hilt,
     That cap with heron plumage trim,
     And yon two hounds so dark and grim.
     He bade that all should ready be
     To grace a guest of fair degree;
     But light I held his prophecy,
     And deemed it was my father's horn
     Whose echoes o'er the lake were borne.'


     XXIV.

     The stranger smiled:--'Since to your home
     A destined errant-knight I come,
     Announced by prophet sooth and old,
     Doomed, doubtless, for achievement bold,
     I 'll lightly front each high emprise
     For one kind glance of those bright eyes.
     Permit me first the task to guide
     Your fairy frigate o'er the tide.'
     The maid, with smile suppressed and sly,
     The toil unwonted saw him try;
     For seldom, sure, if e'er before,
     His noble hand had grasped an oar:
     Yet with main strength his strokes he drew,
     And o'er the lake the shallop flew;
     With heads erect and whimpering cry,
     The hounds behind their passage ply.
     Nor frequent does the bright oar break
     The darkening mirror of the lake,
     Until the rocky isle they reach,
     And moor their shallop on the beach.


     XXV.

     The stranger viewed the shore around;
     'T was all so close with copsewood bound,
     Nor track nor pathway might declare
     That human foot frequented there,
     Until the mountain maiden showed
     A clambering unsuspected road,
     That winded through the tangled screen,
     And opened on a narrow green,
     Where weeping birch and willow round
     With their long fibres swept the ground.
     Here, for retreat in dangerous hour,
     Some chief had framed a rustic bower.


     XXVI.

     It was a lodge of ample size,
     But strange of structure and device;
     Of such materials as around
     The workman's hand had readiest found.
     Lopped of their boughs, their hoar trunks bared,
     And by the hatchet rudely squared,
     To give the walls their destined height,
     The sturdy oak and ash unite;
     While moss and clay and leaves combined
     To fence each crevice from the wind.
     The lighter pine-trees overhead
     Their slender length for rafters spread,
     And withered heath and rushes dry
     Supplied a russet canopy.
     Due westward, fronting to the green,
     A rural portico was seen,
     Aloft on native pillars borne,
     Of mountain fir with bark unshorn
     Where Ellen's hand had taught to twine
     The ivy and Idaean vine,
     The clematis, the favored flower
     Which boasts the name of virgin-bower,
     And every hardy plant could bear
     Loch Katrine's keen and searching air.
     An instant in this porch she stayed,
     And gayly to the stranger said:
     'On heaven and on thy lady call,
     And enter the enchanted hall!'


     XXVII.

     'My hope, my heaven, my trust must be,
     My gentle guide, in following thee!'--
      He crossed the threshold,--and a clang
     Of angry steel that instant rang.
     To his bold brow his spirit rushed,
     But soon for vain alarm he blushed
     When on the floor he saw displayed,
     Cause of the din, a naked blade
     Dropped from the sheath, that careless flung
     Upon a stag's huge antlers swung;
     For all around, the walls to grace,
     Hung trophies of the fight or chase:
     A target there, a bugle here,
     A battle-axe, a hunting-spear,
     And broadswords, bows, and arrows store,
     With the tusked trophies of the boar.
     Here grins the wolf as when he died,
     And there the wild-cat's brindled hide
     The frontlet of the elk adorns,
     Or mantles o'er the bison's horns;
     Pennons and flags defaced and stained,
     That blackening streaks of blood retained,
     And deer-skins, dappled, dun, and white,
     With otter's fur and seal's unite,
     In rude and uncouth tapestry all,
     To garnish forth the sylvan hall.


     XXVIII.

     The wondering stranger round him gazed,
     And next the fallen weapon raised:--
     Few were the arms whose sinewy strength
     Sufficed to stretch it forth at length.
     And as the brand he poised and swayed,
     'I never knew but one,' he said,
     'Whose stalwart arm might brook to wield
     A blade like this in battle-field.'
     She sighed, then smiled and took the word:
     'You see the guardian champion's sword;
     As light it trembles in his hand
     As in my grasp a hazel wand:
     My sire's tall form might grace the part
     Of Ferragus or Ascabart,
     But in the absent giant's hold
     Are women now, and menials old.'


     XXIX.

     The mistress of the mansion came,
     Mature of age, a graceful dame,
     Whose easy step and stately port
     Had well become a princely court,
     To whom, though more than kindred knew,
     Young Ellen gave a mother's due.
     Meet welcome to her guest she made,
     And every courteous rite was paid
     That hospitality could claim,
     Though all unasked his birth and name.
     Such then the reverence to a guest,
     That fellest foe might join the feast,
     And from his deadliest foeman's door
     Unquestioned turn the banquet o'er
     At length his rank the stranger names,
     'The Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James;
     Lord of a barren heritage,
     Which his brave sires, from age to age,
     By their good swords had held with toil;
     His sire had fallen in such turmoil,
     And he, God wot, was forced to stand
     Oft for his right with blade in hand.
     This morning with Lord Moray's train
     He chased a stalwart stag in vain,
     Outstripped his comrades, missed the deer,
     Lost his good steed, and wandered here.'


     XXX.

     Fain would the Knight in turn require
     The name and state of Ellen's sire.
     Well showed the elder lady's mien
     That courts and cities she had seen;
     Ellen, though more her looks displayed
     The simple grace of sylvan maid,
     In speech and gesture, form and face,
     Showed she was come of gentle race.
     'T were strange in ruder rank to find
     Such looks, such manners, and such mind.
     Each hint the Knight of Snowdoun gave,
     Dame Margaret heard with silence grave;
     Or Ellen, innocently gay,
     Turned all inquiry light away:--
     'Weird women we! by dale and down
     We dwell, afar from tower and town.
     We stem the flood, we ride the blast,
     On wandering knights our spells we cast;
     While viewless minstrels touch the string,
     'Tis thus our charmed rhymes we sing.'
     She sung, and still a harp unseen
     Filled up the symphony between.


     XXXI.

     Song.

     Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,
          Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking;
     Dream of battled fields no more,
          Days of danger, nights of waking.
     In our isle's enchanted hall,
          Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,
     Fairy strains of music fall,
          Every sense in slumber dewing.
     Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,
     Dream of fighting fields no more;
     Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
     Morn of toil, nor night of waking.

     'No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
          Armor's clang or war-steed champing
     Trump nor pibroch summon here
          Mustering clan or squadron tramping.
     Yet the lark's shrill fife may come
          At the daybreak from the fallow,
     And the bittern sound his drum
          Booming from the sedgy shallow.
     Ruder sounds shall none be near,
     Guards nor warders challenge here,
     Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing,
     Shouting clans or squadrons stamping.'


     XXXII.

     She paused,--then, blushing, led the lay,
     To grace the stranger of the day.
     Her mellow notes awhile  prolong
     The cadence of the flowing song,
     Till to her lips in measured frame
     The minstrel verse spontaneous came.

     Song Continued.

     'Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done;
          While our slumbrous spells assail ye,
     Dream not, with the rising sun,
          Bugles here shall sound reveille.
     Sleep! the deer is in his den;
          Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;
     Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen
     How thy gallant steed lay dying.
     Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done;
     Think not of the rising sun,
     For at dawning to assail ye
     Here no bugles sound reveille.'


     XXXIII.

     The hall was cleared,--the stranger's bed,
     Was there of mountain heather spread,
     Where oft a hundred guests had lain,
     And dreamed their forest sports again.
     But vainly did the heath-flower shed
     Its moorland fragrance round his head;
     Not Ellen's spell had lulled to rest
     The fever of his troubled breast.
     In broken dreams the image rose
     Of varied perils, pains, and woes:
      His steed now flounders in the brake,
     Now sinks his barge upon the lake;
     Now leader of a broken host,
     His standard falls, his honor's lost.
     Then,--from my couch may heavenly might
     Chase that worst phantom of the night!--
     Again returned the scenes of youth,
     Of confident, undoubting truth;
     Again his soul he interchanged
     With friends whose hearts were long estranged.
     They come, in dim procession led,
     The cold, the faithless, and the dead;
     As warm each hand, each brow as gay,
     As if they parted yesterday.
     And doubt distracts him at the view,--
     O were his senses false or true?
     Dreamed he of death or broken vow,
     Or is it all a vision now?


     XXXIV.

     At length, with Ellen in a grove
     He seemed to walk and speak of love;
     She listened with a blush and sigh,
     His suit was warm, his hopes were high.
     He sought her yielded hand to clasp,
     And a cold gauntlet met his grasp:
     The phantom's sex was changed and gone,
     Upon its head a helmet shone;
     Slowly enlarged to giant size,
     With darkened cheek and threatening eyes,
     The grisly visage, stern and hoar,
     To Ellen still a likeness bore.--
     He woke, and, panting with affright,
     Recalled the vision of the night.
     The hearth's decaying brands were red
     And deep and dusky lustre shed,
     Half showing, half concealing, all
     The uncouth trophies of the hall.
     Mid those the stranger fixed his eye
     Where that huge falchion hung on high,
     And thoughts on thoughts, a countless throng,
     Rushed, chasing countless thoughts along,
     Until, the giddy whirl to cure,
     He rose and sought the moonshine pure.


     XXXV.

     The wild rose, eglantine, and broom
     Wasted around their rich perfume;
     The birch-trees wept in fragrant balm;
     The aspens slept beneath the calm;
     The silver light, with quivering glance,
     Played on the water's still expanse,--
     Wild were the heart whose passion's sway
     Could rage beneath the sober ray!
     He felt its calm, that warrior guest,
     While thus he communed with his breast:--
     'Why is it, at each turn I trace
     Some memory of that exiled race?
     Can I not mountain maiden spy,
     But she must bear the Douglas eye?
     Can I not view a Highland brand,
     But it must match the Douglas hand?
     Can I not frame a fevered dream,
     But still the Douglas is the theme?
     I'll dream no more,--by manly mind
     Not even in sleep is will resigned.
     My midnight orisons said o'er,
     I'll turn to rest, and dream no more.'
     His midnight orisons he told,
     A prayer with every bead of gold,
     Consigned to heaven his cares and woes,
     And sunk in undisturbed repose,
     Until the heath-cock shrilly crew,
     And morning dawned on Benvenue.




CANTO SECOND.

The Island.


     I.

     At morn the black-cock trims his jetty wing,
          'T is morning prompts the linnet's blithest lay,
     All Nature's children feel the matin spring
          Of life reviving, with reviving day;
     And while yon little bark glides down the bay,
          Wafting the stranger on his way again,
     Morn's genial influence roused a minstrel gray,
          And sweetly o'er the lake was heard thy strain,
     Mixed with the sounding harp, O white-haired Allan-bane!


     II.

     Song.

     'Not faster yonder rowers' might
          Flings from their oars the spray,
     Not faster yonder rippling bright,
     That tracks the shallop's course in light,
          Melts in the lake away,
     Than men from memory erase
     The benefits of former days;
     Then, stranger, go! good speed the while,
     Nor think again of the lonely isle.

     'High place to thee in royal court,
          High place in battled line,
     Good hawk and hound for sylvan sport!
     Where beauty sees the brave resort,
          The honored meed be thine!
     True be thy sword, thy friend sincere,
     Thy lady constant, kind, and dear,
     And lost in love's and friendship's smile
     Be memory of the lonely isle!


     III.

     Song Continued.

     'But if beneath yon southern sky
          A plaided stranger roam,
     Whose drooping crest and stifled sigh,
     And sunken cheek and heavy eye,
          Pine for his Highland home;
     Then, warrior, then be thine to show
     The care that soothes a wanderer's woe;
     Remember then thy hap erewhile,
     A stranger in the lonely isle.

     'Or if on life's uncertain main
          Mishap shall mar thy sail;
     If faithful, wise, and brave in vain,
     Woe, want, and exile thou sustain
          Beneath the fickle gale;
     Waste not a sigh on fortune changed,
     On thankless courts, or friends estranged,
     But come where kindred worth shall smile,
     To greet thee in the lonely isle.'


     IV.

     As died the sounds upon the tide,
     The shallop reached the mainland side,
     And ere his onward way he took,
     The stranger cast a lingering look,
     Where easily his eye might reach
     The Harper on the islet beach,
     Reclined against a blighted tree,
     As wasted, gray, and worn as he.
     To minstrel meditation given,
     His reverend brow was raised to heaven,
     As from the rising sun to claim
     A sparkle of inspiring flame.
     His hand, reclined upon the wire,
     Seemed watching the awakening fire;
     So still he sat as those who wait
     Till judgment speak the doom of fate;
     So still, as if no breeze might dare
     To lift one lock of hoary hair;
     So still, as life itself were fled
     In the last sound his harp had sped.


     V.

     Upon a rock with lichens wild,
     Beside him Ellen sat and smiled.--
     Smiled she to see the stately drake
     Lead forth his fleet upon the lake,
     While her vexed spaniel from the beach
     Bayed at the prize beyond his reach?
     Yet tell me, then, the maid who knows,
     Why deepened on her cheek the rose?--
     Forgive, forgive, Fidelity!
     Perchance the maiden smiled to see
     Yon parting lingerer wave adieu,
     And stop and turn to wave anew;
     And, lovely ladies, ere your ire
     Condemn the heroine of my lyre,
     Show me the fair would scorn to spy
     And prize such conquest of her eve!


     VI.

     While yet he loitered on the spot,
     It seemed as Ellen marked him not;
     But when he turned him to the glade,
     One courteous parting sign she made;
     And after, oft the knight would say,
     That not when prize of festal day
     Was dealt him by the brightest fair
     Who e'er wore jewel in her hair,
     So highly did his bosom swell
     As at that simple mute farewell.
     Now with a trusty mountain-guide,
     And his dark stag-hounds by his side,
     He parts,--the maid, unconscious still,
     Watched him wind slowly round the hill;
     But when his stately form was hid,
     The guardian in her bosom chid,--
     'Thy Malcolm! vain and selfish maid!'
     'T was thus upbraiding conscience said,--
     'Not so had Malcolm idly hung
     On the smooth phrase of Southern tongue;
     Not so had Malcolm strained his eye
     Another step than thine to spy.'--
     'Wake, Allan-bane,' aloud she cried
     To the old minstrel by her side,--
     'Arouse thee from thy moody dream!
     I 'll give thy harp heroic theme,
     And warm thee with a noble name;
     Pour forth the glory of the Graeme!'
     Scarce from her lip the word had rushed,
     When deep the conscious maiden blushed;
     For of his clan, in hall and bower,
     Young Malcolm Graeme was held the flower.


     VII.

     The minstrel waked his harp,--three times
     Arose the well-known martial chimes,
     And thrice their high heroic pride
     In melancholy murmurs died.
      'Vainly thou bidst, O noble maid,'
     Clasping his withered hands, he said,
     'Vainly thou bidst me wake the strain,
      Though all unwont to bid in vain.
     Alas! than mine a mightier hand
     Has tuned my harp, my strings has spanned!
     I touch the chords of joy, but low
     And mournful answer notes of woe;
     And the proud march which victors tread
     Sinks in the wailing for the dead.
     O, well for me, if mine alone
     That dirge's deep prophetic tone!
     If, as my tuneful fathers said,
     This harp, which erst Saint Modan swayed,
     Can thus its master's fate foretell,
     Then welcome be the minstrel's knell.'


     VIII.

     'But ah! dear lady, thus it sighed,
     The eve thy sainted mother died;
     And such the sounds which, while I strove
     To wake a lay of war or love,
     Came marring all the festal mirth,
     Appalling me who gave them birth,
     And, disobedient to my call,
     Wailed loud through Bothwell's bannered hall.
     Ere Douglases, to ruin driven,
     Were exiled from their native heaven.--
     O! if yet worse mishap and woe
     My master's house must undergo,
     Or aught but weal to Ellen fair
     Brood in these accents of despair,
     No future bard, sad Harp! shall fling
     Triumph or rapture from thy string;
     One short, one final strain shall flow,
     Fraught with unutterable woe,
     Then shivered shall thy fragments lie,
     Thy master cast him down and die!'


     IX.

     Soothing she answered him: 'Assuage,
     Mine honored friend, the fears of age;
     All melodies to thee are known
     That harp has rung or pipe has blown,
     In Lowland vale or Highland glen,
     From Tweed to Spey--what marvel, then,
     At times unbidden notes should rise,
     Confusedly bound in memory's ties,
     Entangling, as they rush along,
     The war-march with the funeral song?--
     Small ground is now for boding fear;
     Obscure, but safe, we rest us here.
     My sire, in native virtue great,
     Resigning lordship, lands, and state,
     Not then to fortune more resigned
     Than yonder oak might give the wind;
     The graceful foliage storms may reeve,
     'Fine noble stem they cannot grieve.
     For me'--she stooped, and, looking round,
     Plucked a blue harebell from the ground,--
     'For me, whose memory scarce conveys
     An image of more splendid days,
     This little flower that loves the lea
     May well my simple emblem be;
     It drinks heaven's dew as blithe as rose
     That in the King's own garden grows;
     And when I place it in my hair,
     Allan, a bard is bound to swear
     He ne'er saw coronet so fair.'
     Then playfully the chaplet wild
     She wreathed in her dark locks, and smiled.


     X.

     Her smile, her speech, with winning sway
     Wiled the old Harper's mood away.
     With such a look as hermits throw,
     When angels stoop to soothe their woe
     He gazed, till fond regret and pride
     Thrilled to a tear, then thus replied:
     'Loveliest and best! thou little know'st
     The rank, the honors, thou hast lost!
     O. might I live to see thee grace,
     In Scotland's court, thy birthright place,
     To see my favorite's step advance
     The lightest in the courtly dance,
     The cause of every gallant's sigh,
     And leading star of every eye,
     And theme of every minstrel's art,
     The Lady of the Bleeding Heart!'


     XI.

     'Fair dreams are these,' the maiden cried,--
     Light was her accent, yet she sighed,--
     'Yet is this mossy rock to me
     Worth splendid chair and canopy;
     Nor would my footstep spring more gay
     In courtly dance than blithe strathspey,
     Nor half so pleased mine ear incline
     To royal minstrel's lay as thine.
     And then for suitors proud and high,
     To bend before my conquering eye,--
     Thou, flattering bard! thyself wilt say,
     That grim Sir Roderick owns its sway.
     The Saxon scourge, Clan-Alpine's pride,
     The terror of Loch Lomond's side,
     Would, at my suit, thou know'st, delay
     A Lennox foray--for a day.'--


     XII..

     The ancient bard her glee repressed:
     'Ill hast thou chosen theme for jest!
     For who, through all this western wild,
     Named Black Sir Roderick e'er, and smiled?
     In Holy-Rood a knight he slew;
     I saw, when back the dirk he drew,
     Courtiers give place before the stride
     Of the undaunted homicide;
     And since, though outlawed, hath his hand
     Full sternly kept his mountain land.

     Who else dared give--ah! woe the day,
     That I such hated truth should say!--
     The Douglas, like a stricken deer,
     Disowned by every noble peer,
     Even the rude refuge we have here?
     Alas, this wild marauding
     Chief Alone might hazard our relief,
     And now thy maiden charms expand,
     Looks for his guerdon in thy hand;
     Full soon may dispensation sought,
     To back his suit, from Rome be brought.
     Then, though an exile on the hill,
     Thy father, as the Douglas, still
     Be held in reverence and fear;
     And though to Roderick thou'rt so dear
     That thou mightst guide with silken thread.
     Slave of thy will, this chieftain dread,
     Yet, O loved maid, thy mirth refrain!
     Thy hand is on a lion's mane.'--


     XIII.

     Minstrel,' the maid replied, and high
     Her father's soul glanced from her eye,
     'My debts to Roderick's house I know:
     All that a mother could bestow
     To Lady Margaret's care I owe,
     Since first an orphan in the wild
     She sorrowed o'er her sister's child;
     To her brave chieftain son, from ire
     Of Scotland's king who shrouds my sire,
     A deeper, holier debt is owed;
     And, could I pay it with my blood, Allan!
     Sir Roderick should command
     My blood, my life,--but not my hand.
     Rather will Ellen Douglas dwell
     A votaress in Maronnan's cell;
     Rather through realms beyond the sea,
     Seeking the world's cold charity
     Where ne'er was spoke a Scottish word,
     And ne'er the name of Douglas heard
     An outcast pilgrim will she rove,
     Than wed the man she cannot love.


     XIV.

     'Thou shak'st, good friend, thy tresses gray,--
     That pleading look, what can it say
     But what I own?--I grant him brave,
     But wild as Bracklinn's thundering wave;
     And generous,--save vindictive mood
     Or jealous transport chafe his blood:
     I grant him true to friendly band,
     As his claymore is to his hand;
     But O! that very blade of steel
     More mercy for a foe would feel:
     I grant him liberal, to fling
     Among his clan the wealth they bring,
     When back by lake and glen they wind,
     And in the Lowland leave behind,
     Where once some pleasant hamlet stood,
     A mass of ashes slaked with blood.
     The hand that for my father fought
     I honor, as his daughter ought;
     But can I clasp it reeking red
     From peasants slaughtered in their shed?
     No! wildly while his virtues gleam,
     They make his passions darker seem,
     And flash along his spirit high,
     Like lightning o'er the midnight sky.
     While yet a child,--and children know,
     Instinctive taught, the friend and foe,--
     I shuddered at his brow of gloom,
     His shadowy plaid and sable plume;
     A maiden grown, I ill could bear
     His haughty mien and lordly air:
     But, if thou join'st a suitor's claim,
     In serious mood, to Roderick's name.
     I thrill with anguish! or, if e'er
     A Douglas knew the word, with fear.
     To change such odious theme were best,--
     What think'st thou of our stranger guest? '--


     XV.

     'What think I of him?--woe the while
     That brought such wanderer to our isle!
     Thy father's battle-brand, of yore
     For Tine-man forged by fairy lore,
     What time he leagued, no longer foes
     His Border spears with Hotspur's bows,
     Did, self-unscabbarded, foreshow
     The footstep of a secret foe.
     If courtly spy hath harbored here,
     What may we for the Douglas fear?
     What for this island, deemed of old
     Clan-Alpine's last and surest hold?
     If neither spy nor foe, I pray
     What yet may jealous Roderick say?--
     Nay, wave not thy disdainful head!
     Bethink thee of the discord dread
     That kindled when at Beltane game
     Thou least the dance with Malcolm Graeme;
     Still, though thy sire the peace renewed
     Smoulders in Roderick's breast the feud:
     Beware!--But hark! what sounds are these?
     My dull ears catch no faltering breeze
     No weeping birch nor aspens wake,
     Nor breath is dimpling in the lake;
     Still is the canna's hoary beard,
     Yet, by my minstrel faith, I heard--
     And hark again! some pipe of war
     Sends the hold pibroch from afar.'


     XVI.

     Far up the lengthened lake were spied
     Four darkening specks upon the tide,
     That, slow enlarging on the view,
     Four manned and massed barges grew,
     And, bearing downwards from Glengyle,
     Steered full upon the lonely isle;
     The point of Brianchoil they passed,
     And, to the windward as they cast,
     Against the sun they gave to shine
     The bold Sir Roderick's bannered Pine.
     Nearer and nearer as they bear,
     Spears, pikes, and axes flash in air.
     Now might you see the tartars brave,
     And plaids and plumage dance and wave:
     Now see the bonnets sink and rise,
     As his tough oar the rower plies;
     See, flashing at each sturdy stroke,
     The wave ascending into smoke;
     See the proud pipers on the bow,
     And mark the gaudy streamers flow
     From their loud chanters down, and sweep
     The furrowed bosom of the deep,
     As, rushing through the lake amain,
     They plied the ancient Highland strain.


     XVII.

     Ever, as on they bore, more loud
     And louder rung the pibroch proud.
     At first the sounds, by distance tame,
     Mellowed along the waters came,
     And, lingering long by cape and bay,
     Wailed every harsher note away,
     Then bursting bolder on the ear,
     The clan's shrill Gathering they could hear,
     Those thrilling sounds that call the might
     Of old Clan-Alpine to the fight.
     Thick beat the rapid notes, as when
     The mustering hundreds shake the glen,
     And hurrying at the signal dread,
     'Fine battered earth returns their tread.
     Then prelude light, of livelier tone,
     Expressed their merry marching on,
     Ere peal of closing battle rose,
     With mingled outcry, shrieks, and blows;
     And mimic din of stroke and ward,
     As broadsword upon target jarred;
     And groaning pause, ere yet again,
     Condensed, the battle yelled amain:
     The rapid charge, the rallying shout,
     Retreat borne headlong into rout,
     And bursts of triumph, to declare
     Clan-Alpine's congest--all were there.
     Nor ended thus the strain, but slow
     Sunk in a moan prolonged and low,
     And changed the conquering clarion swell
     For wild lament o'er those that fell.


      XVIII.

     The war-pipes ceased, but lake and hill
     Were busy with their echoes still;
     And, when they slept, a vocal strain
     Bade their hoarse chorus wake again,
     While loud a hundred clansmen raise
     Their voices in their Chieftain's praise.
     Each boatman, bending to his oar,
     With measured sweep the burden bore,
     In such wild cadence as the breeze
     Makes through December's leafless trees.
     The chorus first could Allan know,
     'Roderick Vich Alpine, ho! fro!'
     And near, and nearer as they rowed,
     Distinct the martial ditty flowed.


     XIX.

     Boat Song

     Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances!
          Honored and blessed be the ever-green Pine!
     Long may the tree, in his banner that glances,
          Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line!
               Heaven send it happy dew,
               Earth lend it sap anew,
          Gayly to bourgeon and broadly to grow,
               While every Highland glen
               Sends our shout back again,
          'Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!'

     Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,

          Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade;
     When the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain,
          The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade.
               Moored in the rifted rock,
               Proof to the tempest's shock,
          Firmer he roots him the ruder it blow;
               Menteith and Breadalbane, then,
               Echo his praise again,
          'Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!'


     XX.

     Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin,
          And Bannochar's groans to our slogan replied;
     Glen Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin,
          And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on her side.
               Widow and Saxon maid
               Long shall lament our raid,
          Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and with woe;
               Lennox and Leven-glen
               Shake when they hear again,
     'Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!'

     Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands!
          Stretch to your oars for the ever-green Pine!
     O that the rosebud that graces yon islands
          Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!
               O that some seedling gem,
               Worthy such noble stem,
          Honored and blessed in their shadow might grow!
               Loud should Clan-Alpine then
               Ring from her deepmost glen,
          Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!'


     XXI.

     With all her joyful female band
     Had Lady Margaret sought the strand.
     Loose on the breeze their tresses flew,
     And high their snowy arms they threw,
     As echoing back with shrill acclaim,
     And chorus wild, the Chieftain's name;
     While, prompt to please, with mother's art
     The darling passion of his heart,
     The Dame called Ellen to the strand,
     To greet her kinsman ere he land:
      'Come, loiterer, come! a Douglas thou,
     And shun to wreathe a victor's brow?'
     Reluctantly and slow, the maid
     The unwelcome summoning obeyed,
     And when a distant bugle rung,
     In the mid-path aside she sprung:--
     'List, Allan-bane! From mainland cast
     I hear my father's signal blast.
     Be ours,' she cried, 'the skiff to guide,
     And waft him from the mountain-side.'
     Then, like a sunbeam, swift and bright,
     She darted to her shallop light,
     And, eagerly while Roderick scanned,
     For her dear form, his mother's band,
     The islet far behind her lay,
     And she had landed in the bay.


     XXII.

     Some feelings are to mortals given
     With less of earth in them than heaven;
     And if there be a human tear
     From passion's dross refined and clear,
     A tear so limpid and so meek
     It would not stain an angel's cheek,
     'Tis that which pious fathers shed
     Upon a duteous daughter's head!
     And as the Douglas to his breast
     His darling Ellen closely pressed,
     Such holy drops her tresses steeped,
     Though 't was an hero's eye that weeped.
     Nor while on Ellen's faltering tongue
     Her filial welcomes crowded hung,
      Marked she that fear--affection's proof--
     Still held a graceful youth aloof;
     No! not till Douglas named his name,
     Although the youth was Malcolm Graeme.


     XXIII.

     Allan, with wistful look the while,
     Marked Roderick landing on the isle;
     His master piteously he eyed,
     Then gazed upon the Chieftain's pride,
     Then dashed with hasty hand away
     From his dimmed eye the gathering spray;
     And Douglas, as his hand he laid
     On Malcolm's shoulder, kindly said:
     'Canst thou, young friend, no meaning spy
     In my poor follower's glistening eye?
     I 'll tell thee:--he recalls the day
     When in my praise he led the lay
     O'er the arched gate of Bothwell proud,
     While many a minstrel answered loud,
     When Percy's Norman pennon, won
     In bloody field, before me shone,
     And twice ten knights, the least a name
     As mighty as yon Chief may claim,
     Gracing my pomp, behind me came.
     Yet trust me, Malcolm, not so proud
     Was I of all that marshalled crowd,
     Though the waned crescent owned my might,
     And in my train trooped lord and knight,
     Though Blantyre hymned her holiest lays,
     And Bothwell's bards flung back my praise,
     As when this old man's silent tear,
     And this poor maid's affection dear,
     A welcome give more kind and true
     Than aught my better fortunes knew.
     Forgive, my friend, a father's boast,--
     O, it out-beggars all I lost!'


     XXIV.

     Delightful praise!--like summer rose,
     That brighter in the dew-drop glows,
     The bashful maiden's cheek appeared,
     For Douglas spoke, and Malcolm heard.
     The flush of shame-faced joy to hide,
     The hounds, the hawk, her cares divide;
     The loved caresses of the maid
     The dogs with crouch and whimper paid;
     And, at her whistle, on her hand
     The falcon took his favorite stand,
     Closed his dark wing, relaxed his eye,
     Nor, though unhooded, sought to fly.
     And, trust, while in such guise she stood,
     Like fabled Goddess of the wood,
     That if a father's partial thought
     O'erweighed her worth and beauty aught,
     Well might the lover's judgment fail
     To balance with a juster scale;
     For with each secret glance he stole,
     The fond enthusiast sent his soul.


     XXV.

     Of stature fair, and slender frame,
     But firmly knit, was Malcolm Graeme.
     The belted plaid and tartan hose
     Did ne'er more graceful limbs disclose;
     His flaxen hair, of sunny hue,
     Curled closely round his bonnet blue.
     Trained to the chase, his eagle eye
     The ptarmigan in snow could spy;
     Each pass, by mountain, lake, and heath,
     He knew, through Lennox and Menteith;
     Vain was the bound of dark-brown doe
     When Malcolm bent his sounding bow,
     And scarce that doe, though winged with fear,
     Outstripped in speed the mountaineer:
     Right up Ben Lomond could he press,
     And not a sob his toil confess.
     His form accorded with a mind
     Lively and ardent, frank and kind;
     A blither heart, till Ellen came
     Did never love nor sorrow tame;
     It danced as lightsome in his breast
     As played the feather on his crest.
     Yet friends, who nearest knew the youth
     His scorn of wrong, his zeal for truth
     And bards, who saw his features bold
     When kindled by the tales of old
     Said, were that youth to manhood grown,
     Not long should Roderick Dhu's renown
     Be foremost voiced by mountain fame,
     But quail to that of Malcolm Graeme.


     XXVI.

     Now back they wend their watery way,
     And, 'O my sire!' did Ellen say,
     'Why urge thy chase so far astray?
     And why so late returned? And why '--
     The rest was in her speaking eye.
     'My child, the chase I follow far,
     'Tis mimicry of noble war;
     And with that gallant pastime reft
     Were all of Douglas I have left.
     I met young Malcolm as I strayed
     Far eastward, in Glenfinlas' shade
     Nor strayed I safe, for all around
     Hunters and horsemen scoured the ground.
     This youth, though still a royal ward,
     Risked life and land to be my guard,
     And through the passes of the wood
     Guided my steps, not unpursued;
     And Roderick shall his welcome make,
     Despite old spleen, for Douglas' sake.
     Then must he seek Strath-Endrick glen
     Nor peril aught for me again.'


     XXVII.

     Sir Roderick, who to meet them came,
     Reddened at sight of Malcolm Graeme,
     Yet, not in action, word, or eye,
     Failed aught in hospitality.
     In talk and sport they whiled away
     The morning of that summer day;
     But at high noon a courier light
     Held secret parley with the knight,
     Whose moody aspect soon declared
     That evil were the news he heard.
     Deep thought seemed toiling in his head;
     Yet was the evening banquet made
     Ere he assembled round the flame
     His mother, Douglas, and the Graeme,
     And Ellen too; then cast around
     His eyes, then fixed them on the ground,
     As studying phrase that might avail
     Best to convey unpleasant tale.
     Long with his dagger's hilt he played,
     Then raised his haughty brow, and said:--


     XXVIII.

     'Short be my speech;--nor time affords,
     Nor my plain temper, glozing words.
     Kinsman and father,--if such name
     Douglas vouchsafe to Roderick's claim;
     Mine honored mother;--Ellen,--why,
     My cousin, turn away thine eye?--
     And Graeme, in whom I hope to know
     Full soon a noble friend or foe,
     When age shall give thee thy command,
     And leading in thy native land,--
     List all!--The King's vindictive pride
     Boasts to have tamed the Border-side,
     Where chiefs, with hound and trawl; who came
     To share their monarch's sylvan game,
     Themselves in bloody toils were snared,
     And when the banquet they prepared,
     And wide their loyal portals flung,
     O'er their own gateway struggling hung.
     Loud cries their blood from Meggat's mead,
     From Yarrow braes and banks of Tweed,
     Where the lone streams of Ettrick glide,
     And from the silver Teviot's side;
     The dales, where martial clans did ride,
     Are now one sheep-walk, waste and wide.
     This tyrant of the Scottish throne,
     So faithless and so ruthless known,
     Now hither comes; his end the same,
     The same pretext of sylvan game.
     What grace for Highland Chiefs, judge ye
     By fate of Border chivalry.
     Yet more; amid Glenfinlas' green,
     Douglas, thy stately form was seen.
     This by espial sure I know:
     Your counsel in the streight I show.'


     XXIX.

     Ellen and Margaret fearfully
     Sought comfort in each other's eye,
     Then turned their ghastly look, each one,
     This to her sire, that to her son.
     The hasty color went and came
     In the bold cheek of Malcohm Graeme,
     But from his glance it well appeared
     'T was but for Ellen that he feared;
     While, sorrowful, but undismayed,
     The Douglas thus his counsel said:
     'Brave Roderick, though the tempest roar,
     It may but thunder and pass o'er;
     Nor will I here remain an hour,
     To draw the lightning on thy bower;
     For well thou know'st, at this gray head
     The royal bolt were fiercest sped.
     For thee, who, at thy King's command,
     Canst aid him with a gallant band,
     Submission, homage, humbled pride,
     Shall turn the Monarch's wrath aside.
     Poor remnants of the Bleeding Heart,
     Ellen and I will seek apart
     The refuge of some forest cell,
     There, like the hunted quarry, dwell,
     Till on the mountain and the moor
     The stern pursuit be passed and o'er,'--


     XXX.

     'No, by mine honor,' Roderick said,
     'So help me Heaven, and my good blade!
     No, never! Blasted be yon Pine,
     My father's ancient crest and mine,
     If from its shade in danger part
     The lineage of the Bleeding Heart!
     Hear my blunt speech: grant me this maid
     To wife, thy counsel to mine aid;
     To Douglas, leagued with Roderick Dhu,
     Will friends and allies flock enow;
     Like cause of doubt, distrust, and grief,
     Will bind to us each Western Chief
     When the loud pipes my bridal tell,
     The Links of Forth shall hear the knell,
     The guards shall start in Stirling's porch;
     And when I light the nuptial torch,
     A thousand villages in flames
     Shall scare the slumbers of King James!--
     Nay, Ellen, blench not thus away,
     And, mother, cease these signs, I pray;
     I meant not all my heat might say.--
     Small need of inroad or of fight,
     When the sage Douglas may unite
     Each mountain clan in friendly band,
     To guard the passes of their land,
     Till the foiled King from pathless glen
     Shall bootless turn him home again.'


     XXXI.

     There are who have, at midnight hour,
     In slumber scaled a dizzy tower,
     And, on the verge that beetled o'er
     The ocean tide's incessant roar,
     Dreamed calmly out their dangerous dream,
     Till wakened by the morning beam;
     When, dazzled by the eastern glow,
     Such startler cast his glance below,
     And saw unmeasured depth around,
     And heard unintermitted sound,
     And thought the battled fence so frail,
     It waved like cobweb in the gale;
     Amid his senses' giddy wheel,
     Did he not desperate impulse feel,
     Headlong to plunge himself below,
     And meet the worst his fears foreshow?--
     Thus Ellen, dizzy and astound,
     As sudden ruin yawned around,
     By crossing terrors wildly tossed,
     Still for the Douglas fearing most,
     Could scarce the desperate thought withstand,
     To buy his safety with her hand.


     XXXII.

     Such purpose dread could Malcolm spy
     In Ellen's quivering lip and eye,
     And eager rose to speak,--but ere
     His tongue could hurry forth his fear,
     Had Douglas marked the hectic strife,
     Where death seemed combating with life;
     For to her cheek, in feverish flood,
     One instant rushed the throbbing blood,
     Then ebbing back, with sudden sway,
     Left its domain as wan as clay.
     'Roderick, enough! enough!' he cried,
     'My daughter cannot be thy bride;
     Not that the blush to wooer dear,
     Nor paleness that of maiden fear.
     It may not be,--forgive her,
     Chief, Nor hazard aught for our relief.
     Against his sovereign, Douglas ne'er
     Will level a rebellious spear.
     'T was I that taught his youthful hand
     To rein a steed and wield a brand;
     I see him yet, the princely boy!
     Not Ellen more my pride and joy;
     I love him still, despite my wrongs
     By hasty wrath and slanderous tongues.
     O. seek the grace you well may find,
     Without a cause to mine combined!'


     XXXIII.

     Twice through the hall the Chieftain strode;
     The waving of his tartars broad,
     And darkened brow, where wounded pride
     With ire and disappointment vied
     Seemed, by the torch's gloomy light,
     Like the ill Demon of the night,
     Stooping his pinions' shadowy sway
     Upon the righted pilgrim's way:
     But, unrequited Love! thy dart
     Plunged deepest its envenomed smart,
     And Roderick, with thine anguish stung,
     At length the hand of Douglas wrung,
     While eyes that mocked at tears before
     With bitter drops were running o'er.
     The death-pangs of long-cherished hope
     Scarce in that ample breast had scope
     But, struggling with his spirit proud,
     Convulsive heaved its checkered shroud,
     While every sob--so mute were all
     Was heard distinctly through the ball.
     The son's despair, the mother's look,
     III might the gentle Ellen brook;
     She rose, and to her side there came,
     To aid her parting steps, the Graeme.


     XXXIV.

     Then Roderick from the Douglas broke--
     As flashes flame through sable smoke,
     Kindling its wreaths, long, dark, and low,
     To one broad blaze of ruddy glow,
     So the deep anguish of despair
     Burst, in fierce jealousy, to air.
     With stalwart grasp his hand he laid
     On Malcolm's breast and belted plaid:
     'Back, beardless boy!' he sternly said,
     'Back, minion! holdst thou thus at naught
     The lesson I so lately taught?
     This roof, the Douglas, and that maid,
     Thank thou for punishment delayed.'
     Eager as greyhound on his game,
     Fiercely with Roderick grappled Graeme.
     'Perish my name, if aught afford
     Its Chieftain safety save his sword!'
     Thus as they strove their desperate hand
     Griped to the dagger or the brand,
     And death had been--but Douglas rose,
     And thrust between the struggling foes
     His giant strength:--' Chieftains, forego!
     I hold the first who strikes my foe.--
     Madmen, forbear your frantic jar!
     What! is the Douglas fallen so far,
     His daughter's hand is deemed the spoil
     Of such dishonorable broil?'
     Sullen and slowly they unclasp,
     As struck with shame, their desperate grasp,
     And each upon his rival glared,
     With foot advanced and blade half bared.


     XXXV.

     Ere yet the brands aloft were flung,
     Margaret on Roderick's mantle hung,
     And Malcolm heard his Ellen's scream,
     As faltered through terrific dream.
     Then Roderick plunged in sheath his sword,
     And veiled his wrath in scornful word:'
     Rest safe till morning; pity 't were
     Such cheek should feel the midnight air!
     Then mayst thou to James Stuart tell,
     Roderick will keep the lake and fell,
     Nor lackey with his freeborn clan
     The pageant pomp of earthly man.
     More would he of Clan-Alpine know,
     Thou canst our strength and passes show.--
     Malise, what ho!'--his henchman came:
     'Give our safe-conduct to the Graeme.'
     Young Malcolm answered, calm and bold:'
     Fear nothing for thy favorite hold;
     The spot an angel deigned to grace
     Is blessed, though robbers haunt the place.
     Thy churlish courtesy for those
     Reserve, who fear to be thy foes.
     As safe to me the mountain way
     At midnight as in blaze of day,
     Though with his boldest at his back
     Even Roderick Dhu beset the track.--
     Brave Douglas,--lovely Ellen,--nay,
     Naught here of parting will I say.
     Earth does not hold a lonesome glen
     So secret but we meet again.--
     Chieftain! we too shall find an hour,'--
     He said, and left the sylvan bower.


     XXXVI.

     Old Allan followed to the strand--
     Such was the Douglas's command--
     And anxious told, how, on the morn,
     The stern Sir Roderick deep had sworn,
     The Fiery Cross should circle o'er
     Dale, glen, and valley, down and moor
     Much were the peril to the Graeme
     From those who to the signal came;
     Far up the lake 't were safest land,
     Himself would row him to the strand.
     He gave his counsel to the wind,
     While Malcolm did, unheeding, bind,
     Round dirk and pouch and broadsword rolled,
     His ample plaid in tightened fold,
     And stripped his limbs to such array
     As best might suit the watery way,--


     XXXVII.

     Then spoke abrupt: 'Farewell to thee,
     Pattern of old fidelity!'
      The Minstrel's hand he kindly pressed,--
     'O, could I point a place of rest!
     My sovereign holds in ward my land,
     My uncle leads my vassal band;
     To tame his foes, his friends to aid,
     Poor Malcolm has but heart and blade.
     Yet, if there be one faithful Graeme
     Who loves the chieftain of his name,
     Not long shall honored Douglas dwell
     Like hunted stag in mountain cell;
     Nor, ere yon pride-swollen robber dare,--
     I may not give the rest to air!
     Tell Roderick Dhu I owed him naught,
     Not tile poor service of a boat,
     To waft me to yon mountain-side.'
     Then plunged he in the flashing tide.
     Bold o'er the flood his head he bore,
     And stoutly steered him from the shore;
     And Allan strained his anxious eye,
     Far mid the lake his form to spy,
     Darkening across each puny wave,
     To which the moon her silver gave.
     Fast as the cormorant could skim.
     The swimmer plied each active limb;
     Then landing in the moonlight dell,
     Loud shouted of his weal to tell.
     The Minstrel heard the far halloo,
     And joyful from the shore withdrew.




CANTO THIRD.

The Gathering.


     I.

     Time rolls his ceaseless course. The race of yore,
          Who danced our infancy upon their knee,
     And told our marvelling boyhood legends store
          Of their strange ventures happed by land or sea,
     How are they blotted from the things that be!
          How few, all weak and withered of their force,
     Wait on the verge of dark eternity,
          Like stranded wrecks, the tide returning hoarse,
     To sweep them from out sight! Time rolls his ceaseless course.

     Yet live there still who can remember well,
          How, when a mountain chief his bugle blew,
     Both field and forest, dingle, cliff; and dell,
          And solitary heath, the signal knew;
     And fast the faithful clan around him drew.
          What time the warning note was keenly wound,
     What time aloft their kindred banner flew,
          While clamorous war-pipes yelled the gathering sound,
     And while the Fiery Cross glanced like a meteor, round.


     II.

     The Summer dawn's reflected hue
     To purple changed Loch Katrine blue;
     Mildly and soft the western breeze
     Just kissed the lake, just stirred the trees,
     And the pleased lake, like maiden coy,
     Trembled but dimpled not for joy
     The mountain-shadows on her breast
     Were neither broken nor at rest;
     In bright uncertainty they lie,
     Like future joys to Fancy's eye.
     The water-lily to the light
     Her chalice reared of silver bright;
     The doe awoke, and to the lawn,
     Begemmed with dew-drops, led her fawn;
     The gray mist left the mountain-side,
     The torrent showed its glistening pride;
     Invisible in flecked sky The lark sent clown her revelry:
     The blackbird and the speckled thrush
     Good-morrow gave from brake and bush;
     In answer cooed the cushat dove
     Her notes of peace and rest and love.


     III.

     No thought of peace, no thought of rest,
     Assuaged the storm in Roderick's breast.
     With sheathed broadsword in his hand,
     Abrupt he paced the islet strand,
     And eyed the rising sun, and laid
     His hand on his impatient blade.
     Beneath a rock, his vassals' care
     Was prompt the ritual to prepare,
     With deep and deathful meaning fraught;
     For such Antiquity had taught
     Was preface meet, ere yet abroad
     The Cross of Fire should take its road.
     The shrinking band stood oft aghast
     At the impatient glance he cast;--
     Such glance the mountain eagle threw,
     As, from the cliffs of Benvenue,
     She spread her dark sails on the wind,
     And, high in middle heaven reclined,
     With her broad shadow on the lake,
     Silenced the warblers of the brake.


     IV.

     A heap of withered boughs was piled,
     Of juniper and rowan wild,
     Mingled with shivers from the oak,
     Rent by the lightning's recent stroke.
     Brian the Hermit by it stood,
     Barefooted, in his frock and hood.
     His grizzled beard and matted hair
     Obscured a visage of despair;
     His naked arms and legs, seamed o'er,
     The scars of frantic penance bore.
     That monk, of savage form and face
     The impending danger of his race
     Had drawn from deepest solitude
     Far in Benharrow's bosom rude.
     Not his the mien of Christian priest,
     But Druid's, from the grave released
     Whose hardened heart and eye might brook
     On human sacrifice to look;
     And much, 't was said, of heathen lore
     Mixed in the charms he muttered o'er.
     The hallowed creed gave only worse
     And deadlier emphasis of curse.
     No peasant sought that Hermit's prayer
     His cave the pilgrim shunned with care,
     The eager huntsman knew his bound
     And in mid chase called off his hound;'
     Or if, in lonely glen or strath,
     The desert-dweller met his path
     He prayed, and signed the cross between,
     While terror took devotion's mien.


     V.

     Of Brian's birth strange tales were told.
     His mother watched a midnight fold,
     Built deep within a dreary glen,
     Where scattered lay the bones of men
     In some forgotten battle slain,
     And bleached by drifting wind and rain.
     It might have tamed a warrior's heart
     To view  such mockery of his art!
     The knot-grass fettered there the hand
     Which once could burst an iron band;
     Beneath the broad and ample bone,
     That bucklered heart to fear unknown,
     A feeble and a timorous guest,
     The fieldfare framed her lowly nest;
     There the slow blindworm left his slime
     On the fleet limbs that mocked at time;
     And there, too, lay the leader's skull
     Still wreathed with chaplet, flushed and full,
     For heath-bell with her purple bloom
     Supplied the bonnet and the plume.
     All night, in this sad glen the maid
     Sat shrouded in her mantle's shade:
     She said no shepherd sought her side,
     No hunter's hand her snood untied.
     Yet ne'er again to braid her hair
     The virgin snood did Alive wear;
     Gone was her maiden glee and sport,
     Her maiden girdle all too short,
     Nor sought she, from that fatal night,
     Or holy church or blessed rite
     But locked her secret in her breast,
     And died in travail, unconfessed.


     VI.

     Alone, among his young compeers,
     Was Brian from his infant years;
     A moody and heart-broken boy,
     Estranged from sympathy and joy
     Bearing each taunt which careless tongue
     On his mysterious lineage flung.
     Whole nights he spent by moonlight pale
     To wood and stream his teal, to wail,
     Till, frantic, he as truth received
     What of his birth the crowd believed,
     And sought, in mist and meteor fire,
     To meet and know his Phantom Sire!
     In vain, to soothe his wayward fate,
     The cloister oped her pitying gate;
     In vain the learning of the age
     Unclasped the sable-lettered page;
     Even in its treasures he could find
     Food for the fever of his mind.
     Eager he read whatever tells
     Of magic, cabala, and spells,
     And every dark pursuit allied
     To curious and presumptuous pride;
     Till with fired brain and nerves o'erstrung,
     And heart with mystic horrors wrung,
     Desperate he sought Benharrow's den,
     And hid him from the haunts of men.


     VII.

     The desert gave him visions wild,
     Such as might suit the spectre's child.
     Where with black cliffs the torrents toil,
     He watched the wheeling eddies boil,
     Jill from their foam his dazzled eyes
     Beheld the River Demon rise:
     The mountain mist took form and limb
     Of noontide hag or goblin grim;
     The midnight wind came wild and dread,
     Swelled with the voices of the dead;
     Far on the future battle-heath
     His eye beheld the ranks of death:
     Thus the lone Seer, from mankind hurled,
     Shaped forth a disembodied world.
     One lingering sympathy of mind
     Still bound him to the mortal kind;
     The only parent he could claim
     Of ancient Alpine's lineage came.
     Late had he heard, in prophet's dream,
     The fatal Ben-Shie's boding scream;
     Sounds, too, had come in midnight blast
     Of charging steeds, careering fast
     Along Benharrow's shingly side,
     Where mortal horseman ne'er might ride;
     The thunderbolt had split the pine,--
     All augured ill to Alpine's line.
     He girt his loins, and came to show
     The signals of impending woe,
     And now stood prompt to bless or ban,
     As bade the Chieftain of his clan.


     VIII.

     'T was all prepared;--and from the rock
     A goat, the patriarch of the flock,
     Before the kindling pile was laid,
     And pierced by Roderick's ready blade.
     Patient the sickening victim eyed
     The life-blood ebb in crimson tide
     Down his clogged beard and shaggy limb,
     Till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim.
     The grisly priest, with murmuring prayer,
     A slender crosslet framed with care,
     A cubit's length in measure due;
     The shaft and limbs were rods of yew,
     Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach wave
     Their shadows o'er Clan-Alpine's grave,
     And, answering Lomond's breezes deep,
     Soothe many a chieftain's endless sleep.
     The Cross thus formed he held on high,
     With wasted hand and haggard eye,
     And strange and mingled feelings woke,
     While his anathema he spoke:--


     IX.

     'Woe to the clansman who shall view
     This symbol of sepulchral yew,
     Forgetful that its branches grew
     Where weep the heavens their holiest dew
          On Alpine's dwelling low!
     Deserter of his Chieftain's trust,
     He ne'er shall mingle with their dust,
     But, from his sires and kindred thrust,
     Each clansman's execration just
          Shall doom him wrath and woe.'
     He paused;--the word the vassals took,
     With forward step and fiery look,
     On high their naked brands they shook,
     Their clattering targets wildly strook;
          And first in murmur low,
     Then like the billow in his course,
     That far to seaward finds his source,
     And flings to shore his mustered force,
     Burst with loud roar their answer hoarse,
     'Woe to the traitor, woe!'
     Ben-an's gray scalp the accents knew,
     The joyous wolf from covert drew,
     The exulting eagle screamed afar,--
     They knew the voice of Alpine's war.


     X.

     The shout was hushed on lake and fell,
     The Monk resumed his muttered spell:
     Dismal and low its accents came,
     The while he scathed the Cross with flame;
     And the few words that reached the air,
     Although the holiest name was there,
     Had more of blasphemy than prayer.
     But when he shook above the crowd
     Its kindled points, he spoke aloud:--
     'Woe to the wretch who fails to rear
     At this dread sign the ready spear!
     For, as the flames this symbol sear,
     His home, the refuge of his fear,
          A kindred fate shall know;
     Far o'er its roof the volumed flame
     Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim,
     While maids and matrons on his name
     Shall call down wretchedness and shame,
          And infamy and woe.'
     Then rose the cry of females, shrill
     As goshawk's whistle on the hill,
     Denouncing misery and ill,
     Mingled with childhood's babbling trill
          Of curses stammered slow;
     Answering with imprecation dread,
     'Sunk be his home in embers red!
     And cursed be the meanest shed
     That o'er shall hide the houseless head
          We doom to want and woe!'
     A sharp and shrieking echo gave,
     Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave!
     And the gray pass where birches wave
          On Beala-nam-bo.


     XI.

     Then deeper paused the priest anew,
     And hard his laboring breath he drew,
     While, with set teeth and clenched hand,
     And eyes that glowed like fiery brand,
     He meditated curse more dread,
     And deadlier, on the clansman's head
     Who, summoned to his chieftain's aid,
     The signal saw and disobeyed.
     The crosslet's points of sparkling wood
     He quenched among the bubbling blood.
     And, as again the sign he reared,
     Hollow and hoarse his voice was heard:
     'When flits this Cross from man to man,
     Vich-Alpine's summons to his clan,
     Burst be the ear that fails to heed!
     Palsied the foot that shuns to speed!
     May ravens tear the careless eyes,
     Wolves make the coward heart their prize!
     As sinks that blood-stream in the earth,
     So may his heart's-blood drench his hearth!
     As dies in hissing gore the spark,
     Quench thou his light, Destruction dark!
     And be the grace to him denied,
     Bought by this sign to all beside!
     He ceased; no echo gave again
     The murmur of the deep Amen.


     XII.

     Then Roderick with impatient look
     From Brian's hand the symbol took:
     'Speed, Malise, speed' he said, and gave
     The crosslet to his henchman brave.
     'The muster-place be Lanrick mead--
     Instant the time---speed, Malise, speed!'
     Like heath-bird, when the hawks pursue,
     A barge across Loch Katrine flew:
     High stood the henchman on the prow;
     So rapidly the barge-mall row,
     The bubbles, where they launched the boat,
     Were all unbroken and afloat,
     Dancing in foam and ripple still,
     When it had neared the mainland hill;
     And from the silver beach's side
     Still was the prow three fathom wide,
     When lightly bounded to the land
     The messenger of blood and brand.


     XIII.

     Speed, Malise, speed! the dun deer's hide
     On fleeter foot was never tied.
     Speed, Malise, speed! such cause of haste
     Thine active sinews never braced.
     Bend 'gainst the steepy hill thy breast,
     Burst down like torrent from its crest;
     With short and springing footstep pass
     The trembling bog and false morass;
     Across the brook like roebuck bound,
     And thread the brake like questing hound;
     The crag is high, the scaur is deep,
     Yet shrink not from the desperate leap:
     Parched are thy burning lips and brow,
     Yet by the fountain pause not now;
     Herald of battle, fate, and fear,
     Stretch onward in thy fleet career!
     The wounded hind thou track'st not now,
     Pursuest not maid through greenwood bough,
     Nor priest thou now thy flying pace
     With rivals in the mountain race;
     But danger, death, and warrior deed
     Are in thy course--speed, Malise, speed!


     XIV.

     Fast as the fatal symbol flies,
     In arms the huts and hamlets rise;
     From winding glen, from upland brown,
     They poured each hardy tenant down.
      Nor slacked the messenger his pace;
     He showed the sign, he named the place,
     And, pressing forward like the wind,
     Left clamor and surprise behind.
     The fisherman forsook the strand,
     The swarthy smith took dirk and brand;
     With changed cheer, the mower blithe
     Left in the half-cut swath his scythe;
     The herds without a keeper strayed,
     The plough was in mid-furrow staved,
     The falconer tossed his hawk away,
     The hunter left the stag at hay;
     Prompt at the signal of alarms,
     Each son of Alpine rushed to arms;
     So swept the tumult and affray
     Along the margin of Achray.
     Alas, thou lovely lake! that e'er
     Thy banks should echo sounds of fear!
     The rocks, the bosky thickets, sleep
     So stilly on thy bosom deep,
     The lark's blithe carol from the cloud
     Seems for the scene too gayly loud.


     XV.

     Speed, Malise, speed! The lake is past,
     Duncraggan's huts appear at last,
     And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen
     Half hidden in the copse so green;
     There mayst thou rest, thy labor done,
     Their lord shall speed the signal on.--
     As stoops the hawk upon his prey,
     The henchman shot him down the way.
     What woful accents load the gale?
     The funeral yell, the female wail!
     A gallant hunter's sport is o'er,
     A valiant warrior fights no more.
     Who, in the battle or the chase,
     At Roderick's side shall fill his place!--
     Within the hall, where torch's ray
     Supplies the excluded beams of day,
     Lies Duncan on his lowly bier,
     And o'er him streams his widow's tear.
     His stripling son stands mournful by,
     His youngest weeps, but knows not why;
     The village maids and matrons round
     The dismal coronach resound.


     XVI.

     Coronach.

     He is gone on the mountain,
          He is lost to the forest,
     Like a summer-dried fountain,
          When our need was the sorest.
     The font, reappearing,
          From the rain-drops shall borrow,
     But to us comes no cheering,
          To Duncan no morrow!

     The hand of the reaper
          Takes the ears that are hoary,
     But the voice of the weeper
          Wails manhood in glory.
     The autumn winds rushing
          Waft the leaves that are searest,
     But our flower was in flushing,
          When blighting was nearest.

     Fleet foot on the correi,
          Sage counsel in cumber,
     Red hand in the foray,
          How sound is thy slumber!
     Like the dew on the mountain,
          Like the foam on the river,
     Like the bubble on the fountain,
          Thou art gone, and forever!


     XVII.

     See Stumah, who, the bier beside
     His master's corpse with wonder eyed,
     Poor Stumah! whom his least halloo
     Could send like lightning o'er the dew,
     Bristles his crest, and points his ears,
     As if some stranger step he hears.
     'T is not a mourner's muffled tread,
     Who comes to sorrow o'er the dead,
     But headlong haste or deadly fear
     Urge the precipitate career.
     All stand aghast:--unheeding all,
     The henchman bursts into the hall;
     Before the dead man's bier he stood,
     Held forth the Cross besmeared with blood;
     'The muster-place is Lanrick mead;
     Speed forth the signal! clansmen, speed!'


     XVIII,

     Angus, the heir of Duncan's line,
     Sprung forth and seized the fatal sign.
     In haste the stripling to his side
      His father's dirk and broadsword tied;
     But when he saw his mother's eye
     Watch him in speechless agony,
     Back to her opened arms he flew
     Pressed on her lips a fond adieu,--
     'Alas' she sobbed,--'and yet be gone,
     And speed thee forth, like Duncan's son!'
     One look he cast upon the bier,
     Dashed from his eye the gathering tear,
     Breathed deep to clear his laboring breast,
     And tossed aloft his bonnet crest,
     Then, like the high-bred colt when, freed,
     First he essays his fire and speed,
     He vanished, and o'er moor and moss
     Sped forward with the Fiery Cross.
     Suspended was the widow's tear
     While yet his footsteps she could hear;
     And when she marked the henchman's eye
     Wet with unwonted sympathy,
     'Kinsman,' she said, 'his race is run
     That should have sped thine errand on.
     The oak teas fallen?--the sapling bough Is all
     Duncraggan's shelter now
     Yet trust I well, his duty done,
     The orphan's God will guard my son.--
     And you, in many a danger true
     At Duncan's hest your blades that drew,
     To arms, and guard that orphan's head!
     Let babes and women wail the dead.'
     Then weapon-clang and martial call
     Resounded through the funeral hall,
     While from the walls the attendant band
     Snatched sword and targe with hurried hand;
     And short and flitting energy
     Glanced from the mourner's sunken eye,
     As if the sounds to warrior dear
     Might rouse her Duncan from his bier.
     But faded soon that borrowed force;
     Grief claimed his right, and tears their course.


     XIX.

     Benledi saw the Cross of Fire,
     It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.
     O'er dale and hill the summons flew,
     Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;
     The tear that gathered in his eye
     He deft the mountain-breeze to dry;
     Until, where Teith's young waters roll
     Betwixt him and a wooded knoll
     That graced the sable strath with green,
     The chapel of Saint Bride was seen.
     Swoln was the stream, remote the bridge,
     But Angus paused not on the edge;
     Though the clerk waves danced dizzily,
     Though reeled his sympathetic eye,
     He dashed amid the torrent's roar:
     His right hand high the crosslet bore,
     His left the pole-axe grasped, to guide
     And stay his footing in the tide.
     He stumbled twice,--the foam splashed high,
     With hoarser swell the stream raced by;
     And had he fallen,--forever there,
     Farewell Duncraggan's orphan heir!
     But still, as if in parting life,
     Firmer he grasped the Cross of strife,
     Until the opposing bank he gained,
     And up the chapel pathway strained.
     A blithesome rout that morning-tide
     Had sought the chapel of Saint Bride.
     Her troth Tombea's Mary gave
     To Norman, heir of Armandave,
     And, issuing from the Gothic arch,
     The bridal now resumed their march.
     In rude but glad procession came
     Bonneted sire and coif-clad dame;
     And plaided youth, with jest and jeer
     Which snooded maiden would not hear:
     And children, that, unwitting why,
     Lent the gay shout their shrilly cry;
     And minstrels, that in measures vied
     Before the young and bonny bride,
     Whose downcast eye and cheek disclose
     The tear and blush of morning rose.
     With virgin step and bashful hand
     She held the kerchief's snowy band.
     The gallant bridegroom by her side
     Beheld his prize with victor's pride.
     And the glad mother in her ear
     Was closely whispering word of cheer.


     XXI.

     Who meets them at the churchyard gate?
     The messenger of fear and fate!
     Haste in his hurried accent lies,
     And grief is swimming in his eyes.
     All dripping from the recent flood,
     Panting and travel-soiled he stood,
     The fatal sign of fire and sword
     Held forth, and spoke the appointed word:
     'The muster-place is Lanrick mead;
     Speed forth the signal! Norman, speed!'
     And must he change so soon the hand
     Just linked to his by holy band,
     For the fell Cross of blood and brand?
     And must the day so blithe that rose,
     And promised rapture in the close,
     Before its setting hour, divide
     The bridegroom from the plighted bride?
     O fatal doom'--it must! it must!
     Clan-Alpine's cause, her Chieftain's trust,
     Her summons dread, brook no delay;
     Stretch to the race,--away! away!


     XXII.

     Yet slow he laid his plaid aside,
     And lingering eyed his lovely bride,
     Until he saw the starting tear
     Speak woe he might not stop to cheer:
     Then, trusting not a second look,
     In haste he sped hind up the brook,
     Nor backward glanced till on the heath
     Where Lubnaig's lake supplies the Teith,--
     What in the racer's bosom stirred?
     The sickening pang of hope deferred,
     And memory with a torturing train
     Of all his morning visions vain.
     Mingled with love's impatience, came
     The manly thirst for martial fame;
     The stormy joy of mountaineers
     Ere yet they rush upon the spears;
     And zeal for Clan and Chieftain burning,
     And hope, from well-fought field returning,
     With war's red honors on his crest,
     To clasp his Mary to his breast.
     Stung by such thoughts, o'er bank and brae,
     Like fire from flint he glanced away,
     While high resolve and feeling strong
     Burst into voluntary song.


     XXIII.

     Song.

     The heath this night must be my bed,
     The bracken curtain for my head,
     My lullaby the warder's tread,
          Far, far, from love and thee, Mary;
     To-morrow eve, more stilly laid,
     My couch may be my bloody plaid,
     My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid!
          It will not waken me, Mary!

     I may not, dare not, fancy now
     The grief that clouds thy lovely brow,
     I dare not think upon thy vow,
          And all it promised me, Mary.
     No fond regret must Norman know;
     When bursts Clan-Alpine on the foe,
     His heart must be like bended bow,
          His foot like arrow free, Mary.

     A time will come with feeling fraught,
     For, if I fall in battle fought,
     Thy hapless lover's dying thought
          Shall be a thought on thee, Mary.
     And if returned from conquered foes,
     How blithely will the evening close,
     How sweet the linnet sing repose,
          To my young bride and me, Mary!


     XXIV.

     Not faster o'er thy heathery braes
     Balquidder, speeds the midnight blaze,
     Rushing in conflagration strong
     Thy deep ravines and dells along,
     Wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow,
     And reddening the dark lakes below;
     Nor faster speeds it, nor so far,
     As o'er thy heaths the voice of war.
     The signal roused to martial coil
     The sullen margin of Loch Voil,
     Waked still Loch Doine, and to the source
     Alarmed, Balvaig, thy swampy course;
     Thence southward turned its rapid road
     Adown Strath-Gartney's valley broad
     Till rose in arms each man might claim
     A portion in Clan-Alpine's name,
     From the gray sire, whose trembling hand
     Could hardly buckle on his brand,
     To the raw boy, whose shaft and bow
     Were yet scarce terror to the crow.
     Each valley, each sequestered glen,
     Mustered its little horde of men
     That met as torrents from the height
     In Highland dales their streams unite
     Still gathering, as they pour along,
     A voice more loud, a tide more strong,
     Till at the rendezvous they stood
     By hundreds prompt for blows and blood,
     Each trained to arms since life began,
     Owning no tie but to his clan,
     No oath but by his chieftain's hand,
     No law but Roderick Dhu's command.


     XXV.

     That summer morn had Roderick Dhu
     Surveyed the skirts of Benvenue,
     And sent his scouts o'er hill and heath,
     To view the frontiers of Menteith.
     All backward came with news of truce;
     Still lay each martial Graeme and Bruce,
     In Rednock courts no horsemen wait,
     No banner waved on Cardross gate,
     On Duchray's towers no beacon shone,
     Nor scared the herons from Loch Con;
     All seemed at peace.--Now wot ye wily
     The Chieftain with such anxious eye,
     Ere to the muster he repair,
     This western frontier scanned with care?--
     In Benvenue's most darksome cleft,
     A fair though cruel pledge was left;
     For Douglas, to his promise true,
     That morning from the isle withdrew,
     And in a deep sequestered dell
     Had sought a low and lonely cell.
     By many a bard in Celtic tongue
     Has Coir-nan-Uriskin been sung
     A softer name the Saxons gave,
     And called the grot the Goblin Cave.


     XXVI.

     It was a wild and strange retreat,
     As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet.
     The dell, upon the mountain's crest,
     Yawned like a gash on warrior's breast;
     Its trench had stayed full many a rock,
     Hurled by primeval earthquake shock
     From Benvenue's gray summit wild,
     And here, in random ruin piled,
     They frowned incumbent o'er the spot
     And formed the rugged sylvan "rot.
     The oak and birch with mingled shade
     At noontide there a twilight made,
     Unless when short and sudden shone
     Some straggling beam on cliff or stone,
     With such a glimpse as prophet's eye
     Gains on thy depth, Futurity.
     No murmur waked the solemn still,
     Save tinkling of a fountain rill;
     But when the wind chafed with the lake,
     A sullen sound would upward break,
     With dashing hollow voice, that spoke
     The incessant war of wave and rock.
     Suspended cliffs with hideous sway
     Seemed nodding o'er the cavern gray.
     From such a den the wolf had sprung,
     In such the wild-cat leaves her young;
     Yet Douglas and his daughter fair
     Sought for a space their safety there.
     Gray Superstition's whisper dread
     Debarred the spot to vulgar tread;
     For there, she said, did fays resort,
     And satyrs hold their sylvan court,
     By moonlight tread their mystic maze,
     And blast the rash beholder's gaze.


     XXVII.

     Now eve, with western shadows long,
     Floated on Katrine bright and strong,
     When Roderick with a chosen few
     Repassed the heights of Benvenue.
     Above the Goblin Cave they go,
     Through the wild pass of Beal-nam-bo;
     The prompt retainers speed before,
     To launch the shallop from the shore,
     For 'cross Loch Katrine lies his way
     To view the passes of Achray,
     And place his clansmen in array.
     Yet lags the Chief in musing mind,
     Unwonted sight, his men behind.
     A single page, to bear his sword,
     Alone attended on his lord;
     The rest their way through thickets break,
     And soon await him by the lake.
     It was a fair and gallant sight
     To view them from the neighboring height,
     By the low-levelled sunbeam's light!
     For strength and stature, from the clan
     Each warrior was a chosen man,
     As even afar might well be seen,
     By their proud step and martial mien.
     Their feathers dance, their tartars float,
     Their targets gleam, as by the boat
     A wild and warlike group they stand,
     That well became such mountain-strand.


     XXVI

     Their Chief with step reluctant still
     Was lingering on the craggy hill,
     Hard by where turned apart the road
     To Douglas's obscure abode.
     It was but with that dawning morn
     That Roderick Dhu had proudly sworn
     To drown his love in war's wild roar,
     Nor think of Ellen Douglas more;
     But he who stems a stream with sand,
     And fetters flame with flaxen band,
     Has yet a harder task to prove,--
     By firm resolve to conquer love!
     Eve finds the Chief, like restless ghost,
     Still hovering near his treasure lost;
     For though his haughty heart deny
     A parting meeting to his eye
     Still fondly strains his anxious ear
     The accents of her voice to hear,
     And inly did he curse the breeze
     That waked to sound the rustling trees.
     But hark! what mingles in the strain?
     It is the harp of Allan-bane,
     That wakes its measure slow and high,
     Attuned to sacred minstrelsy.
     What melting voice attends the strings?
     'Tis Ellen, or an angel, sings.


     XXIX.

     Hymn to the Virgin.

     Ave. Maria! maiden mild!
          Listen to a maiden's prayer!
     Thou canst hear though from the wild,
          Thou canst save amid despair.
     Safe may we sleep beneath thy care,
          Though banished, outcast, and reviled--
     Maiden! hear a maiden's prayer;
          Mother, hear a suppliant child!
                                              Ave Maria!

     Ave Maria! undefiled!
          The flinty couch we now must share
     Shall seem with down of eider piled,
          If thy protection hover there.
     The murky cavern's heavy air
          Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled;
     Then, Maiden! hear a maiden's prayer,
          Mother, list a suppliant child!
                                              Ave Maria!

     Ave. Maria! stainless styled!
          Foul demons of the earth and air,
     From this their wonted haunt exiled,
          Shall flee before thy presence fair.
     We bow us to our lot of care,
          Beneath thy guidance reconciled:
     Hear for a maid a maiden's prayer,
          And for a father hear a child!
                                              Ave Maria!


     XXX.

     Died on the harp the closing hymn,--
     Unmoved in attitude and limb,
     As listening still, Clan-Alpine's lord
     Stood leaning on his heavy sword,
     Until the page with humble sign
     Twice pointed to the sun's decline.
     Then while his plaid he round him cast,
     'It is the last time--'tis the last,'
     He muttered thrice,--'the last time e'er
     That angel-voice shall Roderick hear''
     It was a goading thought,--his stride
     Hied hastier down the mountain-side;
     Sullen he flung him in the boat
     An instant 'cross the lake it shot.
     They landed in that silvery bay,
     And eastward held their hasty way
     Till, with the latest beams of light,
     The band arrived on Lanrick height'
     Where mustered in the vale below
     Clan-Alpine's men in martial show.


     XXXI.

     A various scene the clansmen made:
     Some sat, some stood, some slowly strayed:
     But most, with mantles folded round,
     Were couched to rest upon the ground,
     Scarce to be known by curious eye
     From the deep heather where they lie,
     So well was matched the tartan screen
     With heath-bell dark and brackens green;
     Unless where, here and there, a blade
     Or lance's point a glimmer made,
     Like glow-worm twinkling through the shade.
     But when, advancing through the gloom,
     They saw the Chieftain's eagle plume,
     Their shout of welcome, shrill and wide,
     Shook the steep mountain's steady side.
     Thrice it arose, and lake and fell
     Three times returned the martial yell;
     It died upon Bochastle's plain,
     And Silence claimed her evening reign.




CANTO FOURTH.

The Prophecy.



     I.

     The rose is fairest when 't is budding new,
        And hope is brightest when it dawns from fears;
     The rose is sweetest washed with morning dew
        And love is loveliest when embalmed in tears.
     O wilding rose, whom fancy thus endears,
        I bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave,
     Emblem of hope and love through future years!'
        Thus spoke young Norman, heir of Armandave,
     What time the sun arose on Vennachar's broad wave.


     II.

     Such fond conceit, half said, half sung,
     Love prompted to the bridegroom's tongue.
     All while he stripped the wild-rose spray,
     His axe and bow beside him lay,
     For on a pass 'twixt lake and wood
     A wakeful sentinel he stood.
     Hark!--on the rock a footstep rung,
     And instant to his arms he sprung.
     'Stand, or thou diest!--What, Malise?--soon
     Art thou returned from Braes of Doune.
     By thy keen step and glance I know,
     Thou bring'st us tidings of the foe.'--
     For while the Fiery Cross tried on,
     On distant scout had Malise gone.--
     'Where sleeps the Chief?' the henchman said.
     'Apart, in yonder misty glade;
     To his lone couch I'll be your guide.'--
     Then called a slumberer by his side,
     And stirred him with his slackened bow,--
     'Up, up, Glentarkin! rouse thee, ho!
     We seek the Chieftain; on the track
     Keep eagle watch till I come back.'


     III.

     Together up the pass they sped:
     'What of the foeman?' Norman said.--
     'Varying reports from near and far;
     This certain,--that a band of war
     Has for two days been ready boune,
     At prompt command to march from Doune;
     King James the while, with princely powers,
     Holds revelry in Stirling towers.
     Soon will this dark and gathering cloud
     Speak on our glens in thunder loud.
     Inured to bide such bitter bout,
     The warrior's plaid may bear it out;
     But, Norman, how wilt thou provide
     A shelter for thy bonny bride?''--
     'What! know ye not that Roderick's care
     To the lone isle hath caused repair
     Each maid and matron of the clan,
     And every child and aged man
     Unfit for arms; and given his charge,
     Nor skiff nor shallop, boat nor barge,
     Upon these lakes shall float at large,
     But all beside the islet moor,
     That such dear pledge may rest secure?'--


     IV.

     ''T is well advised,--the Chieftain's plan
     Bespeaks the father of his clan.
     But wherefore sleeps Sir Roderick Dhu
     Apart from all his followers true?'
     'It is because last evening-tide
     Brian an augury hath tried,
     Of that dread kind which must not be
     Unless in dread extremity,
     The Taghairm called; by which, afar,
     Our sires foresaw the events of war.
     Duncraggan's milk-white bull they slew,'--

     Malise.

     'Ah! well the gallant brute I knew!
     The choicest of the prey we had
     When swept our merrymen Gallangad.
     His hide was snow, his horns were dark,
     His red eye glowed like fiery spark;
     So fierce, so tameless, and so fleet,
     Sore did he cumber our retreat,
     And kept our stoutest kerns in awe,
     Even at the pass of Beal 'maha.
     But steep and flinty was the road,
     And sharp the hurrying pikeman's goad,
     And when we came to Dennan's Row
     A child might scathless stroke his brow.'


     V.

     Norman.

     'That bull was slain; his reeking hide
     They stretched the cataract beside,
     Whose waters their wild tumult toss
     Adown the black and craggy boss
     Of that huge cliff whose ample verge
     Tradition calls the Hero's Targe.
     Couched on a shelf beneath its brink,
     Close where the thundering torrents sink,
     Rocking beneath their headlong sway,
     And drizzled by the ceaseless spray,
     Midst groan of rock and roar of stream,
     The wizard waits prophetic dream.
     Nor distant rests the Chief;--but hush!
     See, gliding slow through mist and bush,
     The hermit gains yon rock, and stands
     To gaze upon our slumbering bands.
     Seems he not, Malise, dike a ghost,
     That hovers o'er a slaughtered host?
     Or raven on the blasted oak,
     That, watching while the deer is broke,
     His morsel claims with sullen croak?'

     Malise.

     'Peace! peace! to other than to me
     Thy words were evil augury;
     But still I hold Sir Roderick's blade
     Clan-Alpine's omen and her aid,
     Not aught that, gleaned from heaven or hell,
     Yon fiend-begotten Monk can tell.
     The Chieftain joins him, see--and now
     Together they descend the brow.'


     VI.

     And, as they came, with Alpine's Lord
     The Hermit Monk held solemn word:--.
     'Roderick! it is a fearful strife,
     For man endowed with mortal life
     Whose shroud of sentient clay can still
     Feel feverish pang and fainting chill,
     Whose eye can stare in stony trance
     Whose hair can rouse like warrior's lance,
     'Tis hard for such to view, unfurled,
     The curtain of the future world.
     Yet, witness every quaking limb,
     My sunken pulse, mine eyeballs dim,
     My soul with harrowing anguish torn,
     This for my Chieftain have I borne!--
     The shapes that sought my fearful couch
     A human tongue may ne'er avouch;
     No mortal man--save he, who, bred
     Between the living and the dead,
     Is gifted beyond nature's law
     Had e'er survived to say he saw.
     At length the fateful answer came
     In characters of living flame!
     Not spoke in word, nor blazed in scroll,
     But borne and branded on my soul:--
     WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN'S LIFE,
     THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE.'


     VII.

     'Thanks, Brian, for thy zeal and care!
     Good is thine augury, and fair.
     Clan-Alpine ne'er in battle stood
     But first our broadswords tasted blood.
     A surer victim still I know,
     Self-offered to the auspicious blow:
     A spy has sought my land this morn,--
     No eve shall witness his return!
     My followers guard each pass's mouth,
     To east, to westward, and to south;
     Red Murdoch, bribed to be his guide,
     Has charge to lead his steps aside,
     Till in deep path or dingle brown
     He light on those shall bring him clown.
     But see, who comes his news to show!
     Malise! what tidings of the foe?'


     VIII.

     'At Doune, o'er many a spear and glaive
     Two Barons proud their banners wave.
     I saw the Moray's silver star,
     And marked the sable pale of Mar.'
     'By Alpine's soul, high tidings those!
     I love to hear of worthy foes.
     When move they on?' 'To-morrow's noon
     Will see them here for battle boune.'
     'Then shall it see a meeting stern!
     But, for the place,--say, couldst thou learn
     Nought of the friendly clans of Earn?
     Strengthened by them, we well might bide
     The battle on Benledi's side.
     Thou couldst not?--well! Clan-Alpine's men
     Shall man the Trosachs' shaggy glen;
     Within Loch Katrine's gorge we'll fight,
     All in our maids' and matrons' sight,
     Each for his hearth and household fire,
     Father for child, and son for sire Lover
     for maid beloved!--But why
     Is it the breeze affects mine eye?
     Or dost thou come, ill-omened tear!
     A messenger of doubt or fear?
     No! sooner may the Saxon lance
     Unfix Benledi from his stance,
     Than doubt or terror can pierce through
     The unyielding heart of Roderick Dhu!
     'tis stubborn as his trusty targe.
     Each to his post!--all know their charge.'
     The pibroch sounds, the bands advance,
     The broadswords gleam, the banners dance'
     Obedient to the Chieftain's glance.--
     I turn me from the martial roar
     And seek Coir-Uriskin once more.


     IX.

     Where is the Douglas?--he is gone;
     And Ellen sits on the gray stone
     Fast by the cave, and makes her moan,
     While vainly Allan's words of cheer
     Are poured on her unheeding ear.
     'He will return--dear lady, trust!--
     With joy return;--he will--he must.
     Well was it time to seek afar
     Some refuge from impending war,
     When e'en Clan-Alpine's rugged swarm
     Are cowed by the approaching storm.
     I saw their boats with many a light,
     Floating the livelong yesternight,
     Shifting like flashes darted forth
     By the red streamers of the north;
     I marked at morn how close they ride,
     Thick moored by the lone islet's side,
     Like wild ducks couching in the fen
     When stoops the hawk upon the glen.
     Since this rude race dare not abide
     The peril on the mainland side,
     Shall not thy noble father's care
     Some safe retreat for thee prepare?'


     X.

     Ellen.

     'No, Allan, no' Pretext so kind
     My wakeful terrors could not blind.
     When in such tender tone, yet grave,
     Douglas a parting blessing gave,
     The tear that glistened in his eye
     Drowned not his purpose fixed and high.
     My soul, though feminine and weak,
     Can image his; e'en as the lake,
     Itself disturbed by slightest stroke.
     Reflects the invulnerable rock.
     He hears report of battle rife,
     He deems himself the cause of strife.
     I saw him redden when the theme
     Turned, Allan, on thine idle dream
     Of Malcolm Graeme in fetters bound,
     Which I, thou saidst, about him wound.
     Think'st thou he bowed thine omen aught?
     O no' 't was apprehensive thought
     For the kind youth,--for Roderick too--
     Let me be just--that friend so true;
     In danger both, and in our cause!
     Minstrel, the Douglas dare not pause.
     Why else that solemn warning given,
     'If not on earth, we meet in heaven!'
     Why else, to Cambus-kenneth's fane,
     If eve return him not again,
     Am I to hie and make me known?
     Alas! he goes to Scotland's throne,
     Buys his friends' safety with his own;
     He goes to do--what I had done,
     Had Douglas' daughter been his son!'


     XI.

     'Nay, lovely Ellen!--dearest, nay!
     If aught should his return delay,
     He only named yon holy fane
     As fitting place to meet again.
     Be sure he's safe; and for the Graeme,--
     Heaven's blessing on his gallant name!--
     My visioned sight may yet prove true,
     Nor bode of ill to him or you.
     When did my gifted dream beguile?
     Think of the stranger at the isle,
     And think upon the harpings slow
     That presaged this approaching woe!
     Sooth was my prophecy of fear;
     Believe it when it augurs cheer.
     Would we had left this dismal spot!
     Ill luck still haunts a fairy spot!
     Of such a wondrous tale I know--
     Dear lady, change that look of woe,
     My harp was wont thy grief to cheer.'

     Ellen.

     'Well, be it as thou wilt;
     I hear, But cannot stop the bursting tear.'
     The Minstrel tried his simple art,
     Rut distant far was Ellen's heart.


     XII.

     Ballad.

     Alice Brand.

     Merry it is in the good greenwood,
          When the mavis and merle are singing,
     When the deer sweeps by, and the hounds are in cry,
          And the hunter's horn is ringing.

     'O Alice Brand, my native land
          Is lost for love of you;
     And we must hold by wood and word,
          As outlaws wont to do.

     'O Alice, 't was all for thy locks so bright,
          And 't was all for thine eyes so blue,
     That on the night of our luckless flight
          Thy brother bold I slew.

     'Now must I teach to hew the beech
          The hand that held the glaive,
     For leaves to spread our lowly bed,
          And stakes to fence our cave.

     'And for vest of pall, thy fingers small,
          That wont on harp to stray,
     A cloak must shear from the slaughtered deer,
          To keep the cold away.'

     'O Richard! if my brother died,
          'T was but a fatal chance;
     For darkling was the battle tried,
          And fortune sped the lance.

     'If pall and vair no more I wear,
          Nor thou the crimson sheen
     As warm, we'll say, is the russet gray,
          As gay the forest-green.

     'And, Richard, if our lot be hard,
          And lost thy native land,
     Still Alice has her own Richard,
          And he his Alice Brand.'


     XIII.

     Ballad Continued.

     'tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood;
          So blithe Lady Alice is singing;
     On the beech's pride, and oak's brown side,
          Lord Richard's axe is ringing.

     Up spoke the moody Elfin King,
          Who woned within the hill,--
     Like wind in the porch of a ruined church,
          His voice was ghostly shrill.

     'Why sounds yon stroke on beech and oak,
          Our moonlight circle's screen?
     Or who comes here to chase the deer,
          Beloved of our Elfin Queen?
     Or who may dare on wold to wear
          The fairies' fatal green?

     'Up, Urgan, up! to yon mortal hie,
          For thou wert christened man;
     For cross or sign thou wilt not fly,
          For muttered word or ban.

     'Lay on him the curse of the withered heart,
          The curse of the sleepless eye;
     Till he wish and pray that his life would part,
          Nor yet find leave to die.'


     XIV.

     Ballad Continued.

     'Tis merry, 'tis merry, in good greenwood,
          Though the birds have stilled their singing;
     The evening blaze cloth Alice raise,
          And Richard is fagots bringing.

     Up Urgan starts, that hideous dwarf,
          Before Lord Richard stands,
     And, as he crossed and blessed himself,
          'I fear not sign,' quoth the grisly elf,
               'That is made with bloody hands.'

     But out then spoke she, Alice Brand,
          That woman void of fear,--
     'And if there 's blood upon his hand,
          'Tis but the blood of deer.'

     'Now loud thou liest, thou bold of mood!
          It cleaves unto his hand,
     The stain of thine own kindly blood,
          The blood of Ethert Brand.'

     Then forward stepped she, Alice Brand,
          And made the holy sign,--
     'And if there's blood on Richard's hand,
          A spotless hand is mine.

     'And I conjure thee, demon elf,
          By Him whom demons fear,
     To show us whence thou art thyself,
          And what thine errand here?'


     XV.

     Ballad Continued.

     "Tis merry, 'tis merry, in Fairy-land,
          When fairy birds are singing,
     When the court cloth ride by their monarch's side,
          With bit and bridle ringing:

     'And gayly shines the Fairy-land--
          But all is glistening show,
     Like the idle gleam that December's beam
          Can dart on ice and snow.

     'And fading, like that varied gleam,
          Is our inconstant shape,
     Who now like knight and lady seem,
          And now like dwarf and ape.

     'It was between the night and day,
          When the Fairy King has power,
     That I sunk down in a sinful fray,
     And 'twixt life and death was snatched away
          To the joyless Elfin bower.

     'But wist I of a woman bold,
          Who thrice my brow durst sign,
     I might regain my mortal mould,
          As fair a form as thine.'

     She crossed him once--she crossed him twice--
          That lady was so brave;
     The fouler grew his goblin hue,
          The darker grew the cave.

     She crossed him thrice, that lady bold;
          He rose beneath her hand
     The fairest knight on Scottish mould,
          Her brother, Ethert Brand!

     Merry it is in good greenwood,
          When the mavis and merle are singing,
     But merrier were they in Dunfermline gray,
          When all the bells were ringing.


     XVI.

     Just as the minstrel sounds were stayed,
     A stranger climbed the steepy glade;
     His martial step, his stately mien,
     His hunting-suit of Lincoln green,
     His eagle glance, remembrance claims--
     'Tis Snowdoun's Knight, 'tis James Fitz-James.
     Ellen beheld as in a dream,
     Then, starting, scarce suppressed a scream:
     'O stranger! in such hour of fear
     What evil hap has brought thee here?'
     'An evil hap how can it be
     That bids me look again on thee?
     By promise bound, my former guide
     Met me betimes this morning-tide,
     And marshalled over bank and bourne
     The happy path of my return.'
     'The happy path!--what! said he naught
     Of war, of battle to be fought,
     Of guarded pass?' 'No, by my faith!
     Nor saw I aught could augur scathe.'
     'O haste thee, Allan, to the kern:
     Yonder his tartars I discern;
     Learn thou his purpose, and conjure
     That he will guide the stranger sure!--
     What prompted thee, unhappy man?
     The meanest serf in Roderick's clan
     Had not been bribed, by love or fear,
     Unknown to him to guide thee here.'


     XVII.

     'Sweet Ellen, dear my life must be,
     Since it is worthy care from thee;
     Yet life I hold but idle breath
     When love or honor's weighed with death.
     Then let me profit by my chance,
     And speak my purpose bold at once.
     I come to bear thee from a wild
     Where ne'er before such blossom smiled,
     By this soft hand to lead thee far
     From frantic scenes of feud and war.
     Near Bochastle my horses wait;
     They bear us soon to Stirling gate.
     I'll place thee in a lovely bower,
     I'll guard thee like a tender flower--'
     'O hush, Sir Knight! 't were female art,
     To say I do not read thy heart;
     Too much, before, my selfish ear
     Was idly soothed my praise to hear.
     That fatal bait hath lured thee back,
     In deathful hour, o'er dangerous track;
     And how, O how, can I atone
     The wreck my vanity brought on!--
     One way remains--I'll tell him all--
     Yes! struggling bosom, forth it shall!
     Thou, whose light folly bears the blame,
     Buy thine own pardon with thy shame!
     But first--my father is a man
     Outlawed and exiled, under ban;
     The price of blood is on his head,
     With me 't were infamy to wed.
     Still wouldst thou speak?--then hear the truth!
     Fitz-James, there is a noble youth--
     If yet he is!--exposed for me
     And mine to dread extremity--
     Thou hast the secret of my bears;
     Forgive, be generous, and depart!'


     XVIII.

     Fitz-James knew every wily train
     A lady's fickle heart to gain,
     But here he knew and felt them vain.
     There shot no glance from Ellen's eye,
     To give her steadfast speech the lie;
     In maiden confidence she stood,
     Though mantled in her cheek the blood
     And told her love with such a sigh
     Of deep and hopeless agony,
     As death had sealed her Malcolm's doom
     And she sat sorrowing on his tomb.
     Hope vanished from Fitz-James's eye,
     But not with hope fled sympathy.
     He proffered to attend her side,
     As brother would a sister guide.
     'O little know'st thou Roderick's heart!
     Safer for both we go apart.
     O haste thee, and from Allan learn
     If thou mayst trust yon wily kern.'
     With hand upon his forehead laid,
     The conflict of his mind to shade,
     A parting step or two he made;
     Then, as some thought had crossed his brain
     He paused, and turned, and came again.


     XIX.

     'Hear, lady, yet a parting word!--
     It chanced in fight that my poor sword
     Preserved the life of Scotland's lord.
     This ring the grateful Monarch gave,
     And bade, when I had boon to crave,
     To bring it back, and boldly claim
     The recompense that I would name.
     Ellen, I am no courtly lord,
     But one who lives by lance and sword,
     Whose castle is his helm and shield,
     His lordship the embattled field.
     What from a prince can I demand,
     Who neither reck of state nor land?
     Ellen, thy hand--the ring is thine;
     Each guard and usher knows the sign.
     Seek thou the King without delay;
     This signet shall secure thy way:
     And claim thy suit, whate'er it be,
     As ransom of his pledge to me.'
     He placed the golden circlet on,
     Paused--kissed her hand--and then was gone.
     The aged Minstrel stood aghast,
     So hastily Fitz-James shot past.
     He joined his guide, and wending down
     The ridges of the mountain brown,
     Across the stream they took their way
     That joins Loch Katrine to Achray.


     XX

     All in the Trosachs' glen was still,
     Noontide was sleeping on the hill:
     Sudden his guide whooped loud and high--
     'Murdoch! was that a signal cry?'--
     He stammered forth, 'I shout to scare
     Yon raven from his dainty fare.'
     He looked--he knew the raven's prey,
     His own brave steed: 'Ah! gallant gray!
     For thee--for me, perchance--'t were well
     We ne'er had seen the Trosachs' dell.--
     Murdoch, move first---but silently;
     Whistle or whoop, and thou shalt die!'
     Jealous and sullen on they fared,
     Each silent, each upon his guard.


     XXI.

     Now wound the path its dizzy ledge
     Around a precipice's edge,
     When lo! a wasted female form,
     Blighted by wrath of sun and storm,
     In tattered weeds and wild array,
     Stood on a cliff beside the way,
     And glancing round her restless eye,
     Upon the wood, the rock, the sky,
     Seemed naught to mark, yet all to spy.
     Her brow was wreathed with gaudy broom;
     With gesture wild she waved a plume
     Of feathers, which the eagles fling
     To crag and cliff from dusky wing;
     Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
     Where scarce was footing for the goat.
     The tartan plaid she first descried,
     And shrieked till all the rocks replied;
     As loud she laughed when near they drew,
     For then the Lowland garb she knew;
     And then her hands she wildly wrung,
     And then she wept, and then she sung--
     She sung!--the voice, in better time,
     Perchance to harp or lute might chime;
     And now, though strained and roughened, still
     Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.


     XXII.

     Song.

     They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,
          They say my brain is warped and wrung--
     I cannot sleep on Highland brae,
          I cannot pray in Highland tongue.
     But were I now where Allan glides,
     Or heard my native Devan's tides,
     So sweetly would I rest, and pray
     That Heaven would close my wintry day!

     'Twas thus my hair they bade me braid,
          They made me to the church repair;
     It was my bridal morn they said,
          And my true love would meet me there.
     But woe betide the cruel guile
     That drowned in blood the morning smile!
     And woe betide the fairy dream!
     I only waked to sob and scream.


     XXIII.

     'Who is this maid? what means her lay?
     She hovers o'er the hollow way,
     And flutters wide her mantle gray,
     As the lone heron spreads his wing,
     By twilight, o'er a haunted spring.'
     ''Tis Blanche of Devan,' Murdoch said,
     'A crazed and captive Lowland maid,
     Ta'en on the morn she was a bride,
     When Roderick forayed Devan-side.
     The gay bridegroom resistance made,
     And felt our Chief's unconquered blade.
     I marvel she is now at large,
     But oft she 'scapes from Maudlin's charge.--
     Hence, brain-sick fool!'--He raised his bow:--
     'Now, if thou strik'st her but one blow,
     I'll pitch thee from the cliff as far
     As ever peasant pitched a bar!'
     'Thanks, champion, thanks' the Maniac cried,
     And pressed her to Fitz-James's side.
     'See the gray pennons I prepare,
     To seek my true love through the air!
     I will not lend that savage groom,
     To break his fall, one downy plume!
     No!--deep amid disjointed stones,
     The wolves shall batten on his bones,
     And then shall his detested plaid,
     By bush and brier in mid-air stayed,
     Wave forth a banner fail and free,
     Meet signal for their revelry.'


     XXIV

     'Hush thee, poor maiden, and be still!'
     'O! thou look'st kindly, and I will.
     Mine eye has dried and wasted been,
     But still it loves the Lincoln green;
     And, though mine ear is all unstrung,
     Still, still it loves the Lowland tongue.

     'For O my sweet William was forester true,
          He stole poor Blanche's heart away!
     His coat it was all of the greenwood hue,
          And so blithely he trilled the Lowland lay!

     'It was not that I meant to tell...
     But thou art wise and guessest well.'
     Then, in a low and broken tone,
     And hurried note, the song went on.
     Still on the Clansman fearfully
     She fixed her apprehensive eye,
     Then turned it on the Knight, and then
     Her look glanced wildly o'er the glen.


     XXV.

     'The toils are pitched, and the stakes are set,--
          Ever sing merrily, merrily;
     The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
          Hunters live so cheerily.

     It was a stag, a stag of ten,
          Bearing its branches sturdily;
     He came stately down the glen,--
          Ever sing hardily, hardily.

     'It was there he met with a wounded doe,
          She was bleeding deathfully;
     She warned him of the toils below,
          O. so faithfully, faithfully!

     'He had an eye, and he could heed,--
          Ever sing warily, warily;
     He had a foot, and he could speed,--
          Hunters watch so narrowly.'


     XXVI.

     Fitz-James's mind was passion-tossed,
     When Ellen's hints and fears were lost;
     But Murdoch's shout suspicion wrought,
     And Blanche's song conviction brought.
     Not like a stag that spies the snare,
     But lion of the hunt aware,
     He waved at once his blade on high,
     'Disclose thy treachery, or die!'
     Forth at hell speed the Clansman flew,
     But in his race his bow he drew.
     The shaft just grazed Fitz-James's crest,
     And thrilled in Blanche's faded breast.--
     Murdoch of Alpine! prove thy speed,
     For ne'er had Alpine's son such need;
     With heart of fire, and foot of wind,
     The fierce avenger is behind!
     Fate judges of the rapid strife--
     The forfeit death--the prize is life;
     Thy kindred ambush lies before,
     Close couched upon the heathery moor;
     Them couldst thou reach!--it may not be
     Thine ambushed kin thou ne'er shalt see,
     The fiery Saxon gains on thee!--
     Resistless speeds the deadly thrust,
     As lightning strikes the pine to dust;
     With foot and hand Fitz-James must strain
     Ere he can win his blade again.
     Bent o'er the fallen with falcon eye,
     He grimly smiled to see him die,
     Then slower wended back his way,
     Where the poor maiden bleeding lay.


     XXVII.

     She sat beneath the birchen tree,
     Her elbow resting on her knee;
     She had withdrawn the fatal shaft,
     And gazed on it, and feebly laughed;
     Her wreath of broom and feathers gray,
     Daggled with blood, beside her lay.
     The Knight to stanch the life-stream tried,--
     'Stranger, it is in vain!' she cried.
     'This hour of death has given me more
     Of reason's power than years before;
     For, as these ebbing veins decay,
     My frenzied visions fade away.
     A helpless injured wretch I die,
     And something tells me in thine eye
     That thou wert mine avenger born.
     Seest thou this tress?--O. still I 've worn
     This little tress of yellow hair,
     Through danger, frenzy, and despair!
     It once was bright and clear as thine,
     But blood and tears have dimmed its shine.
     I will not tell thee when 't was shred,
     Nor from what guiltless victim's head,--
     My brain would turn!--but it shall wave
     Like plumage on thy helmet brave,
     Till sun and wind shall bleach the stain,
     And thou wilt bring it me again.
     I waver still.--O God! more bright
     Let reason beam her parting light!--
     O. by thy knighthood's honored sign,
     And for thy life preserved by mine,
     When thou shalt see a darksome man,
     Who boasts him Chief of Alpine's Clan,
     With tartars broad and shadowy plume,
     And hand of blood, and brow of gloom
     Be thy heart bold, thy weapon strong,
     And wreak poor Blanche of Devan's wrong!--
     They watch for thee by pass and fell...
     Avoid the path... O God!... farewell.'


     XXVIII.

     A kindly heart had brave Fitz-James;
     Fast poured his eyes at pity's claims;
     And now, with mingled grief and ire,
     He saw the murdered maid expire.
     'God, in my need, be my relief,
     As I wreak this on yonder Chief!'
     A lock from Blanche's tresses fair
     He blended with her bridegroom's hair;
     The mingled braid in blood he dyed,
     And placed it on his bonnet-side:
     'By Him whose word is truth, I swear,
     No other favour will I wear,
     Till this sad token I imbrue
     In the best blood of Roderick Dhu!--
     But hark! what means yon faint halloo?
     The chase is up,--but they shall know,
     The stag at bay 's a dangerous foe.'
     Barred from the known but guarded way,
     Through copse and cliffs Fitz-James must stray,
     And oft must change his desperate track,
     By stream and precipice turned back.
     Heartless, fatigued, and faint, at length,
     From lack of food and loss of strength
     He couched him in a thicket hoar
     And thought his toils and perils o'er:--
     'Of all my rash adventures past,
     This frantic feat must prove the last!
     Who e'er so mad but might have guessed
     That all this Highland hornet's nest
     Would muster up in swarms so soon
     As e'er they heard of bands at Doune?--
     Like bloodhounds now they search me out,--
     Hark, to the whistle and the shout!--
     If farther through the wilds I go,
     I only fall upon the foe:
     I'll couch me here till evening gray,
     Then darkling try my dangerous way.'


     XXIX.

     The shades of eve come slowly down,
     The woods are wrapt in deeper brown,
     The owl awakens from her dell,
     The fox is heard upon the fell;
     Enough remains of glimmering light
     To guide the wanderer's steps aright,
     Yet not enough from far to show
     His figure to the watchful foe.
     With cautious step and ear awake,
     He climbs the crag and threads the brake;
     And not the summer solstice there
     Tempered the midnight mountain air,
     But every breeze that swept the wold
     Benumbed his drenched limbs with cold.
     In dread, in danger, and alone,
     Famished and chilled, through ways unknown,
     Tangled and steep, he journeyed on;
     Till, as a rock's huge point he turned,
     A watch-fire close before him burned.


     XXX.

     Beside its embers red and clear
     Basked in his plaid a mountaineer;
     And up he sprung with sword in hand,--
     'Thy name and purpose! Saxon, stand!'
     'A stranger.' 'What dost thou require?'
     'Rest and a guide, and food and fire
     My life's beset, my path is lost,
     The gale has chilled my limbs with frost.'
     'Art thou a friend to Roderick?' 'No.'
     'Thou dar'st not call thyself a foe?'
     'I dare! to him and all the band
     He brings to aid his murderous hand.'
     'Bold words!--but, though the beast of game
     The privilege of chase may claim,
     Though space and law the stag we lend
     Ere hound we slip or bow we bend
     Who ever recked, where, how, or when,
     The prowling fox was trapped or slain?
     Thus treacherous scouts,--yet sure they lie
     Who say thou cam'st a secret spy!'--
     'They do, by heaven!--come Roderick Dhu
     And of his clan the boldest two
     And let me but till morning rest,
     I write the falsehood on their crest.'
     If by the blaze I mark aright
     Thou bear'st the belt and spur of Knight.'
     'Then by these tokens mayst thou know
     Each proud oppressor's mortal foe.'
     'Enough, enough; sit down and share
     A soldier's couch, a soldier's fare.'


     XXXI..

     He gave him of his Highland cheer,
     The hardened flesh of mountain deer;
     Dry fuel on the fire he laid,
     And bade the Saxon share his plaid.
     He tended him like welcome guest,
     Then thus his further speech addressed:--
     'Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
     A clansman born, a kinsman true;
     Each word against his honour spoke
     Demands of me avenging stroke;
     Yet more,--upon thy fate, 'tis said,
     A mighty augury is laid.
     It rests with me to wind my horn,--
     Thou art with numbers overborne;
     It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
     Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand:
     But, not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
     Will I depart from honour's laws;
     To assail a wearied man were shame,
     And stranger is a holy name;
     Guidance and rest, and food and fire,
     In vain he never must require.
     Then rest thee here till dawn of day;
     Myself will guide thee on the way,
     O'er stock and stone, through watch and ward,
     Till past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard,
     As far as Coilantogle's ford;
     From thence thy warrant is thy sword.'
     'I take thy courtesy, by heaven,
     As freely as 'tis nobly given!'
     Well, rest thee; for the bittern's cry
     Sings us the lake's wild lullaby.'
     With that he shook the gathered heath,
     And spread his plaid upon the wreath;
     And the brave foemen, side by side,
     Lay peaceful down like brothers tried,
     And slept until the dawning beam
     Purpled the mountain and the stream.




CANTO FIFTH.

The Combat.



     I.

     Fair as the earliest beam of eastern light,
          When first, by the bewildered pilgrim spied,
     It smiles upon the dreary brow of night
          And silvers o'er the torrent's foaming tide
     And lights the fearful path on mountain-side,--
          Fair as that beam, although the fairest far,
     Giving to horror grace, to danger pride,
          Shine martial Faith, and Courtesy's bright star
     Through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of War.


     II.

     That early beam, so fair and sheen,
     Was twinkling through the hazel screen
     When, rousing at its glimmer red,
     The warriors left their lowly bed,
     Looked out upon the dappled sky,
     Muttered their soldier matins try,
     And then awaked their fire, to steal,
     As short and rude, their soldier meal.
     That o'er, the Gael around him threw
     His graceful plaid of varied hue,
     And, true to promise, led the way,
     By thicket green and mountain gray.
     A wildering path!--they winded now
     Along the precipice's brow,
     Commanding the rich scenes beneath,
     The windings of the Forth and Teith,
     And all the vales between that lie.
     Till Stirling's turrets melt in sky;
     Then, sunk in copse, their farthest glance
     Gained not the length of horseman's lance.
     'Twas oft so steep, the foot was as fain
     Assistance from the hand to gain;
     So tangled oft that, bursting through,
     Each hawthorn shed her showers of dew,--
     That diamond dew, so pure and clear,
     It rivals all but Beauty's tear!


     III.

     At length they came where, stern and steep,
     The hill sinks down upon the deep.
     Here Vennachar in silver flows,
     There, ridge on ridge, Benledi rose;
     Ever the hollow path twined on,
     Beneath steep hank and threatening stone;
     A hundred men might hold the post
     With hardihood against a host.
     The rugged mountain's scanty cloak
     Was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak
     With shingles bare, and cliffs between
     And patches bright of bracken green,
     And heather black, that waved so high,
     It held the copse in rivalry.
     But where the lake slept deep and still
     Dank osiers fringed the swamp and hill;
     And oft both path and hill were torn
     Where wintry torrent down had borne
     And heaped upon the cumbered land
     Its wreck of gravel, rocks, and sand.
     So toilsome was the road to trace
     The guide, abating of his pace,
     Led slowly through the pass's jaws
     And asked Fitz-James by what strange cause
     He sought these wilds, traversed by few
     Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.


     IV.

     'Brave Gael, my pass, in danger tried
     Hangs in my belt and by my side
     Yet, sooth to tell,' the Saxon said,
     'I dreamt not now to claim its aid.
     When here, but three days since,
     I came Bewildered in pursuit of game,
     All seemed as peaceful and as still
     As the mist slumbering on yon hill;
     Thy dangerous Chief was then afar,
     Nor soon expected back from war.
     Thus said, at least, my mountain-guide,
     Though deep perchance the villain lied.'
     'Yet why a second venture try?'
     'A warrior thou, and ask me why!--
     Moves our free course by such fixed cause
     As gives the poor mechanic laws?
     Enough, I sought to drive away
     The lazy hours of peaceful day;
     Slight cause will then suffice to guide
     A Knight's free footsteps far and wide,--
     A falcon flown, a greyhound strayed,
     The merry glance of mountain maid;
     Or, if a path be dangerous known,
     The danger's self is lure alone.'


     V.

     'Thy secret keep, I urge thee not;--
     Yet, ere again ye sought this spot,
     Say, heard ye naught of Lowland war,
     Against Clan-Alpine, raised by Mar?'
     'No, by my word;--of bands prepared
     To guard King James's sports I heard;
     Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
     This muster of the mountaineer,
     Their pennons will abroad be flung,
     Which else in Doune had peaceful hung.'
     'Free be they flung! for we were loath
     Their silken folds should feast the moth.
     Free be they flung!--as free shall wave
     Clan-Alpine's pine in banner brave.
     But, stranger, peaceful since you came,
     Bewildered in the mountain-game,
     Whence the bold boast by which you show
     Vich-Alpine's vowed and mortal foe?'
     'Warrior, but yester-morn I knew
     Naught of thy Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
     Save as an outlawed desperate man,
     The chief of a rebellious clan,
     Who, in the Regent's court and sight,
     With ruffian dagger stabbed a knight;
     Yet this alone might from his part
     Sever each true and loyal heart.'


     VI.

     Wrathful at such arraignment foul,
     Dark lowered the clansman's sable scowl.
     A space he paused, then sternly said,
     'And heardst thou why he drew his blade?
     Heardst thou that shameful word and blow
     Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?
     What recked the Chieftain if he stood
     On Highland heath or Holy-Rood?
     He rights such wrong where it is given,
     If it were in the court of heaven.'
     'Still was it outrage;--yet, 'tis true,
     Not then claimed sovereignty his due;
     While Albany with feeble hand
     Held borrowed truncheon of command,
     The young King, mewed in Stirling tower,
     Was stranger to respect and power.
     But then, thy Chieftain's robber life!--
     Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
     Wrenching from ruined Lowland swain
     His herds and harvest reared in vain,--
     Methinks a soul like thine should scorn
     The spoils from such foul foray borne.'


     VII.

     The Gael beheld him grim the while,
     And answered with disdainful smile:
     'Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
     I marked thee send delighted eye
     Far to the south and east, where lay,
     Extended in succession gay,
     Deep waving fields and pastures green,
     With gentle slopes and groves between:--
     These fertile plains, that softened vale,
     Were once the birthright of the Gael;
     The stranger came with iron hand,
     And from our fathers reft the land.
     Where dwell we now?  See, rudely swell
     Crag over crag, and fell o'er fell.
     Ask we this savage hill we tread
     For fattened steer or household bread,
     Ask we for flocks these shingles dry,
     And well the mountain might reply,--
     "To you, as to your sires of yore,
     Belong the target and claymore!
     I give you shelter in my breast,
     Your own good blades must win the rest."
     Pent in this fortress of the North,
     Think'st thou we will not sally forth,
     To spoil the spoiler as we may,
     And from the robber rend the prey?
     Ay, by my soul!--While on yon plain
     The Saxon rears one shock of grain,
     While of ten thousand herds there strays
     But one along yon river's maze,--
     The Gael, of plain and river heir,
     Shall with strong hand redeem his share.
     Where live the mountain Chiefs who hold
     That plundering Lowland field and fold
     Is aught but retribution true?
     Seek other cause 'gainst Roderick Dhu.'


     VIII.

     Answered Fitz-James: 'And, if I sought,
     Think'st thou no other could be brought?
     What deem ye of my path waylaid?
     My life given o'er to ambuscade?'
     'As of a meed to rashness due:
     Hadst thou sent warning fair and true,--
     I seek my hound or falcon strayed,
     I seek, good faith, a Highland maid,--
     Free hadst thou been to come and go;
     But secret path marks secret foe.
     Nor yet for this, even as a spy,
     Hadst thou, unheard, been doomed to die,
     Save to fulfil an augury.'
     'Well, let it pass; nor will I now
     Fresh cause of enmity avow
     To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.
     Enough, I am by promise tied
     To match me with this man of pride:
     Twice have I sought Clan-Alpine's glen
     In peace; but when I come again,
     I come with banner, brand, and bow,
     As leader seeks his mortal foe.
     For love-lore swain in lady's bower
     Ne'er panted for the appointed hour
     As I, until before me stand
     This rebel Chieftain and his band!'


     IX.

     'Have then thy wish!'--He whistled shrill
     And he was answered from the hill;
     Wild as the scream of the curlew,
     From crag to crag the signal flew.
     Instant, through copse and heath, arose
     Bonnets and spears and bended bows
     On right, on left, above, below,
     Sprung up at once the lurking foe;
     From shingles gray their lances start,
     The bracken bush sends forth the dart,
     The rushes and the willow-wand
     Are bristling into axe and brand,
     And every tuft of broom gives life
     'To plaided warrior armed for strife.
     That whistle garrisoned the glen
     At once with full five hundred men,
     As if the yawning hill to heaven
     A subterranean host had given.
     Watching their leader's beck and will,
     All silent there they stood and still.
     Like the loose crags whose threatening mass
     Lay tottering o'er the hollow pass,
     As if an infant's touch could urge
     Their headlong passage down the verge,
     With step and weapon forward flung,
     Upon the mountain-side they hung.
     The Mountaineer cast glance of pride
     Along Benledi's living side,
     Then fixed his eye and sable brow
     Full on Fitz-James: 'How say'st thou now?
     These are Clan-Alpine's warriors true;
     And, Saxon,--I am Roderick Dhu!'


     X.

     Fitz-James was brave:--though to his heart
     The life-blood thrilled with sudden start,
     He manned himself with dauntless air,
     Returned the Chief his haughty stare,
     His back against a rock he bore,
     And firmly placed his foot before:--
     'Come one, come all! this rock shall fly
     From its firm base as soon as I.'
     Sir Roderick marked,--and in his eyes
     Respect was mingled with surprise,
     And the stern joy which warriors feel
     In foeman worthy of their steel.
     Short space he stood--then waved his hand:
     Down sunk the disappearing band;
     Each warrior vanished where he stood,
     In broom or bracken, heath or wood;
     Sunk brand and spear and bended bow,
     In osiers pale and copses low;
     It seemed as if their mother Earth
     Had swallowed up her warlike birth.
     The wind's last breath had tossed in air
     Pennon and plaid and plumage fair,--
     The next but swept a lone hill-side
     Where heath and fern were waving wide:
     The sun's last glance was glinted back
     From spear and glaive, from targe and jack,--
     The next, all unreflected, shone
     On bracken green and cold gray stone.


     XI.

     Fitz-James looked round,--yet scarce believed
     The witness that his sight received;
     Such apparition well might seem
     Delusion of a dreadful dream.
     Sir Roderick in suspense he eyed,
     And to his look the Chief replied:
     'Fear naught--nay, that I need not say
     But--doubt not aught from mine array.
     Thou art my guest;--I pledged my word
     As far as Coilantogle ford:
     Nor would I call a clansman's brand
     For aid against one valiant hand,
     Though on our strife lay every vale
     Rent by the Saxon from the Gael.
     So move we on;--I only meant
     To show the reed on which you leant,
     Deeming this path you might pursue
     Without a pass from Roderick Dhu.'
     They moved;--I said Fitz-James was brave
     As ever knight that belted glaive,
     Yet dare not say that now his blood
     Kept on its wont and tempered flood,
     As, following Roderick's stride, he drew
     That seeming lonesome pathway through,
     Which yet by fearful proof was rife
     With lances, that, to take his life,
     Waited but signal from a guide,
     So late dishonored and defied.
     Ever, by stealth, his eye sought round
     The vanished guardians of the ground,
     And stir'd from copse and heather deep
     Fancy saw spear and broadsword peep,
     And in the plover's shrilly strain
     The signal whistle heard again.
     Nor breathed he free till far behind
     The pass was left; for then they wind
     Along a wide and level green,
     Where neither tree nor tuft was seen,
     Nor rush nor bush of broom was near,
     To hide a bonnet or a spear.


     XII.

     The Chief in silence strode before,
     And reached that torrent's sounding shore,
     Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,
     From Vennachar in silver breaks,
     Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines
     On Bochastle the mouldering lines,
     Where Rome, the Empress of the world,
     Of yore her eagle wings unfurled.
     And here his course the Chieftain stayed,
     Threw down his target and his plaid,
     And to the Lowland warrior said:
     'Bold Saxon! to his promise just,
     Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust.
     This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,
     This head of a rebellious clan,
     Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,
     Far past Clan-Alpine's outmost guard.
     Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
     A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel.
     See, here all vantageless I stand,
     Armed like thyself with single brand;
     For this is Coilantogle ford,
     And thou must keep thee with thy sword.'


     XIII.

     The Saxon paused: 'I ne'er delayed,
     When foeman bade me draw my blade;
     Nay more, brave Chief, I vowed thy death;
     Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
     And my deep debt for life preserved,
     A better meed have well deserved:
     Can naught but blood our feud atone?
     Are there no means?'--' No, stranger, none!
     And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--
     The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
     For thus spoke Fate by prophet bred
     Between the living and the dead:"
     Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
     His party conquers in the strife."'
     'Then, by my word,' the Saxon said,
     "The riddle is already read.
     Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--
     There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.
     Thus Fate hath solved her prophecy;
     Then yield to Fate, and not to me.
     To James at Stirling let us go,
     When, if thou wilt be still his foe,
     Or if the King shall not agree
     To grant thee grace and favor free,
     I plight mine honor, oath, and word
     That, to thy native strengths restored,
     With each advantage shalt thou stand
     That aids thee now to guard thy land.'


     XIV.

     Dark lightning flashed from Roderick's eye:
     'Soars thy presumption, then, so high,
     Because a wretched kern ye slew,
     Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?
     He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!
     Thou add'st but fuel to my hate;--
     My clansman's blood demands revenge.
     Not yet prepared?--By heaven, I change
     My thought, and hold thy valor light
     As that of some vain carpet knight,
     Who ill deserved my courteous care,
     And whose best boast is but to wear
     A braid of his fair lady's hair.' 'I thank thee,
     Roderick, for the word!
     It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;
     For I have sworn this braid to stain
     In the best blood that warms thy vein.
     Now, truce, farewell! and, rush, begone!--
     Yet think not that by thee alone,
     Proud Chief! can courtesy be shown;
     Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
     Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
     Of this small horn one feeble blast
     Would fearful odds against thee cast.
     But fear not--doubt not--which thou wilt--
     We try this quarrel hilt to hilt.'
     Then each at once his falchion drew,
     Each on the ground his scabbard threw
     Each looked to sun and stream and plain
     As what they ne'er might see again;
     Then foot and point and eye opposed,
     In dubious strife they darkly closed.


     XV.

     Ill fared it then with Roderick Dhu,
     That on the field his targe he threw,
     Whose brazen studs and tough bull-hide
     Had death so often dashed aside;
     For, trained abroad his arms to wield
     Fitz-James's blade was sword and shield.
     He practised every pass and ward,
     To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard;
     While less expert, though stronger far,
     The Gael maintained unequal war.
     Three times in closing strife they stood
     And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
     No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
     The gushing flood the tartars dyed.
     Fierce Roderick felt the fatal drain,
     And showered his blows like wintry rain;
     And, as firm rock or castle-roof
     Against the winter shower is proof,
     The foe, invulnerable still,
     Foiled his wild rage by steady skill;
     Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
     Forced Roderick's weapon from his hand,
     And backward borne upon the lea,
     Brought the proud Chieftain to his knee.


     XVI.

     Now yield thee, or by Him who made
     The world, thy heart's blood dyes my blade!;
     'Thy threats, thy mercy, I defy!
     Let recreant yield, who fears to die.'
     Like adder darting from his coil,
     Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
     Like mountain-cat who guards her young,
     Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprung;
     Received, but recked not of a wound,
     And locked his arms his foeman round.
     Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!
     No maiden's hand is round thee thrown!
     That desperate grasp thy frame might feel
     Through bars of brass and triple steel!
     They tug, they strain! down, down they go,
     The Gael above, Fitz-James below.
     The Chieftain's gripe his throat compressed,
     His knee was planted on his breast;
     His clotted locks he backward threw,
     Across his brow his hand he drew,
     From blood and mist to clear his sight,
     Then gleamed aloft his dagger bright!
     But hate and fury ill supplied
     The stream of life's exhausted tide,
     And all too late the advantage came,
     To turn the odds of deadly game;
     For, while the dagger gleamed on high,
     Reeled soul and sense, reeled brain and eye.
     Down came the blow! but in the heath
     The erring blade found bloodless sheath.
     The struggling foe may now unclasp
     The fainting Chief's relaxing grasp;
     Unwounded from the dreadful close,
     But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.


     XVII.

     He faltered thanks to Heaven for life,
     Redeemed, unhoped, from desperate strife;
     Next on his foe his look he cast,
     Whose every gasp appeared his last
     In Roderick's gore he dipped the braid,--
     'Poor Blanche! thy wrongs are dearly paid;
     Yet with thy foe must die, or live,
     The praise that faith and valor give.'
     With that he blew a bugle note,
     Undid the collar from his throat,
     Unbonneted, and by the wave
     Sat down his brow and hands to rave.
     Then faint afar are heard the feet
     Of rushing steeds in gallop fleet;
     The sounds increase, and now are seen
     Four mounted squires in Lincoln green;
     Two who bear lance, and two who lead
     By loosened rein a saddled steed;
     Each onward held his headlong course,
     And by Fitz-James reined up his horse,--
     With wonder viewed the bloody spot,--
     'Exclaim not, gallants' question not.--
     You, Herbert and Luffness, alight
     And bind the wounds of yonder knight;
     Let the gray palfrey bear his weight,
     We destined for a fairer freight,
     And bring him on to Stirling straight;
     I will before at better speed,
     To seek fresh horse and fitting weed.
     The sun rides high;--I must be boune
     To see the archer-game at noon;
     But lightly Bayard clears the lea.--
     De Vaux and Herries, follow me.


     XVIII.

     'Stand, Bayard, stand!'--the steed obeyed,
     With arching neck and bended head,
     And glancing eye and quivering ear,
     As if he loved his lord to hear.
     No foot Fitz-James in stirrup stayed,
     No grasp upon the saddle laid,
     But wreathed his left hand in the mane,
     And lightly bounded from the plain,
     Turned on the horse his armed heel,
     And stirred his courage with the steel.
     Bounded the fiery steed in air,
     The rider sat erect and fair,
     Then like a bolt from steel crossbow
     Forth launched, along the plain they go.
     They dashed that rapid torrent through,
     And up Carhonie's hill they flew;
     Still at the gallop pricked the Knight,
     His merrymen followed as they might.
     Along thy banks, swift Teith! they ride,
     And in the race they mock thy tide;
     Torry and Lendrick now are past,
     And Deanstown lies behind them cast;
     They rise, the bannered towers of Doune,
     They sink in distant woodland soon;
     Blair-Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire,
     They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre;
     They mark just glance and disappear
     The lofty brow of ancient Kier;
     They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides
     Dark Forth! amid thy sluggish tides,
     And on the opposing shore take ground
     With plash, with scramble, and with bound.
     Right-hand they leave thy cliffs, Craig-Forth!
     And soon the bulwark of the North,
     Gray Stirling, with her towers and town,
     Upon their fleet career looked clown.


     XIX.

     As up the flinty path they strained,
     Sudden his steed the leader reined;
     A signal to his squire he flung,
     Who instant to his stirrup sprung:--
     'Seest thou, De Vaux, yon woodsman gray,
     Who townward holds the rocky way,
     Of stature tall and poor array?
     Mark'st thou the firm, yet active stride,
     With which he scales the mountain-side?
     Know'st thou from whence he comes, or whom?'
     'No, by my word;--a burly groom
     He seems, who in the field or chase
     A baron's train would nobly grace--'
     'Out, out, De Vaux! can fear supply,
     And jealousy, no sharper eye?
     Afar, ere to the hill he drew,
     That stately form and step I knew;
     Like form in Scotland is not seen,
     Treads not such step on Scottish green.
     'Tis James of Douglas, by Saint Serle!
     The uncle of the banished Earl.
     Away, away, to court, to show
     The near approach of dreaded foe:
     The King must stand upon his guard;
     Douglas and he must meet prepared.'
     Then right-hand wheeled their steeds, and straight
     They won the Castle's postern gate.


     XX.

     The Douglas, who had bent his way
     From Cambus-kenneth's abbey gray,
     Now, as he climbed the rocky shelf,
     Held sad communion with himself:--
     'Yes! all is true my fears could frame;
     A prisoner lies the noble Graeme,
     And fiery Roderick soon will feel
     The vengeance of the royal steel.
     I, only I, can ward their fate,--
     God grant the ransom come not late!
     The Abbess hath her promise given,
     My child shall be the bride of Heaven;--
     Be pardoned one repining tear!
     For He who gave her knows how dear,
     How excellent!--but that is by,
     And now my business is--to die.--
     Ye towers! within whose circuit dread
     A Douglas by his sovereign bled;
     And thou, O sad and fatal mound!
     That oft hast heard the death-axe sound.
     As on the noblest of the land
     Fell the stern headsmen's bloody hand,--
     The dungeon, block, and nameless tomb
     Prepare--for Douglas seeks his doom!
     But hark! what blithe and jolly peal
     Makes the Franciscan steeple reel?
     And see! upon the crowded street,
     In motley groups what masquers meet!
     Banner and pageant, pipe and drum,
     And merry morrice-dancers come.
     I guess, by all this quaint array,
     The burghers hold their sports to-day.
     James will be there; he loves such show,
     Where the good yeoman bends his bow,
     And the tough wrestler foils his foe,
     As well as where, in proud career,
     The high-born filter shivers spear.
     I'll follow to the Castle-park,
     And play my prize;--King James shall mark
     If age has tamed these sinews stark,
     Whose force so oft in happier days
     His boyish wonder loved to praise.'


     XXI.

     The Castle gates were open flung,
     The quivering drawbridge rocked and rung,
     And echoed loud the flinty street
     Beneath the coursers' clattering feet,
     As slowly down the steep descent
     Fair Scotland's King and nobles went,
     While all along the crowded way
     Was jubilee and loud huzza.
     And ever James was bending low
     To his white jennet's saddle-bow,
     Doffing his cap to city dame,
     Who smiled and blushed for pride and shame.
     And well the simperer might be vain,--
     He chose the fairest of the train.
     Gravely he greets each city sire,
     Commends each pageant's quaint attire,
     Gives to the dancers thanks aloud,
     And smiles and nods upon the crowd,
     Who rend the heavens with their acclaims,--
     'Long live the Commons' King, King James!'
     Behind the King thronged peer and knight,
     And noble dame and damsel bright,
     Whose fiery steeds ill brooked the stay
     Of the steep street and crowded way.
     But in the train you might discern
     Dark lowering brow and visage stern;
     There nobles mourned their pride restrained,
     And the mean burgher's joys disdained;
     And chiefs, who, hostage for their clan,
     Were each from home a banished man,
     There thought upon their own gray tower,
     Their waving woods, their feudal power,
     And deemed themselves a shameful part
     Of pageant which they cursed in heart.


     XXII.

     Now, in the Castle-park, drew out
     Their checkered bands the joyous rout.
     There morricers, with bell at heel
     And blade in hand, their mazes wheel;
     But chief, beside the butts, there stand
     Bold Robin Hood and all his band,--
     Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl,
     Old Scathelocke with his surly scowl,
     Maid Marian, fair as ivory bone,
     Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John;
     Their bugles challenge all that will,
     In archery to prove their skill.
     The Douglas bent a bow of might,--
     His first shaft centred in the white,
     And when in turn he shot again,
     His second split the first in twain.
     From the King's hand must Douglas take
     A silver dart, the archers' stake;
     Fondly he watched, with watery eye,
     Some answering glance of sympathy,--
     No kind emotion made reply!
     Indifferent as to archer wight,
     The monarch gave the arrow bright.


     XXIII.

     Now, clear the ring! for, hand to hand,
     The manly wrestlers take their stand.
     Two o'er the rest superior rose,
     And proud demanded mightier foes,--
     Nor called in vain, for Douglas came.--
     For life is Hugh of Larbert lame;
     Scarce better John of Alloa's fare,
     Whom senseless home his comrades bare.
     Prize of the wrestling match, the King
     To Douglas gave a golden ring,
     While coldly glanced his eye of blue,
     As frozen drop of wintry dew.
     Douglas would speak, but in his breast
     His struggling soul his words suppressed;
     Indignant then he turned him where
     Their arms the brawny yeomen bare,
     To hurl the massive bar in air.
     When each his utmost strength had shown,
     The Douglas rent an earth-fast stone
     From its deep bed, then heaved it high,
     And sent the fragment through the sky
     A rood beyond the farthest mark;
     And still in Stirling's royal park,
     The gray-haired sires, who know the past,
     To strangers point the Douglas cast,
     And moralize on the decay
     Of Scottish strength in modern day.


     XXIV.

     The vale with loud applauses rang,
     The Ladies' Rock sent back the clang.
     The King, with look unmoved, bestowed
     A purse well filled with pieces broad.
     Indignant smiled the Douglas proud,
     And threw the gold among the crowd,
     Who now with anxious wonder scan,
     And sharper glance, the dark gray man;
     Till whispers rose among the throng,
     That heart so free, and hand so strong,
     Must to the Douglas blood belong.
     The old men marked and shook the head,
     To see his hair with silver spread,
     And winked aside, and told each son
     Of feats upon the English done,
     Ere Douglas of the stalwart hand
     Was exiled from his native land.
     The women praised his stately form,
     Though wrecked by many a winter's storm;
     The youth with awe and wonder saw
     His strength surpassing Nature's law.
     Thus judged, as is their wont, the crowd
     Till murmurs rose to clamours loud.
     But not a glance from that proud ring
     Of peers who circled round the King
     With Douglas held communion kind,
     Or called the banished man to mind;
     No, not from those who at the chase
     Once held his side the honoured place,
     Begirt his board, and in the field
     Found safety underneath his shield;
     For he whom royal eyes disown,
     When was his form to courtiers known!


     XXV.

     The Monarch saw the gambols flag
     And bade let loose a gallant stag,
     Whose pride, the holiday to crown,
     Two favorite greyhounds should pull down,
     That venison free and Bourdeaux wine
     Might serve the archery to dine.
     But Lufra,--whom from Douglas' side
     Nor bribe nor threat could e'er divide,
     The fleetest hound in all the North,--
     Brave Lufra saw, and darted forth.
     She left the royal hounds midway,
     And dashing on the antlered prey,
     Sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank,
     And deep the flowing life-blood drank.
     The King's stout huntsman saw the sport
     By strange intruder broken short,
     Came up, and with his leash unbound
     In anger struck the noble hound.
     The Douglas had endured, that morn,
     The King's cold look, the nobles' scorn,
     And last, and worst to spirit proud,
     Had borne the pity of the crowd;
     But Lufra had been fondly bred,
     To share his board, to watch his bed,
     And oft would Ellen Lufra's neck
     In maiden glee with garlands deck;
     They were such playmates that with name
     Of Lufra Ellen's image came.
     His stifled wrath is brimming high,
     In darkened brow and flashing eye;
     As waves before the bark divide,
     The crowd gave way before his stride;
     Needs but a buffet and no more,
     The groom lies senseless in his gore.
     Such blow no other hand could deal,
     Though gauntleted in glove of steel.


     XXVI.

     Then clamored loud the royal train,
     And brandished swords and staves amain,
     But stern the Baron's warning:
     'Back! Back, on your lives, ye menial pack!
     Beware the Douglas.--Yes! behold,
     King James! The Douglas, doomed of old,
     And vainly sought for near and far,
     A victim to atone the war,
     A willing victim, now attends,
     Nor craves thy grace but for his friends.--'
     'Thus is my clemency repaid?
     Presumptuous Lord!' the Monarch said:
     'Of thy misproud ambitious clan,
     Thou, James of Bothwell, wert the man,
     The only man, in whom a foe
     My woman-mercy would not know;
     But shall a Monarch's presence brook
     Injurious blow and haughty look?--
     What ho! the Captain of our Guard!
     Give the offender fitting ward.--
     Break off the sports!'--for tumult rose,
     And yeomen 'gan to bend their bows,
     'Break off the sports!' he said and frowned,
     'And bid our horsemen clear the ground.'


     XXVII.

     Then uproar wild and misarray
     Marred the fair form of festal day.
     The horsemen pricked among the crowd,
     Repelled by threats and insult loud;
     To earth are borne the old and weak,
     The timorous fly, the women shriek;
     With flint, with shaft, with staff, with bar,
     The hardier urge tumultuous war.
     At once round Douglas darkly sweep
     The royal spears in circle deep,
     And slowly scale the pathway steep,
     While on the rear in thunder pour
     The rabble with disordered roar
     With grief the noble Douglas saw
     The Commons rise against the law,
     And to the leading soldier said:
     'Sir John of Hyndford, 'twas my blade
     That knighthood on thy shoulder laid;
     For that good deed permit me then
     A word with these misguided men.--


     XXVIII,

     'Hear, gentle friends, ere yet for me
     Ye break the bands of fealty.
     My life, my honour, and my cause,
     I tender free to Scotland's laws.
     Are these so weak as must require
     'Fine aid of your misguided ire?
     Or if I suffer causeless wrong,
     Is then my selfish rage so strong,
     My sense of public weal so low,
     That, for mean vengeance on a foe,
     Those cords of love I should unbind
     Which knit my country and my kind?
     O no! Believe, in yonder tower
     It will not soothe my captive hour,
     To know those spears our foes should dread
     For me in kindred gore are red:
     'To know, in fruitless brawl begun,
     For me that mother wails her son,
     For me that widow's mate expires,
     For me that orphans weep their sires,
     That patriots mourn insulted laws,
     And curse the Douglas for the cause.
     O let your patience ward such ill,
     And keep your right to love me still!'


     XXIX.

     The crowd's wild fury sunk again
     In tears, as tempests melt in rain.
     With lifted hands and eyes, they prayed
     For blessings on his generous head
     Who for his country felt alone,
     And prized her blood beyond his own.
     Old men upon the verge of life
     Blessed him who stayed the civil strife;
     And mothers held their babes on high,
     The self-devoted Chief to spy,
     Triumphant over wrongs and ire,
     To whom the prattlers owed a sire.
     Even the rough soldier's heart was moved;
     As if behind some bier beloved,
     With trailing arms and drooping head,
     The Douglas up the hill he led,
     And at the Castle's battled verge,
     With sighs resigned his honoured charge.


     XXX.

     The offended Monarch rode apart,
     With bitter thought and swelling heart,
     And would not now vouchsafe again
     Through Stirling streets to lead his train.
     'O Lennox, who would wish to rule
     This changeling crowd, this common fool?
     Hear'st thou,' he said, 'the loud acclaim
     With which they shout the Douglas name?
     With like acclaim the vulgar throat
     Strained for King James their morning note;
     With like acclaim they hailed the day
     When first I broke the Douglas sway;
     And like acclaim would Douglas greet
     If he could hurl me from my seat.
     Who o'er the herd would wish to reign,
     Fantastic, fickle, fierce, and vain?
     Vain as the leaf upon the stream,
     And fickle as a changeful dream;
     Fantastic as a woman's mood,
     And fierce as Frenzy's fevered blood.
     Thou many-headed monster-thing,
     O who would wish to be thy king?--


     XXXI..

     'But soft! what messenger of speed
     Spurs hitherward his panting steed?
     I guess his cognizance afar--
     What from our cousin, John of Mar?'
     'He prays, my liege, your sports keep bound
     Within the safe and guarded ground;
     For some foul purpose yet unknown,--
     Most sure for evil to the throne,--
     The outlawed Chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
     Has summoned his rebellious crew;
     'Tis said, in James of Bothwell's aid
     These loose banditti stand arrayed.
     The Earl of Mar this morn from Doune
     To break their muster marched, and soon
     Your Grace will hear of battle fought;
     But earnestly the Earl besought,
     Till for such danger he provide,
     With scanty train you will not ride.'


     XXXII.

     'Thou warn'st me I have done amiss,--
     I should have earlier looked to this;
     I lost it in this bustling day.--
     Retrace with speed thy former way;
     Spare not for spoiling of thy steed,
     The best of mine shall be thy meed.
     Say to our faithful Lord of Mar,
     We do forbid the intended war;
     Roderick this morn in single fight
     Was made our prisoner by a knight,
     And Douglas hath himself and cause
     Submitted to our kingdom's laws.
     The tidings of their leaders lost
     Will soon dissolve the mountain host,
     Nor would we that the vulgar feel,
     For their Chief's crimes, avenging steel.
     Bear Mar our message, Braco, fly!'
     He turned his steed,--'My liege, I hie,
     Yet ere I cross this lily lawn
     I fear the broadswords will be drawn.'
     The turf the flying courser spurned,
     And to his towers the King returned.


     XXXIII.

     Ill with King James's mood that day
     Suited gay feast and minstrel lay;
     Soon were dismissed the courtly throng,
     And soon cut short the festal song.
     Nor less upon the saddened town
     The evening sunk in sorrow down.
     The burghers spoke of civil jar,
     Of rumoured feuds and mountain war,
     Of Moray, Mar, and Roderick Dhu,
     All up in arms;--the Douglas too,
     They mourned him pent within the hold,
     'Where stout Earl William was of old.'--
     And there his word the speaker stayed,
     And finger on his lip he laid,
     Or pointed to his dagger blade.
     But jaded horsemen from the west
     At evening to the Castle pressed,
     And busy talkers said they bore
     Tidings of fight on Katrine's shore;
     At noon the deadly fray begun,
     And lasted till the set of sun.
     Thus giddy rumor shook the town,
     Till closed the Night her pennons brown.




CANTO SIXTH.

The Guard-room.



     I.

     The sun, awakening, through the smoky air
         Of the dark city casts a sullen glance,
     Rousing each caitiff to his task of care,
         Of sinful man the sad inheritance;
     Summoning revellers from the lagging dance,
         Scaring the prowling robber to his den;
     Gilding on battled tower the warder's lance,
         And warning student pale to leave his pen,
     And yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men.

     What various scenes, and O, what scenes of woe,
         Are witnessed by that red and struggling beam!
     The fevered patient, from his pallet low,
         Through crowded hospital beholds it stream;
     The ruined maiden trembles at its gleam,
         The debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail,
     'The love-lore wretch starts from tormenting dream:
         The wakeful mother, by the glimmering pale,
     Trims her sick infant's couch, and soothes his feeble wail.


     II.

     At dawn the towers of Stirling rang
     With soldier-step and weapon-clang,
     While drums with rolling note foretell
     Relief to weary sentinel.
     Through narrow loop and casement barred,
     The sunbeams sought the Court of Guard,
     And, struggling with the smoky air,
     Deadened the torches' yellow glare.
     In comfortless alliance shone
     The lights through arch of blackened stone,
     And showed wild shapes in garb of war,
     Faces deformed with beard and scar,
     All haggard from the midnight watch,
     And fevered with the stern debauch;
     For the oak table's massive board,
     Flooded with wine, with fragments stored,
     And beakers drained, and cups o'erthrown,
     Showed in what sport the night had flown.
     Some, weary, snored on floor and bench;
     Some labored still their thirst to quench;
     Some, chilled with watching, spread their hands
     O'er the huge chimney's dying brands,
     While round them, or beside them flung,
     At every step their harness rung.


     III.

     These drew not for their fields the sword,
     Like tenants of a feudal lord,
     Nor owned the patriarchal claim
     Of Chieftain in their leader's name;
     Adventurers they, from far who roved,
     To live by battle which they loved.
     There the Italian's clouded face,
     The swarthy Spaniard's there you trace;
     The mountain-loving Switzer there
     More freely breathed in mountain-air;
     The Fleming there despised the soil
     That paid so ill the labourer's toil;
     Their rolls showed French and German name;
     And merry England's exiles came,
     To share, with ill-concealed disdain,
     Of Scotland's pay the scanty gain.
     All brave in arms, well trained to wield
     The heavy halberd, brand, and shield;
     In camps licentious, wild, and bold;
     In pillage fierce and uncontrolled;
     And now, by holytide and feast,
     From rules of discipline released.


     IV.

     'They held debate of bloody fray,
     Fought 'twixt Loch Katrine and Achray.
     Fierce was their speech, and mid their words
     'Their hands oft grappled to their swords;
     Nor sunk their tone to spare the ear
     Of wounded comrades groaning near,
     Whose mangled limbs and bodies gored
     Bore token of the mountain sword,
     Though, neighbouring to the Court of Guard,
     Their prayers and feverish wails were heard,--
     Sad burden to the ruffian joke,
     And savage oath by fury spoke!--
     At length up started John of Brent,
     A yeoman from the banks of Trent;
     A stranger to respect or fear,
     In peace a chaser of the deer,
     In host a hardy mutineer,
     But still the boldest of the crew
     When deed of danger was to do.
     He grieved that day their games cut short,
     And marred the dicer's brawling sport,
     And shouted loud, 'Renew the bowl!
     And, while a merry catch I troll,
     Let each the buxom chorus bear,
     Like brethren of the brand and spear.'


     V.

     Soldier's Song.

     Our vicar still preaches that Peter and Poule
     Laid a swinging long curse on the bonny brown bowl,
     That there 's wrath and despair in the jolly black-jack,
     And the seven deadly sins in a flagon of sack;
     Yet whoop, Barnaby! off with thy liquor,
     Drink upsees out, and a fig for the vicar!

     Our vicar he calls it damnation to sip
     The ripe ruddy dew of a woman's dear lip,
     Says that Beelzebub lurks in her kerchief so sly,
     And Apollyon shoots darts from her merry black eye;
     Yet whoop, Jack! kiss Gillian the quicker,
     Till she bloom like a rose, and a fig for the vicar!

     Our vicar thus preaches,--and why should he not?
     For the dues of his cure are the placket and pot;
     And 'tis right of his office poor laymen to lurch
     Who infringe the domains of our good Mother Church.
     Yet whoop, bully-boys! off with your liquor,
     Sweet Marjorie 's the word and a fig for the vicar!


     VI.

     The warder's challenge, heard without,
     Stayed in mid-roar the merry shout.
     A soldier to the portal went,--
     'Here is old Bertram, sirs, of Ghent;
     And--beat for jubilee the drum!--
     A maid and minstrel with him come.'
     Bertram, a Fleming, gray and scarred,
     Was entering now the Court of Guard,
     A harper with him, and, in plaid
     All muffled close, a mountain maid,
     Who backward shrunk to 'scape the view
     Of the loose scene and boisterous crew.
     'What news?' they roared:--' I only know,
     From noon till eve we fought with foe,
     As wild and as untamable
     As the rude mountains where they dwell;
     On both sides store of blood is lost,
     Nor much success can either boast.'--
     'But whence thy captives, friend? such spoil
     As theirs must needs reward thy toil.
     Old dost thou wax, and wars grow sharp;
     Thou now hast glee-maiden and harp!
     Get thee an ape, and trudge the land,
     The leader of a juggler band.'


     VII.

     'No, comrade;--no such fortune mine.
     After the fight these sought our line,
     That aged harper and the girl,
     And, having audience of the Earl,
     Mar bade I should purvey them steed,
     And bring them hitherward with speed.
     Forbear your mirth and rude alarm,
     For none shall do them shame or harm.--
     'Hear ye his boast?' cried John of Brent,
     Ever to strife and jangling bent;
     'Shall he strike doe beside our lodge,
     And yet the jealous niggard grudge
     To pay the forester his fee?
     I'll have my share howe'er it be,
     Despite of Moray, Mar, or thee.'
     Bertram his forward step withstood;
     And, burning in his vengeful mood,
     Old Allan, though unfit for strife,
     Laid hand upon his dagger-knife;
     But Ellen boldly stepped between,
     And dropped at once the tartan screen:--
     So, from his morning cloud, appears
     The sun of May through summer tears.
     The savage soldiery, amazed,
     As on descended angel gazed;
     Even hardy Brent, abashed and tamed,
     Stood half admiring, half ashamed.


     VIII.

     Boldly she spoke: 'Soldiers, attend!
     My father was the soldier's friend,
     Cheered him in camps, in marches led,
     And with him in the battle bled.
     Not from the valiant or the strong
     Should exile's daughter suffer wrong.'
     Answered De Brent, most forward still
     In every feat or good or ill:
     'I shame me of the part I played;
     And thou an outlaw's child, poor maid!
     An outlaw I by forest laws,
     And merry Needwood knows the cause.
     Poor Rose,--if Rose be living now,'--
     He wiped his iron eye and brow,--
     'Must bear such age, I think, as thou.--
     Hear ye, my mates! I go to call
     The Captain of our watch to hall:
     There lies my halberd on the floor;
     And he that steps my halberd o'er,
     To do the maid injurious part,
     My shaft shall quiver in his heart!
     Beware loose speech, or jesting rough;
     Ye all know John de Brent. Enough.'


     IX.

     Their Captain came, a gallant young,--
     Of Tullibardine's house he sprung,--
     Nor wore he yet the spurs of knight;
     Gay was his mien, his humor light
     And, though by courtesy controlled,
     Forward his speech, his bearing bold.
     The high-born maiden ill could brook
     The scanning of his curious look
     And dauntless eye:--and yet, in sooth
     Young Lewis was a generous youth;
     But Ellen's lovely face and mien
     Ill suited to the garb and scene,
     Might lightly bear construction strange,
     And give loose fancy scope to range.
     'Welcome to Stirling towers, fair maid!
     Come ye to seek a champion's aid,
     On palfrey white, with harper hoar,
     Like errant damosel of yore?
     Does thy high quest a knight require,
     Or may the venture suit a squire?'
     Her dark eye flashed;--she paused and sighed:--
     'O what have I to do with pride!--
     Through scenes of sorrow, shame, and strife,
     A suppliant for a father's life,
     I crave an audience of the King.
     Behold, to back my suit, a ring,
     The royal pledge of grateful claims,
     Given by the Monarch to Fitz-James.'


     X.

     The signet-ring young Lewis took
     With deep respect and altered look,
     And said: 'This ring our duties own;
     And pardon, if to worth unknown,
     In semblance mean obscurely veiled,
     Lady, in aught my folly failed.
     Soon as the day flings wide his gates,
     The King shall know what suitor waits.
     Please you meanwhile in fitting bower
     Repose you till his waking hour.
     Female attendance shall obey
     Your hest, for service or array.
     Permit I marshal you the way.'
     But, ere she followed, with the grace
     And open bounty of her race,
     She bade her slender purse be shared
     Among the soldiers of the guard.
     The rest with thanks their guerdon took,
     But Brent, with shy and awkward look,
     On the reluctant maiden's hold
     Forced bluntly back the proffered gold:--
     'Forgive a haughty English heart,
     And O, forget its ruder part!

     The vacant purse shall be my share,
     Which in my barrel-cap I'll bear,
     Perchance, in jeopardy of war,
     Where gayer crests may keep afar.'
     With thanks--'twas all she could--the maid
     His rugged courtesy repaid.


     XI.

     When Ellen forth with Lewis went,
     Allan made suit to John of Brent:--
     'My lady safe, O let your grace
     Give me to see my master's face!
     His minstrel I,--to share his doom
     Bound from the cradle to the tomb.
     Tenth in descent, since first my sires
     Waked for his noble house their Iyres,
     Nor one of all the race was known
     But prized its weal above their own.
     With the Chief's birth begins our care;
     Our harp must soothe the infant heir,
     Teach the youth tales of fight, and grace
     His earliest feat of field or chase;
     In peace, in war, our rank we keep,
     We cheer his board, we soothe his sleep,
     Nor leave him till we pour our verse--
     A doleful tribute!--o'er his hearse.
     Then let me share his captive lot;
     It is my right,--deny it not!'
     'Little we reck,' said John of Brent,
     'We Southern men, of long descent;
     Nor wot we how a name--a word--
     Makes clansmen vassals to a lord:
     Yet kind my noble landlord's part,--
     God bless the house of Beaudesert!
     And, but I loved to drive the deer
     More than to guide the labouring steer,
     I had not dwelt an outcast here.
     Come, good old Minstrel, follow me;
     Thy Lord and Chieftain shalt thou see.'


     XII.

     Then, from a rusted iron hook,
     A bunch of ponderous keys he took,
     Lighted a torch, and Allan led
     Through grated arch and passage dread.
     Portals they passed, where, deep within,
     Spoke prisoner's moan and fetters' din;
     Through rugged vaults, where, loosely stored,
     Lay wheel, and axe, and headsmen's sword,
     And many a hideous engine grim,
     For wrenching joint and crushing limb,
     By artists formed who deemed it shame
     And sin to give their work a name.
     They halted at a Iow-browed porch,
     And Brent to Allan gave the torch,
     While bolt and chain he backward rolled,
     And made the bar unhasp its hold.
     They entered:--'twas a prison-room
     Of stern security and gloom,
     Yet not a dungeon; for the day
     Through lofty gratings found its way,
     And rude and antique garniture
     Decked the sad walls and oaken floor,
     Such as the rugged days of old
     Deemed fit for captive noble's hold.
     'Here,' said De Brent, 'thou mayst remain
     Till the Leech visit him again.
     Strict is his charge, the warders tell,
     To tend the noble prisoner well.'
     Retiring then the bolt he drew,
     And the lock's murmurs growled anew.
     Roused at the sound, from lowly bed
     A captive feebly raised his head.
     The wondering Minstrel looked, and knew--
     Not his dear lord, but Roderick Dhu!
     For, come from where Clan-Alpine fought,
     They, erring, deemed the Chief he sought.


     XIII.

     As the tall ship, whose lofty prore
     Shall never stem the billows more,
     Deserted by her gallant band,
     Amid the breakers lies astrand,--
     So on his couch lay Roderick Dhu!
     And oft his fevered limbs he threw
     In toss abrupt, as when her sides
     Lie rocking in the advancing tides,
     That shake her frame with ceaseless beat,
     Yet cannot heave her from her seat;--
     O, how unlike her course at sea!
     Or his free step on hill and lea!--
     Soon as the Minstrel he could scan,--
     'What of thy lady?--of my clan?--
     My mother?--Douglas?--tell me all!
     Have they been ruined in my fall?
     Ah, yes! or wherefore art thou here?
     Yet speak,--speak boldly,--do not fear.'--
     For Allan, who his mood well knew,
     Was choked with grief and terror too.--
     'Who fought?--who fled?--Old man, be brief;--
     Some might,--for they had lost their Chief.
     Who basely live?--who bravely died?'
     'O, calm thee, Chief!' the Minstrel cried,
     'Ellen is safe!' 'For that thank Heaven!'
     'And hopes are for the Douglas given;--
     The Lady Margaret, too, is well;
     And, for thy clan,--on field or fell,
     Has never harp of minstrel told
     Of combat fought so true and bold.
     Thy stately Pine is yet unbent,
     Though many a goodly bough is rent.'


     XIV.

     The Chieftain reared his form on high,
     And fever's fire was in his eye;
     But ghastly, pale, and livid streaks
     Checkered his swarthy brow and cheeks.
     'Hark, Minstrel! I have heard thee play,
     With measure bold on festal day,
     In yon lone isle,--again where ne'er
     Shall harper play or warrior hear!--
     That stirring air that peals on high,
     O'er Dermid's race our victory.--
     Strike it!--and then,--for well thou canst,--
     Free from thy minstrel-spirit glanced,
     Fling me the picture of the fight,
     When met my clan the Saxon might.
     I'll listen, till my fancy hears
     The clang of swords' the crash of spears!
     These grates, these walls, shall vanish then
     For the fair field of fighting men,
     And my free spirit burst away,
     As if it soared from battle fray.'
     The trembling Bard with awe obeyed,--
     Slow on the harp his hand he laid;
     But soon remembrance of the sight
     He witnessed from the mountain's height,
     With what old Bertram told at night,
     Awakened the full power of song,
     And bore him in career along;--
     As shallop launched on river's tide,
     'That slow and fearful leaves the side,
     But, when it feels the middle stream,
     Drives downward swift as lightning's beam.


     XV.

     Battle of Beal' An Duine.

     'The Minstrel came once more to view
     The eastern ridge of Benvenue,
     For ere he parted he would say
     Farewell to lovely loch Achray
     Where shall he find, in foreign land,
     So lone a lake, so sweet a strand!--
     There is no breeze upon the fern,
          No ripple on the lake,
     Upon her eyry nods the erne,
          The deer has sought the brake;
     The small birds will not sing aloud,
          The springing trout lies still,
     So darkly glooms yon thunder-cloud,
     That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
          Benledi's distant hill.
     Is it the thunder's solemn sound
          That mutters deep and dread,
     Or echoes from the groaning ground
          The warrior's measured tread?
     Is it the lightning's quivering glance
          That on the thicket streams,
     Or do they flash on spear and lance
          The sun's retiring beams?--
     I see the dagger-crest of Mar,
     I see the Moray's silver star,
     Wave o'er the cloud of Saxon war,
     That up the lake comes winding far!

          To hero boune for battle-strife,
               Or bard of martial lay,
          'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,
               One glance at their array!


     XVI.

     'Their light-armed archers far and near
          Surveyed the tangled ground,
     Their centre ranks, with pike and spear,
          A twilight forest frowned,
     Their barded horsemen in the rear
          The stern battalia crowned.
     No cymbal clashed, no clarion rang,
          Still were the pipe and drum;
     Save heavy tread, and armor's clang,
          The sullen march was dumb.
     There breathed no wind their crests to shake,
          Or wave their flags abroad;
     Scarce the frail aspen seemed to quake
          That shadowed o'er their road.
     Their vaward scouts no tidings bring,
          Can rouse no lurking foe,
     Nor spy a trace of living thing,
          Save when they stirred the roe;
     The host moves like a deep-sea wave,
     Where rise no rocks its pride to brave
          High-swelling, dark, and slow.
     The lake is passed, and now they gain
     A narrow and a broken plain,
     Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
     And here the horse and spearmen pause
     While, to explore the dangerous glen
     Dive through the pass the archer-men.


     XVII.

     'At once there rose so wild a yell
     Within that dark and narrow dell,
     As all the fiends from heaven that fell
     Had pealed the banner-cry of hell!
          Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
          Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
               The archery appear:
          For life! for life! their flight they ply--
          And shriek, and shout, and battle-cry,
          And plaids and bonnets waving high,
          And broadswords flashing to the sky,
               Are maddening in the rear.
          Onward they drive in dreadful race,
               Pursuers and pursued;
          Before that tide of flight and chase,
          How shall it keep its rooted place,
               The spearmen's twilight wood?--"
          "Down, down," cried Mar, "your lances down'
               Bear back both friend and foe! "--
          Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
          That serried grove of lances brown
               At once lay levelled low;
          And closely shouldering side to side,
          The bristling ranks the onset bide.--"
          "We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
               As their Tinchel cows the game!
          They come as fleet as forest deer,
               We'll drive them back as tame."


     XVIII.

     'Bearing before them in their course
     The relics of the archer force,
     Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
     Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.
          Above the tide, each broadsword bright
          Was brandishing like beam of light,
               Each targe was dark below;
          And with the ocean's mighty swing,
          When heaving to the tempest's wing,
               They hurled them on the foe.
     I heard the lance's shivering crash,
     As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
     I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
     As if a hundred anvils rang!
     But Moray wheeled his rearward rank
     Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,--
               "My banner-man, advance!
          I see," he cried, "their column shake.
          Now, gallants! for your ladies' sake,
               Upon them with the lance!"--
     The horsemen dashed among the rout,
          As deer break through the broom;

     Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
          They soon make lightsome room.
     Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
          Where, where was Roderick then!
     One blast upon his bugle-horn
          Were worth a thousand men.
     And refluent through the pass of fear
          The battle's tide was poured;
     Vanished the Saxon's struggling spear,
          Vanished the mountain-sword.
     As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
          Receives her roaring linn
     As the dark caverns of the deep
          Suck the wild whirlpool in,
     So did the deep and darksome pass
     Devour the battle's mingled mass;
     None linger now upon the plain
     Save those who ne'er shall fight again.


     XIX.

     'Now westward rolls the battle's din,
     That deep and doubling pass within.--
     Minstrel, away! the work of fate
     Is bearing on; its issue wait,
     Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
     Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.
     Gray Benvenue I soon repassed,
     Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.
          The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
               The lowering scowl of heaven
          An inky hue of livid blue
               To the deep lake has given;
     Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
     Swept o'er the lake, then sunk again.
     I heeded not the eddying surge,
     Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
     Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
     Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
     And spoke the stern and desperate strife
     That parts not but with parting life,
     Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
     The dirge of many a passing soul.
          Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
          The martial flood disgorged again,
               But not in mingled tide;
          The plaided warriors of the North
          High on the mountain thunder forth
               And overhang its side,
          While by the lake below appears
          The darkening cloud of Saxon spears.
          At weary bay each shattered band,
          Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
          Their banners stream like tattered sail,
          That flings its fragments to the gale,
          And broken arms and disarray
          Marked the fell havoc of the day.


     XX.

     'Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
     The Saxons stood in sullen trance,
     Till Moray pointed with his lance,
          And cried: "Behold yon isle!--
     See! none are left to guard its strand
     But women weak, that wring the hand:
     'Tis there of yore the robber band
          Their booty wont to pile;--
     My purse, with bonnet-pieces store,
     To him will swim a bow-shot o'er,
     And loose a shallop from the shore.
     Lightly we'll tame the war-wolf then,
     Lords of his mate, and brood, and den."
     Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
     On earth his casque and corselet rung,
          He plunged him in the wave:--
     All saw the deed,--the purpose knew,
     And to their clamors Benvenue
          A mingled echo gave;
     The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
     The helpless females scream for fear
     And yells for rage the mountaineer.
     'T was then, as by the outcry riven,
     Poured down at once the lowering heaven:
     A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
     Her billows reared their snowy crest.
     Well for the swimmer swelled they high,
     To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
     For round him showered, mid rain and hail,
     The vengeful arrows of the Gael.
     In vain.--He nears the isle--and lo!
     His hand is on a shallop's bow.
     Just then a flash of lightning came,
     It tinged the waves and strand with flame;
     I marked Duncraggan's widowed dame,
     Behind an oak I saw her stand,
     A naked dirk gleamed in her hand:--
     It darkened,--but amid the moan
     Of waves I heard a dying groan;--
     Another flash!--the spearman floats
     A weltering corse beside the boats,
     And the stern matron o'er him stood,
     Her hand and dagger streaming blood.


     XXI.

     "'Revenge! revenge!" the Saxons cried,
     The Gaels' exulting shout replied.
     Despite the elemental rage,
     Again they hurried to engage;
     But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
     Bloody with spurring came a knight,
     Sprung from his horse, and from a crag
     Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.
     Clarion and trumpet by his side
     Rung forth a truce-note high and wide,
     While, in the Monarch's name, afar
     A herald's voice forbade the war,
     For Bothwell's lord and Roderick bold
     Were both, he said, in captive hold.'--
     But here the lay made sudden stand,
     The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!
     Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
     How Roderick brooked his minstrelsy:
     At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
     With lifted hand kept feeble time;
     That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
     Varied his look as changed the song;
     At length, no more his deafened ear
     The minstrel melody can hear;
     His face grows sharp,--his hands are clenched'
     As if some pang his heart-strings wrenched;
     Set are his teeth, his fading eye
     Is sternly fixed on vacancy;
     Thus, motionless and moanless, drew
     His parting breath stout Roderick Dhu!--
     Old Allan-bane looked on aghast,
     While grim and still his spirit passed;
     But when he saw that life was fled,
     He poured his wailing o'er the dead.


     XXII.

     Lament.

     'And art thou cold and lowly laid,
     Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
     Breadalbane's boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!
     For thee shall none a requiem say?--
     For thee, who loved the minstrel's lay,
     For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
     The shelter of her exiled line,
     E'en in this prison-house of thine,
     I'll wail for Alpine's honored Pine!

     'What groans shall yonder valleys fill!
     What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!
     What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
     When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
     Thy fall before the race was won,
     Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!
     There breathes not clansman of thy line,
     But would have given his life for thine.
     O, woe for Alpine's honoured Pine!

     'Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
     The captive thrush may brook the cage,
     The prisoned eagle dies for rage.
     Brave spirit, do Dot scorn my strain!
     And, when its notes awake again,
     Even she, so long beloved in vain,
     Shall with my harp her voice combine,
     And mix her woe and tears with mine,
     To wail Clan-Alpine's honoured Pine.'


     XXIII.

     Ellen the while, with bursting heart,
     Remained in lordly bower apart,
     Where played, with many-coloured gleams,
     Through storied pane the rising beams.
     In vain on gilded roof they fall,
     And lightened up a tapestried wall,
     And for her use a menial train
     A rich collation spread in vain.
     The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
     Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
     Or if she looked, 't was but to say,
     With better omen dawned the day
     In that lone isle, where waved on high
     The dun-deer's hide for canopy;
     Where oft her noble father shared
     The simple meal her care prepared,
     While Lufra, crouching by her side,
     Her station claimed with jealous pride,
     And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
     Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
     Whose answer, oft at random made,
     The wandering of his thoughts betrayed.
     Those who such simple joys have known
     Are taught to prize them when they 're gone.
     But sudden, see, she lifts her head;
     The window seeks with cautious tread.
     What distant music has the power
     To win her in this woful hour?
     'T was from a turret that o'erhung
     Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.


     XXIV.

     Lay of the Imprisoned Huntsman.

     'My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
     My idle greyhound loathes his food,
     My horse is weary of his stall,
     And I am sick of captive thrall.
     I wish I were as I have been,
     Hunting the hart in forest green,
     With bended bow and bloodhound free,
     For that's the life is meet for me.

     I hate to learn the ebb of time
     From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
     Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
     Inch after inch, along the wall.
     The lark was wont my matins ring,
     The sable rook my vespers sing;
     These towers, although a king's they be,
     Have not a hall of joy for me.

     No more at dawning morn I rise,
     And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
     Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
     And homeward wend with evening dew;
     A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
     And lay my trophies at her feet,
     While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
     That life is lost to love and me!'


     XXV.

     The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
     The listener had not turned her head,
     It trickled still, the starting tear,
     When light a footstep struck her ear,
     And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.
     She turned the hastier, lest again
     The prisoner should renew his strain.
     'O welcome, brave Fitz-James!' she said;
     'How may an almost orphan maid
     Pay the deep debt--' 'O say not so!
     To me no gratitude you owe.
     Not mine, alas! the boon to give,
     And bid thy noble father live;
     I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
     With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.
     No tyrant he, though ire and pride
     May lay his better mood aside.
     Come, Ellen, come! 'tis more than time,
     He holds his court at morning prime.'
     With heating heart, and bosom wrung,
     As to a brother's arm she clung.
     Gently he dried the falling tear,
     And gently whispered hope and cheer;
     Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,
     Through gallery fair and high arcade,
     Till at his touch its wings of pride
     A portal arch unfolded wide.


     XXVI.

     Within 't was brilliant all and light,
     A thronging scene of figures bright;
     It glowed on Ellen's dazzled sight,
     As when the setting sun has given
     Ten thousand hues to summer even,
     And from their tissue fancy frames
     Aerial knights and fairy dames.
     Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
     A few faint steps she forward made,
     Then slow her drooping head she raised,
     And fearful round the presence gazed;
     For him she sought who owned this state,
     The dreaded Prince whose will was fate!--
     She gazed on many a princely port
     Might well have ruled a royal court;
     On many a splendid garb she gazed,--
     Then turned bewildered and amazed,
     For all stood bare; and in the room
     Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.
     To him each lady's look was lent,
     On him each courtier's eye was bent;
     Midst furs and silks and jewels sheen,
     He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
     The centre of the glittering ring,--
     And Snowdoun's Knight is Scotland's King!


     XXVII.

     As wreath of snow on mountain-breast
     Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
     Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
     And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
     No word her choking voice commands,--
     She showed the ring,--she clasped her hands.
     O, not a moment could he brook,
     The generous Prince, that suppliant look!
     Gently he raised her,--and, the while,
     Checked with a glance the circle's smile;
     Graceful, but grave, her brow he kissed,
     And bade her terrors be dismissed:--
     'Yes, fair; the wandering poor
     Fitz-James The fealty of Scotland claims.
     To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
     He will redeem his signet ring.
     Ask naught for Douglas;--yester even,
     His Prince and he have much forgiven;
     Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue,
     I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.
     We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
     Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
     Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
     Our council aided and our laws.
     I stanched thy father's death-feud stern
     With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
     And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
     The friend and bulwark of our throne.--
     But, lovely infidel, how now?
     What clouds thy misbelieving brow?
     Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
     Thou must confirm this doubting maid.'


     XXVIII.

     Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
     And on his neck his daughter hung.
     The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
     The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
     When it can say with godlike voice,
     Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!
     Yet would not James the general eye
     On nature's raptures long should pry;
     He stepped between--' Nay, Douglas, nay,
     Steal not my proselyte away!
     The riddle 'tis my right to read,
     That brought this happy chance to speed.
     Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
     In life's more low but happier way,
     'Tis under name which veils my power
     Nor falsely veils,--for Stirling's tower
     Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
     And Normans call me James Fitz-James.
     Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
     Thus learn to right the injured cause.'
     Then, in a tone apart and low,--
     'Ah, little traitress! none must know
     What idle dream, what lighter thought
     What vanity full dearly bought,
     Joined to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
     My spell-bound steps to Benvenue
     In dangerous hour, and all but gave
     Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!'
     Aloud he spoke: 'Thou still dost hold
     That little talisman of gold,
     Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring,--
     What seeks fair Ellen of the King?'


     XXIX.

     Full well the conscious maiden guessed
     He probed the weakness of her breast;
     But with that consciousness there came
     A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
     And more she deemed the Monarch's ire
     Kindled 'gainst him who for her sire
     Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
     And, to her generous feeling true,
     She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu.
     'Forbear thy suit;--the King of kings
     Alone can stay life's parting wings.
     I know his heart, I know his hand,
     Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;
     My fairest earldom would I give
     To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
     Hast thou no other boon to crave?
     No other captive friend to save?'
     Blushing, she turned her from the King,
     And to the Douglas gave the ring,
     As if she wished her sire to speak
     The suit that stained her glowing cheek.
     'Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
     And stubborn justice holds her course.
     Malcolm, come forth!'--and, at the word,
     Down kneeled the Graeme to Scotland's Lord.
     'For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
     From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
     Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
     Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
     And sought amid thy faithful clan
     A refuge for an outlawed man,
     Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
     Fetters and warder for the Graeme!'
     His chain of gold the King unstrung,
     The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
     Then gently drew the glittering band,
     And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.

     Harp of the North, farewell! The hills grow dark,
          On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
     In twilight copse the glow-worm lights her spark,
          The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.
     Resume thy wizard elm! the fountain lending,
          And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
     Thy numbers sweet with nature's vespers blending,
          With distant echo from the fold and lea,
     And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing bee.

     Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!
          Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway,
     And little reck I of the censure sharp
          May idly cavil at an idle lay.
     Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
          Through secret woes the world has never known,
     When on the weary night dawned wearier day,
          And bitterer was the grief devoured alone.--
     That I o'erlive such woes, Enchantress! is thine own.

     Hark! as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
          Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!
     'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire,
          'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.
     Receding now, the dying numbers ring
          Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell;
     And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
          A wandering witch-note of the distant spell--
     And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!

VOLUME I.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTORY


The title of this work has not been chosen without the grave and solid
deliberation which matters of importance demand from the prudent. Even
its first, or general denomination, was the result of no common research
or selection, although, according to the example of my predecessors, I
had only to seize upon the most sounding and euphonic surname that
English history or topography affords, and elect it at once as the title
of my work and the name of my hero. But, alas! what could my readers have
expected from the chivalrous epithets of Howard, Mordaunt, Mortimer, or
Stanley, or from the softer and more sentimental sounds of Belmour,
Belville, Belfield, and Belgrave, but pages of inanity, similar to those
which have been so christened for half a century past? I must modestly
admit I am too diffident of my own merit to place it in unnecessary
opposition to preconceived associations; I have, therefore, like a maiden
knight with his white shield, assumed for my hero, WAVERLEY, an
uncontaminated name, bearing with its sound little of good or evil,
excepting what the reader shall hereafter be pleased to affix to it. But
my second or supplemental title was a matter of much more difficult
election, since that, short as it is, may be held as pledging the author
to some special mode of laying his scene, drawing his characters, and
managing his adventures. Had I, for example, announced in my
frontispiece, â€˜Waverley, a Tale of other Days,â€™ must not every
novel-reader have anticipated a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho,
of which the eastern wing had long been uninhabited, and the keys either
lost, or consigned to the care of some aged butler or housekeeper, whose
trembling steps, about the middle of the second volume, were doomed to
guide the hero, or heroine, to the ruinous precincts? Would not the owl
have shrieked and the cricket cried in my very title-page? and could it
have been possible for me, with a moderate attention to decorum, to
introduce any scene more lively than might be produced by the jocularity
of a clownish but faithful valet, or the garrulous narrative of the
heroineâ€™s fille-de-chambre, when rehearsing the stories of blood and
horror which she had heard in the servantsâ€™ hall? Again, had my title
borne, â€˜Waverley, a Romance from the German,â€™ what head so obtuse as not
to image forth a profligate abbot, an oppressive duke, a secret and
mysterious association of Rosycrucians and Illuminati, with all their
properties of black cowls, caverns, daggers, electrical machines,
trap-doors, and dark-lanterns? Or if I had rather chosen to call my work
a â€˜Sentimental Tale,â€™ would it not have been a sufficient presage of a
heroine with a profusion of auburn hair, and a harp, the soft solace of
her solitary hours, which she fortunately finds always the means of
transporting from castle to cottage, although she herself be sometimes
obliged to jump out of a two-pair-of-stairs window, and is more than once
bewildered on her journey, alone and on foot, without any guide but a
blowzy peasant girl, whose jargon she hardly can understand? Or, again,
if my Waverley had been entitled â€˜A Tale of the Times,â€™ wouldst thou not,
gentle reader, have demanded from me a dashing sketch of the fashionable
world, a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled, and if
lusciously painted, so much the better? a heroine from Grosvenor Square,
and a hero from the Barouche Club or the Four-in-Hand, with a set of
subordinate characters from the elegantes of Queen Anne Street East, or
the dashing heroes of the Bow-Street Office? I could proceed in proving
the importance of a title-page, and displaying at the same time my own
intimate knowledge of the particular ingredients necessary to the
composition of romances and novels of various descriptions;--but it is
enough, and I scorn to tyrannise longer over the impatience of my reader,
who is doubtless already anxious to know the choice made by an author so
profoundly versed in the different branches of his art.

By fixing, then, the date of my story Sixty Years before this present 1st
November, 1805, I would have my readers understand, that they will meet
in the following pages neither a romance of chivalry nor a tale of modern
manners; that my hero will neither have iron on his shoulders, as of
yore, nor on the heels of his boots, as is the present fashion of Bond
Street; and that my damsels will neither be clothed â€˜in purple and in
pall,â€™ like the Lady Alice of an old ballad, nor reduced to the primitive
nakedness of a modern fashionable at a rout. From this my choice of an
era the understanding critic may farther presage that the object of my
tale is more a description of men than manners. A tale of manners, to be
interesting, must either refer to antiquity so great as to have become
venerable, or it must bear a vivid reflection of those scenes which are
passing daily before our eyes, and are interesting from their novelty.
Thus the coat-of-mail of our ancestors, and the triple-furred pelisse of
our modern beaux, may, though for very different reasons, be equally fit
for the array of a fictitious character; but who, meaning the costume of
his hero to be impressive, would willingly attire him in the court dress
of George the Secondâ€™s reign, with its no collar, large sleeves, and low
pocket-holes? The same may be urged, with equal truth, of the Gothic
hall, which, with its darkened and tinted windows, its elevated and
gloomy roof, and massive oaken table garnished with boarâ€™s-head and
rosemary, pheasants and peacocks, cranes and cygnets, has an excellent
effect in fictitious description. Much may also be gained by a lively
display of a modern fete, such as we have daily recorded in that part of
a newspaper entitled the Mirror of Fashion, if we contrast these, or
either of them, with the splendid formality of an entertainment given
Sixty Years Since; and thus it will be readily seen how much the painter
of antique or of fashionable manners gains over him who delineates those
of the last generation.

Considering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject, I
must be understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as possible, by
throwing the force of my narrative upon the characters and passions of
the actors;--those passions common to men in all stages of society, and
which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it throbbed under the
steel corslet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded coat of the
eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present
day. [Footnote: Alas! that attire, respectable and gentlemanlike in 1805,
or thereabouts, is now as antiquated as the Author of Waverley has
himself become since that period! The reader of fashion will please to
fill up the costume with an embroidered waistcoat of purple velvet or
silk, and a coat of whatever colour he pleases.] Upon these passions it
is no doubt true that the state of manners and laws casts a necessary
colouring; but the bearings, to use the language of heraldry, remain the
same, though the tincture may be not only different, but opposed in
strong contradistinction. The wrath of our ancestors, for example, was
coloured gules; it broke forth in acts of open and sanguinary violence
against the objects of its fury. Our malignant feelings, which must seek
gratification through more indirect channels, and undermine the obstacles
which they cannot openly bear down, may be rather said to be tinctured
sable. But the deep-ruling impulse is the same in both cases; and the
proud peer, who can now only ruin his neighbour according to law, by
protracted suits, is the genuine descendant of the baron who wrapped the
castle of his competitor in flames, and knocked him on the head as he
endeavoured to escape from the conflagration. It is from the great book
of Nature, the same through a thousand editions, whether of black-letter,
or wire-wove and hot-pressed, that I have venturously essayed to read a
chapter to the public. Some favourable opportunities of contrast have
been afforded me by the state of society in the northern part of the
island at the period of my history, and may serve at once to vary and to
illustrate the moral lessons, which I would willingly consider as the
most important part of my plan; although I am sensible how short these
will fall of their aim if I shall be found unable to mix them with
amusement--a task not quite so easy in this critical generation as it was
â€˜Sixty Years Since.â€™




CHAPTER II

WAVERLEY-HONOUR--A RETROSPECT


It is, then, sixty years since Edward Waverley, the hero of the following
pages, took leave of his family, to join the regiment of dragoons in
which he had lately obtained a commission. It was a melancholy day at
Waverley-Honour when the young officer parted with Sir Everard, the
affectionate old uncle to whose title and estate he was presumptive heir.

A difference in political opinions had early separated the Baronet from
his younger brother Richard Waverley, the father of our hero. Sir Everard
had inherited from his sires the whole train of Tory or High-Church
predilections and prejudices which had distinguished the house of
Waverley since the Great Civil War. Richard, on the contrary, who was ten
years younger, beheld himself born to the fortune of a second brother,
and anticipated neither dignity nor entertainment in sustaining the
character of Will Wimble. He saw early that, to succeed in the race of
life, it was necessary he should carry as little weight as possible.
Painters talk of the difficulty of expressing the existence of compound
passions in the same features at the same moment; it would be no less
difficult for the moralist to analyse the mixed motives which unite to
form the impulse of our actions. Richard Waverley read and satisfied
himself from history and sound argument that, in the words of the old
song,

Passive obedience was a jest,
And pshaw! was non-resistance;

yet reason would have probably been unable to combat and remove
hereditary prejudice could Richard have anticipated that his elder
brother, Sir Everard, taking to heart an early disappointment, would have
remained a bachelor at seventy-two. The prospect of succession, however
remote, might in that case have led him to endure dragging through the
greater part of his life as â€˜Master Richard at the Hall, the Baronetâ€™s
brother,â€™ in the hope that ere its conclusion he should be distinguished
as Sir Richard Waverley of Waverley-Honour, successor to a princely
estate, and to extended political connections as head of the county
interest in the shire where it lay.

But this was a consummation of things not to be expected at Richardâ€™s
outset, when Sir Everard was in the prime of life, and certain to be an
acceptable suitor in almost any family, whether wealth or beauty should
be the object of his pursuit, and when, indeed, his speedy marriage was a
report which regularly amused the neighbourhood once a year. His younger
brother saw no practicable road to independence save that of relying upon
his own exertions, and adopting a political creed more consonant both to
reason and his own interest than the hereditary faith of Sir Everard in
High-Church and in the house of Stuart. He therefore read his recantation
at the beginning of his career, and entered life as an avowed Whig and
friend of the Hanover succession.

The ministry of George the Firstâ€™s time were prudently anxious to
diminish the phalanx of opposition. The Tory nobility, depending for
their reflected lustre upon the sunshine of a court, had for some time
been gradually reconciling themselves to the new dynasty. But the wealthy
country gentlemen of England, a rank which retained, with much of ancient
manners and primitive integrity, a great proportion of obstinate and
unyielding prejudice, stood aloof in haughty and sullen opposition, and
cast many a look of mingled regret and hope to Bois le Due, Avignon, and
Italy. [Footnote: Where the Chevalier St. George, or, as he was termed,
the Old Pretender, held his exiled court, as his situation compelled him
to shift his place of residence.] The accession of the near relation of
one of those steady and inflexible opponents was considered as a means of
bringing over more converts, and therefore Richard Waverley met with a
share of ministerial favour more than proportioned to his talents or his
political importance. It was, however, discovered that he had respectable
talents for public business, and the first admittance to the ministerâ€™s
levee being negotiated, his success became rapid. Sir Everard learned
from the public â€˜News-Letter,â€™ first, that Richard Waverley, Esquire, was
returned for the ministerial borough of Barterfaith; next, that Richard
Waverley, Esquire, had taken a distinguished part in the debate upon the
Excise Bill in the support of government; and, lastly, that Richard
Waverley, Esquire, had been honoured with a seat at one of those boards
where the pleasure of serving the country is combined with other
important gratifications, which, to render them the more acceptable,
occur regularly once a quarter.

Although these events followed each other so closely that the sagacity of
the editor of a modern newspaper would have presaged the two last even
while he announced the first, yet they came upon Sir Everard gradually,
and drop by drop, as it were, distilled through the cool and
procrastinating alembic of Dyerâ€™s â€˜Weekly Letter.â€™ [Footnote: See Note I.
] For it may be observed in passing, that instead of those mail-coaches,
by means of which every mechanic at his six-penny club, may nightly learn
from twenty contradictory channels the yesterdayâ€™s news of the capital, a
weekly post brought, in those days, to Waverley-Honour, a Weekly
Intelligencer, which, after it had gratified Sir Everardâ€™s curiosity, his
sisterâ€™s, and that of his aged butler, was regularly transferred from the
Hall to the Rectory, from the Rectory to Squire Stubbsâ€™s at the Grange,
from the Squire to the Baronetâ€™s steward at his neat white house on the
heath, from the steward to the bailiff, and from him through a huge
circle of honest dames and gaffers, by whose hard and horny hands it was
generally worn to pieces in about a month after its arrival.

This slow succession of intelligence was of some advantage to Richard
Waverley in the case before us; for, had the sum total of his enormities
reached the ears of Sir Everard at once, there can be no doubt that the
new commissioner would have had little reason to pique himself on the
success of his politics. The Baronet, although the mildest of human
beings, was not without sensitive points in his character; his brotherâ€™s
conduct had wounded these deeply; the Waverley estate was fettered by no
entail (for it had never entered into the head of any of its former
possessors that one of their progeny could be guilty of the atrocities
laid by Dyerâ€™s â€˜Letterâ€™ to the door of Richard), and if it had, the
marriage of the proprietor might have been fatal to a collateral heir.
These various ideas floated through the brain of Sir Everard without,
however, producing any determined conclusion.

He examined the tree of his genealogy, which, emblazoned with many an
emblematic mark of honour and heroic achievement, hung upon the
well-varnished wainscot of his hall. The nearest descendants of Sir
Hildebrand Waverley, failing those of his eldest son Wilfred, of whom Sir
Everard and his brother were the only representatives, were, as this
honoured register informed him (and, indeed, as he himself well knew),
the Waverleys of Highley Park, com. Hants;   with whom the main branch,
or rather stock, of the house had renounced all connection since the
great law-suit in 1670.

This degenerate scion had committed a farther offence against the head
and source of their gentility, by the intermarriage of their
representative with Judith, heiress of Oliver Bradshawe, of Highley Park,
whose arms, the same with those of Bradshawe the  regicide, they had
quartered with the ancient coat of Waverley. These offences, however, had
vanished from Sir Everardâ€™s recollection in the heat of his resentment;
and had Lawyer Clippurse, for whom his groom was despatched express,
arrived but an hour earlier, he might have had the benefit of drawing a
new settlement of the lordship and manor of Waverley-Honour, with all its
dependencies. But an hour of cool reflection is a great matter when
employed in weighing the comparative evil of two measures to neither of
which we are internally partial. Lawyer Clippurse found his patron
involved in a deep study, which he was too respectful to disturb,
otherwise than by producing his paper and leathern ink-case, as prepared
to minute his honourâ€™s commands. Even this slight manoeuvre was
embarrassing to Sir Everard, who felt it as a reproach to his indecision.
He looked at the attorney with some desire to issue his fiat, when the
sun, emerging from behind a cloud, poured at once its chequered light
through the stained window of the gloomy cabinet in which they were
seated. The Baronetâ€™s eye, as he raised it to the splendour, fell right
upon the central scutcheon, inpressed with the same device which his
ancestor was said to have borne in the field of Hastings,--three ermines
passant, argent, in a field azure, with its appropriate motto, Sans
tache. â€˜May our name rather perish,â€™ exclaimed Sir Everard, â€˜than that
ancient and loyal symbol should be blended with the dishonoured insignia
of a traitorous Roundhead!â€™

All this was the effect of the glimpse of a sunbeam, just sufficient to
light Lawyer Clippurse to mend his pen. The pen was mended in vain. The
attorney was dismissed, with directions to hold himself in readiness on
the first summons.

The apparition of Lawyer Clippurse at the Hall occasioned much
speculation in that portion of the world to which Waverley-Honour formed
the centre. But the more judicious politicians of this microcosm augured
yet worse consequences to Richard Waverley from a movement which shortly
followed his apostasy. This was no less than an excursion of the Baronet
in his coach-and-six, with four attendants in rich liveries, to make a
visit of some duration to a noble peer on the confines of the shire, of
untainted descent, steady Tory principles, and the happy father of six
unmarried and accomplished daughters.

Sir Everardâ€™s reception in this family was, as it may be easily
conceived, sufficiently favourable; but of the six young ladies, his
taste unfortunately determined him in favour of Lady Emily, the youngest,
who received his attentions with an embarrassment which showed at once
that she durst not decline them, and that they afforded her anything but
pleasure.

Sir Everard could not but perceive something uncommon in the restrained
emotions which the young lady testified at the advances he hazarded; but,
assured by the prudent Countess that they were the natural effects of a
retired education, the sacrifice might have been completed, as doubtless
has happened in many similar instances, had it not been for the courage
of an elder sister, who revealed to the wealthy suitor that Lady Emilyâ€™s
affections were fixed upon a young soldier of fortune, a near relation of
her own.

Sir Everard manifested great emotion on receiving this intelligence,
which was confirmed to him, in a private interview, by the young lady
herself, although under the most dreadful apprehensions of her fatherâ€™s
indignation.

Honour and generosity were hereditary attributes of the house of
Waverley. With a grace and delicacy worthy the hero of a romance, Sir
Everard withdrew his claim to the hand of Lady Emily. He had even, before
leaving Blandeville Castle, the address to extort from her father a
consent to her union with the object of her choice. What arguments he
used on this point cannot exactly be known, for Sir Everard was never
supposed strong in the powers of persuasion; but the young officer,
immediately after this transaction, rose in the army with a rapidity far
surpassing the usual pace of unpatronised professional merit, although,
to outward appearance, that was all he had to depend upon.

The shock which Sir Everard encountered upon this occasion, although
diminished by the consciousness of having acted virtuously and generously
had its effect upon his future life. His resolution of marriage had been
adopted in a fit of indignation; the labour of courtship did not quite
suit the dignified indolence of his habits; he had but just escaped the
risk of marrying a woman who could never love him, and his pride could
not be greatly flattered by the termination of his amour, even if his
heart had not suffered. The result of the whole matter was his return to
Waverley-Honour without any transfer of his affections, notwithstanding
the sighs and languishments of the fair tell-tale, who had revealed, in
mere sisterly affection, the secret of Lady Emilyâ€™s attachment, and in
despite of the nods, winks, and innuendos of the officious lady mother,
and the grave eulogiums which the Earl pronounced successively on the
prudence, and good sense, and admirable dispositions, of his first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth daughters.

The memory of his unsuccessful amour was with Sir Everard, as with many
more of his temper, at once shy, proud, sensitive, and indolent, a beacon
against exposing himself to similar mortification, pain, and fruitless
exertion for the time to come. He continued to live at Waverley-Honour in
the style of an old English gentleman, of an ancient descent and opulent
fortune. His sister, Miss Rachel Waverley, presided at his table; and
they became, by degrees, an old bachelor and an ancient maiden lady, the
gentlest and kindest of the votaries of celibacy.

The vehemence of Sir Everardâ€™s resentment against his brother was but
short-lived; yet his dislike to the Whig and the placeman, though unable
to stimulate him to resume any active measures prejudicial to Richardâ€™s
interest, in the succession to the family estate, continued to maintain
the coldness between them. Richard knew enough of the world, and of his
brotherâ€™s temper, to believe that by any ill-considered or precipitate
advances on his part, he might turn passive dislike into a more active
principle. It was accident, therefore, which at length occasioned a
renewal of their intercourse. Richard had married a young woman of rank,
by whose family interest and private fortune he hoped to advance his
career. In her right he became possessor of a manor of some value, at the
distance of a few miles from Waverley-Honour.

Little Edward, the hero of our tale, then in his fifth year, was their
only child. It chanced that the infant with his maid had strayed one
morning to a mileâ€™s distance from the avenue of Brerewood Lodge, his
fatherâ€™s seat. Their attention was attracted by a carriage drawn by six
stately long-tailed black horses, and with as much carving and gilding as
would have done honour to my lord mayorâ€™s. It was waiting for the owner,
who was at a little distance inspecting the progress of a half-built
farm-house. I know not whether the boyâ€™s nurse had been a Welsh--or a
Scotch-woman, or in what manner he associated a shield emblazoned with
three ermines with the idea of personal property, but he no sooner beheld
this family emblem than he stoutly determined on vindicating his right to
the splendid vehicle on which it was displayed. The Baronet arrived while
the boyâ€™s maid was in vain endeavouring to make him desist from his
determination to appropriate the gilded coach-and-six. The rencontre was
at a happy moment for Edward, as his uncle had been just eyeing
wistfully, with something of a feeling like envy, the chubby boys of the
stout yeoman whose mansion was building by his direction. In the
round-faced rosy cherub before him, bearing his eye and his name, and
vindicating a hereditary title to his family, affection, and patronage,
by means of a tie which Sir Everard held as sacred as either Garter or
Blue-mantle, Providence seemed to have granted to him the very object
best calculated to fill up the void in his hopes and affections. Sir
Everard returned to Waverley-Hall upon a led horse, which was kept in
readiness for him, while the child and his attendant were sent home in
the carriage to Brerewood Lodge, with such a message as opened to Richard
Waverley a door of reconciliation with his elder brother.

Their intercourse, however, though thus renewed, continued to be rather
formal and civil than partaking of brotherly cordiality; yet it was
sufficient to the wishes of both parties. Sir Everard obtained, in the
frequent society of his little nephew, something on which his hereditary
pride might found the anticipated pleasure of a continuation of his
lineage, and where his kind and gentle affections could at the same time
fully exercise themselves. For Richard Waverley, he beheld in the growing
attachment between the uncle and nephew the means of securing his sonâ€™s,
if not his own, succession to the hereditary estate, which he felt would
be rather endangered than promoted by any attempt on his own part towards
a closer intimacy with a man of Sir Everardâ€™s habits and opinions.

Thus, by a sort of tacit compromise, little Edward was permitted to pass
the greater part of the year at the Hall, and appeared to stand in the
same intimate relation to both families, although their mutual
intercourse was otherwise limited to formal messages and more formal
visits. The education of the youth was regulated alternately by the taste
and opinions of his uncle and of his father. But more of this in a
subsequent chapter.




CHAPTER III

EDUCATION


The education of our hero, Edward Waverley, was of a nature somewhat
desultory. In infancy his health suffered, or was supposed to suffer
(which is quite the same thing), by the air of London. As soon,
therefore, as official duties, attendance on Parliament, or the
prosecution of any of his plans of interest or ambition, called his
father to town, which was his usual residence for eight months in the
year, Edward was transferred to Waverley-Honour, and experienced a total
change of instructors and of lessons, as well as of residence. This might
have been remedied had his father placed him under the superintendence of
a permanent tutor. But he considered that one of his choosing would
probably have been unacceptable at Waverley-Honour, and that such a
selection as Sir Everard might have made, were the matter left to him,
would have burdened him with a disagreeable inmate, if not a political
spy, in his family. He therefore prevailed upon his private secretary, a
young man of taste and accomplishments, to bestow an hour or two on
Edwardâ€™s education while at Brerewood Lodge, and left his uncle
answerable for his improvement in literature while an inmate at the Hall.
This was in some degree respectably provided for. Sir Everardâ€™s chaplain,
an Oxonian, who had lost his fellowship for declining to take the oaths
at the accession of George I, was not only an excellent classical
scholar, but reasonably skilled in science, and master of most modern
languages. He was, however, old and indulgent, and the recurring
interregnum, during which Edward was entirely freed from his discipline,
occasioned such a relaxation of authority, that the youth was permitted,
in a great measure, to learn as he pleased, what he pleased, and when he
pleased. This slackness of rule might have been ruinous to a boy of slow
understanding, who, feeling labour in the acquisition of knowledge, would
have altogether neglected it, save for the command of a taskmaster; and
it might have proved equally dangerous to a youth whose animal spirits
were more powerful than his imagination or his feelings, and whom the
irresistible influence of Alma would have engaged in field-sports from
morning till night. But the character of Edward Waverley was remote from
either of these. His powers of apprehension were so uncommonly quick as
almost to resemble intuition, and the chief care of his preceptor was to
prevent him, as a sportsman would phrase it, from over-running his
game--that is, from acquiring his knowledge in a slight, flimsy, and
inadequate manner. And here the instructor had to combat another
propensity too often united with brilliancy of fancy and vivacity of
talent--that indolence, namely, of disposition, which can only be stirred
by some strong motive of gratification, and which renounces study as soon
as curiosity is gratified, the pleasure of conquering the first
difficulties exhausted, and the novelty of pursuit at an end. Edward
would throw himself with spirit upon any classical author of which his
preceptor proposed the perusal, make himself master of the style so far
as to understand the story, and, if that pleased or interested him, he
finished the volume. But it was in vain to attempt fixing his attention
on critical distinctions of philology, upon the difference of idiom, the
beauty of felicitous expression, or the artificial combinations of
syntax. â€˜I can read and understand a Latin author,â€™ said young Edward,
with the self-confidence and rash reasoning of fifteen, â€˜and Scaliger or
Bentley could not do much more.â€™ Alas! while he was thus permitted to
read only for the gratification of his amusement, he foresaw not that he
was losing for ever the opportunity of acquiring habits of firm and
assiduous application, of gaining the art of controlling, directing, and
concentrating the powers of his mind for earnest investigation--an art
far more essential than even that intimate acquaintance with classical
learning which is the primary object of study.

I am aware I may be here reminded of the necessity of rendering
instruction agreeable to youth, and of Tassoâ€™s infusion of honey into the
medicine prepared for a child; but an age in which children are taught
the driest doctrines by the insinuating method of instructive games, has
little reason to dread the consequences of study being rendered too
serious or severe. The history of England is now reduced to a game at
cards, the problems of mathematics to puzzles and riddles, and the
doctrines of arithmetic may, we are assured, be sufficiently acquired by
spending a few hours a week at a new and complicated edition of the Royal
Game of the Goose. There wants but one step further, and the Creed and
Ten Commandments may be taught in the same manner, without the necessity
of the grave face, deliberate tone of recital, and devout attention,
hitherto exacted from the well-governed childhood of this realm. It may,
in the meantime, be subject of serious consideration, whether those who
are accustomed only to acquire instruction through the medium of
amusement may not be brought to reject that which approaches under the
aspect of study; whether those who learn history by the cards may not be
led to prefer the means to the end; and whether, were we to teach
religion in the way of sport, our pupils may not thereby be gradually
induced to make sport of their religion. To our young hero, who was
permitted to seek his instruction only according to the bent of his own
mind, and who, of consequence, only sought it so long as it afforded him
amusement, the indulgence of his tutors was attended with evil
consequences, which long continued to influence his character, happiness,
and utility.

Edwardâ€™s power of imagination and love of literature, although the former
was vivid and the latter ardent, were so far from affording a remedy to
this peculiar evil, that they rather inflamed and increased its violence.
The library at Waverley-Honour, a large Gothic room, with double arches
and a gallery, contained such a miscellaneous and extensive collection of
volumes as had been assembled together, during the course of two hundred
years, by a family which had been always wealthy, and inclined, of
course, as a mark of splendour, to furnish their shelves with the current
literature of the day, without much scrutiny or nicety of discrimination.
Throughout this ample realm Edward was permitted to roam at large. His
tutor had his own studies; and church politics and controversial
divinity, together with a love of learned ease, though they did not
withdraw his attention at stated times from the progress of his patronâ€™s
presumptive heir, induced him readily to grasp at any apology for not
extending a strict and regulated survey towards his general studies. Sir
Everard had never been himself a student, and, like his sister, Miss
Rachel Waverley, he held the common doctrine, that idleness is
incompatible with reading of any kind, and that the mere tracing the
alphabetical characters with the eye is in itself a useful and
meritorious task, without scrupulously considering what ideas or
doctrines they may happen to convey. With a desire of amusement,
therefore, which better discipline might soon have converted into a
thirst for knowledge, young Waverley drove through the sea of books like
a vessel without a pilot or a rudder. Nothing perhaps increases by
indulgence more than a desultory habit of reading, especially under such
opportunities of gratifying it. I believe one reason why such numerous
instances of erudition occur among the lower ranks is, that, with the
same powers of mind, the poor student is limited to a narrow circle for
indulging his passion for books, and must necessarily make himself master
of the few he possesses ere he can acquire more. Edward, on the contrary,
like the epicure who only deigned to take a single morsel from the sunny
side of a peach, read no volume a moment after it ceased to excite his
curiosity or interest; and it necessarily happened, that the habit of
seeking only this sort of gratification rendered it daily more difficult
of attainment, till the passion for reading, like other strong appetites,
produced by indulgence a sort of satiety.

Ere he attained this indifference, however, he had read, and stored in a
memory of uncommon tenacity, much curious, though ill-arranged and
miscellaneous information. In English literature he was master of
Shakespeare and Milton, of our earlier dramatic authors, of many
picturesque and interesting passages from our old historical chronicles,
and was particularly well acquainted with Spenser, Drayton, and other
poets who have exercised themselves on romantic fiction, of all themes
the most fascinating to a youthful imagination, before the passions have
roused themselves and demand poetry of a more sentimental description. In
this respect his acquaintance with Italian opened him yet a wider range.
He had perused the numerous romantic poems, which, from the days of
Pulci, have been a favourite exercise of the wits of Italy, and had
sought gratification in the numerous collections of novelle, which were
brought forth by the genius of that elegant though luxurious nation, in
emulation of the â€˜Decameron.â€™ In classical literature, Waverley had made
the usual progress, and read the usual authors; and the French had
afforded him an almost exhaustless collection of memoirs, scarcely more
faithful than romances, and of romances so well written as hardly to be
distinguished from memoirs. The splendid pages of Froissart, with his
heart-stirring and eye-dazzling descriptions of war and of tournaments,
were among his chief favourites; and from those of Brantome and De la
Noue he learned to compare the wild and loose, yet superstitious,
character of the nobles of the League with the stern, rigid, and
sometimes turbulent disposition of the Huguenot party. The Spanish had
contributed to his stock of chivalrous and romantic lore. The earlier
literature of the northern nations did not escape the study of one who
read rather to awaken the imagination than to benefit the understanding.
And yet, knowing much that is known but to few, Edward Waverley might
justly be considered as ignorant, since he knew little of what adds
dignity to man, and qualifies him to support and adorn an elevated
situation in society.

The occasional attention of his parents might indeed have been of service
to prevent the dissipation of mind incidental to such a desultory course
of reading. But his mother died in the seventh year after the
reconciliation between the brothers, and Richard Waverley himself, who,
after this event, resided more constantly in London, was too much
interested in his own plans of wealth and ambition to notice more
respecting Edward than that he was of a very bookish turn, and probably
destined to be a bishop. If he could have discovered and analysed his
sonâ€™s waking dreams, he would have formed a very different conclusion.




CHAPTER IV

CASTLE-BUILDING


I have already hinted that the dainty, squeamish, and fastidious taste
acquired by a surfeit of idle reading had not only rendered our hero
unfit for serious and sober study, but had even disgusted him in some
degree with that in which he had hitherto indulged.

He was in his sixteenth year when his habits of abstraction and love of
solitude became so much marked as to excite Sir Everardâ€™s affectionate
apprehension. He tried to counterbalance these propensities by engaging
his nephew in field-sports, which had been the chief pleasure of his own
youthful days. But although Edward eagerly carried the gun for one
season, yet when practice had given him some dexterity, the pastime
ceased to afford him amusement.

In the succeeding spring, the perusal of old Isaac Waltonâ€™s fascinating
volume determined Edward to become â€˜a brother of the angle.â€™ But of all
diversions which ingenuity ever devised for the relief of idleness,
fishing is the worst qualified to amuse a man who is at once indolent and
impatient; and our heroâ€™s rod was speedily flung aside. Society and
example, which, more than any other motives, master and sway the natural
bent of our passions, might have had their usual effect upon the youthful
visionary. But the neighbourhood was thinly inhabited, and the home-bred
young squires whom it afforded were not of a class fit to form Edwardâ€™s
usual companions, far less to excite him to emulation in the practice of
those pastimes which composed the serious business of their lives.

There were a few other youths of better education and a more liberal
character, but from their society also our hero was in some degree
excluded. Sir Everard had, upon the death of Queen Anne, resigned his
seat in Parliament, and, as his age increased and the number of his
contemporaries diminished, had gradually withdrawn himself from society;
so that when, upon any particular occasion, Edward mingled with
accomplished and well-educated young men of his own rank and
expectations, he felt an inferiority in their company, not so much from
deficiency of information, as from the want of the skill to command and
to arrange that which he possessed. A deep and increasing sensibility
added to this dislike of society. The idea of having committed the
slightest solecism in politeness, whether real or imaginary, was agony to
him; for perhaps even guilt itself does not impose upon some minds so
keen a sense of shame and remorse, as a modest, sensitive, and
inexperienced youth feels from the consciousness of having neglected
etiquette or excited ridicule. Where we are not at ease, we cannot be
happy; and therefore it is not surprising that Edward Waverley supposed
that he disliked and was unfitted for society, merely because he had not
yet acquired the habit of living in it with ease and comfort, and of
reciprocally giving and receiving pleasure.

The hours he spent with his uncle and aunt were exhausted in listening to
the oft-repeated tale of narrative old age. Yet even there his
imagination, the predominant faculty of his mind, was frequently excited.
Family tradition and genealogical history, upon which much of Sir
Everardâ€™s discourse turned, is the very reverse of amber, which, itself a
valuable substance, usually includes flies, straws, and other trifles;
whereas these studies, being themselves very insignificant and trifling,
do nevertheless serve to perpetuate a great deal of what is rare and
valuable in ancient manners, and to record many curious and minute facts
which could have been preserved and conveyed through no other medium. If,
therefore, Edward Waverley yawned at times over the dry deduction of his
line of ancestors, with their various intermarriages, and inwardly
deprecated the remorseless and protracted accuracy with which the worthy
Sir Everard rehearsed the various degrees of propinquity between the
house of Waverley-Honour and the doughty barons, knights, and squires to
whom they stood allied; if (notwithstanding his obligations to the three
ermines passant) he sometimes cursed in his heart the jargon of heraldry,
its griffins, its moldwarps, its wyverns, and its dragons, with all the
bitterness of Hotspur himself, there were moments when these
communications interested his fancy and rewarded his attention.

The deeds of Wilibert of Waverley in the Holy Land, his long absence and
perilous adventures, his supposed death, and his return on the evening
when the betrothed of his heart had wedded the hero who had protected her
from insult and oppression during his absence; the generosity with which
the Crusader relinquished his claims, and sought in a neighbouring
cloister that peace which passeth not away; [Footnote: See Note 2.]--to
these and similar tales he would hearken till his heart glowed and his
eye glistened. Nor was he less affected when his aunt, Mrs. Rachel,
narrated the sufferings and fortitude of Lady Alice Waverley during the
Great Civil War. The benevolent features of the venerable spinster
kindled into more majestic expression as she told how Charles had, after
the field of Worcester, found a dayâ€™s refuge at Waverley-Honour, and how,
when a troop of cavalry were approaching to search the mansion, Lady
Alice dismissed her youngest son with a handful of domestics, charging
them to make good with their lives an hourâ€™s diversion, that the king
might have that space for escape. â€˜And, God help her,â€™ would Mrs. Rachel
continue, fixing her eyes upon the heroineâ€™s portrait as she spoke, â€˜full
dearly did she purchase the safety of her prince with the life of her
darling child. They brought him here a prisoner, mortally wounded; and
you may trace the drops of his blood from the great hall door along the
little gallery, and up to the saloon, where they laid him down to die at
his motherâ€™s feet. But there was comfort exchanged between them; for he
knew, from the glance of his motherâ€™s eye, that the purpose of his
desperate defence was attained. Ah! I remember,â€™ she continued, â€˜I
remember well to have seen one that knew and loved him. Miss Lucy Saint
Aubin lived and died a maid for his sake, though one of the most
beautiful and wealthy matches in this country; all the world ran after
her, but she wore widowâ€™s mourning all her life for poor William, for
they were betrothed though not married, and died in--I cannot think of
the date; but I remember, in the November of that very year, when she
found herself sinking, she desired to be brought to Waverley-Honour once
more, and visited all the places where she had been with my grand-uncle,
and caused the carpets to be raised that she might trace the impression
of his blood, and if tears could have washed it out, it had not been
there now; for there was not a dry eye in the house. You would have
thought, Edward, that the very trees mourned for her, for their leaves
dropt around her without a gust of wind, and, indeed, she looked like one
that would never see them green again.â€™

From such legends our hero would steal away to indulge the fancies they
excited. In the corner of the large and sombre library, with no other
light than was afforded by the decaying brands on its ponderous and ample
hearth, he would exercise for hours that internal sorcery by which past
or imaginary events are presented in action, as it were, to the eye of
the muser. Then arose in long and fair array the splendour of the bridal
feast at Waverley-Castle; the tall and emaciated form of its real lord,
as he stood in his pilgrimâ€™s weeds, an unnoticed spectator of the
festivities of his supposed heir and intended bride; the electrical shock
occasioned by the discovery; the springing of the vassals to arms; the
astonishment of the bridegroom; the terror and confusion of the bride;
the agony with which Wilibert observed that her heart as well as consent
was in these nuptials; the air of dignity, yet of deep feeling, with
which he flung down the half-drawn sword, and turned away for ever from
the house of his ancestors. Then would he change the scene, and fancy
would at his wish represent Aunt Rachelâ€™s tragedy. He saw the Lady
Waverley seated in her bower, her ear strained to every sound, her heart
throbbing with double agony, now listening to the decaying echo of the
hoofs of the kingâ€™s horse, and when that had died away, hearing in every
breeze that shook the trees of the park, the noise of the remote
skirmish. A distant sound is heard like the rushing of a swoln stream; it
comes nearer, and Edward can plainly distinguish the galloping of horses,
the cries and shouts of men, with straggling pistol-shots between,
rolling forwards to the Hall. The lady starts up--a terrified menial
rushes in--but why pursue such a description?

As living in this ideal world became daily more delectable to our hero,
interruption was disagreeable in proportion. The extensive domain that
surrounded the Hall, which, far exceeding the dimensions of a park, was
usually termed Waverley-Chase, had originally been forest ground, and
still, though broken by extensive glades, in which the young deer were
sporting, retained its pristine and savage character. It was traversed by
broad avenues, in many places half grown up with brush-wood, where the
beauties of former days used to take their stand to see the stag coursed
with greyhounds, or to gain an aim at him with the crossbow. In one spot,
distinguished by a moss-grown Gothic monument, which retained the name of
Queenâ€™s Standing, Elizabeth herself was said to have pierced seven bucks
with her own arrows. This was a very favourite haunt of Waverley. At
other times, with his gun and his spaniel, which served as an apology to
others, and with a book in his pocket, which perhaps served as an apology
to himself, he used to pursue one of these long avenues, which, after an
ascending sweep of four miles, gradually narrowed into a rude and
contracted path through the cliffy and woody pass called Mirkwood Dingle,
and opened suddenly upon a deep, dark, and small lake, named, from the
same cause, Mirkwood-Mere. There stood, in former times, a solitary tower
upon a rock almost surrounded by the water, which had acquired the name
of the Strength of Waverley, because in perilous times it had often been
the refuge of the family. There, in the wars of York and Lancaster, the
last adherents of the Red Rose who dared to maintain her cause carried on
a harassing and predatory warfare, till the stronghold was reduced by the
celebrated Richard of Gloucester. Here, too, a party of Cavaliers long
maintained themselves under Nigel Waverley, elder brother of that William
whose fate Aunt Rachel commemorated. Through these scenes it was that
Edward loved to â€˜chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancy,â€™ and, like a
child among his toys, culled and arranged, from the splendid yet useless
imagery and emblems with which his imagination was stored, visions as
brilliant and as fading as those of an evening sky. The effect of this
indulgence upon his temper and character will appear in the next chapter.




CHAPTER V

CHOICE OF A PROFESSION


From the minuteness with which I have traced Waverleyâ€™s pursuits, and the
bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader
may perhaps anticipate, in the following tale, an imitation of the
romance of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the
supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable
author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues
the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common
aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in
their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic
tone and colouring. So far was Edward Waverley from expecting general
sympathy with his own feelings, or concluding that the present state of
things was calculated to exhibit the reality of those visions in which he
loved to indulge, that he dreaded nothing more than the detection of such
sentiments as were dictated by his musings. He neither had nor wished to
have a confidant, with whom to communicate his reveries; and so sensible
was he of the ridicule attached to them, that, had he been to choose
between any punishment short of ignominy, and the necessity of giving a
cold and composed account of the ideal world in which he lived the better
part of his days, I think he would not have hesitated to prefer the
former infliction. This secrecy became doubly precious as he felt in
advancing life the influence of the awakening passions. Female forms of
exquisite grace and beauty began to mingle in his mental adventures; nor
was he long without looking abroad to compare the creatures of his own
imagination with the females of actual life.

The list of the beauties who displayed their hebdomadal finery at the
parish church of Waverley was neither numerous nor select. By far the
most passable was Miss Sissly, or, as she rather chose to be called, Miss
Cecilia Stubbs, daughter of Squire Stubbs at the Grange. I know not
whether it was by the â€˜merest accident in the world,â€™ a phrase which,
from female lips, does not always exclude malice prepense, or whether it
was from a conformity of taste, that Miss Cecilia more than once crossed
Edward in his favourite walks through Waverley-Chase. He had not as yet
assumed courage to accost her on these occasions; but the meeting was not
without its effect. A romantic lover is a strange idolater, who sometimes
cares not out of what log he frames the object of his adoration; at
least, if nature has given that object any passable proportion of
personal charms, he can easily play the Jeweller and Dervise in the
Oriental tale, [Footnote: See Hoppnerâ€™s tale of The Seven Lovers.] and
supply her richly, out of the stores of his own imagination, with
supernatural beauty, and all the properties of intellectual wealth.

But ere the charms of Miss Cecilia Stubbs had erected her into a positive
goddess, or elevated her at least to a level with the saint her namesake,
Mrs. Rachel Waverley gained some intimation which determined her to
prevent the approaching apotheosis. Even the most simple and unsuspicious
of the female sex have (God bless them!) an instinctive sharpness of
perception in such matters, which sometimes goes the length of observing
partialities that never existed, but rarely misses to detect such as pass
actually under their observation. Mrs. Rachel applied herself with great
prudence, not to combat, but to elude, the approaching danger, and
suggested to her brother the necessity that the heir of his house should
see something more of the world than was consistent with constant
residence at Waverley-Honour.

Sir Everard would not at first listen to a proposal which went to
separate his nephew from him. Edward was a little bookish, he admitted,
but youth, he had always heard, was the season for learning, and, no
doubt, when his rage for letters was abated, and his head fully stocked
with knowledge, his nephew would take to field-sports and country
business. He had often, he said, himself regretted that he had not spent
some time in study during his youth: he would neither have shot nor
hunted with less skill, and he might have made the roof of Saint
Stephenâ€™s echo to longer orations than were comprised in those zealous
Noes, with which, when a member of the House during Godolphinâ€™s
administration, he encountered every measure of government.

Aunt Rachelâ€™s anxiety, however, lent her address to carry her point.
Every representative of their house had visited foreign parts, or served
his country in the army, before he settled for life at Waverley-Honour,
and she appealed for the truth of her assertion to the genealogical
pedigree, an authority which Sir Everard was never known to contradict.
In short, a proposal was made to Mr. Richard Waverley, that his son
should travel, under the direction of his present tutor Mr. Pembroke,
with a suitable allowance from the Baronetâ€™s liberality. The father
himself saw no objection to this overture; but upon mentioning it
casually at the table of the minister, the great man looked grave. The
reason was explained in private. The unhappy turn of Sir Everardâ€™s
politics, the minister observed, was such as would render it highly
improper that a young gentleman of such hopeful prospects should travel
on the Continent with a tutor doubtless of his uncleâ€™s choosing, and
directing his course by his instructions. What might Mr. Edward
Waverleyâ€™s society be at Paris, what at Rome, where all manner of snares
were spread by the Pretender and his sons--these were points for Mr.
Waverley to consider. This he could himself say, that he knew his Majesty
had such a just sense of Mr. Richard Waverleyâ€™s merits, that, if his son
adopted the army for a few years, a troop, he believed, might be reckoned
upon in one of the dragoon regiments lately returned from Flanders.

A hint thus conveyed and enforced was not to be neglected with impunity;
and Richard Waverley, though with great dread of shocking his brotherâ€™s
prejudices, deemed he could not avoid accepting the commission thus
offered him for his son. The truth is, he calculated much, and justly,
upon Sir Everardâ€™s fondness for Edward, which made him unlikely to resent
any step that he might take in due submission to parental authority. Two
letters announced this determination to the Baronet and his nephew. The
latter barely communicated the fact, and pointed out the necessary
preparations for joining his regiment. To his brother, Richard was more
diffuse and circuitous. He coincided with him, in the most flattering
manner, in the propriety of his sonâ€™s seeing a little more of the world,
and was even humble in expressions of gratitude for his proposed
assistance; was, however, deeply concerned that it was now,
unfortunately, not in Edwardâ€™s power exactly to comply with the plan
which had been chalked out by his best friend and benefactor. He himself
had thought with pain on the boyâ€™s inactivity, at an age when all his
ancestors had borne arms; even Royalty itself had deigned to inquire
whether young Waverley was not now in Flanders, at an age when his
grandfather was already bleeding for his king in the Great Civil War.
This was accompanied by an offer of a troop of horse. What could he do?
There was no time to consult his brotherâ€™s inclinations, even if he could
have conceived there might be objections on his part to his nephewâ€™s
following the glorious career of his predecessors. And, in short, that
Edward was now (the intermediate steps of cornet and lieutenant being
overleapt with great agility) Captain Waverley, of Gardinerâ€™s regiment of
dragoons, which he must join in their quarters at Dundee in Scotland, in
the course of a month.

Sir Everard Waverley received this intimation with a mixture of feelings.
At the period of the Hanoverian succession he had withdrawn from
parliament, and his conduct in the memorable year 1715 had not been
altogether unsuspected. There were reports of private musters of tenants
and horses in Waverley-Chase by moonlight, and of cases of carbines and
pistols purchased in Holland, and addressed to the Baronet, but
intercepted by the vigilance of a riding officer of the excise, who was
afterwards tossed in a blanket on a moonless night, by an association of
stout yeomen, for his officiousness. Nay, it was even said, that at the
arrest of Sir William Wyndham, the leader of the Tory party, a letter
from Sir Everard was found in the pocket of his night-gown. But there was
no overt act which an attainder could be founded on, and government,
contented with suppressing the insurrection of 1715, felt it neither
prudent nor safe to push their vengeance farther than against those
unfortunate gentlemen who actually took up arms.

Nor did Sir Everardâ€™s apprehensions of personal consequences seem to
correspond with the reports spread among his Whig neighbours. It was well
known that he had supplied with money several of the distressed
Northumbrians and Scotchmen, who, after being made prisoners at Preston
in Lancashire, were imprisoned in Newgate and the Marshalsea, and it was
his solicitor and ordinary counsel who conducted the defence of some of
these unfortunate gentlemen at their trial. It was generally supposed,
however, that, had ministers possessed any real proof of Sir Everardâ€™s
accession to the rebellion, he either would not have ventured thus to
brave the existing government, or at least would not have done so with
impunity. The feelings which then dictated his proceedings were those of
a young man, and at an agitating period. Since that time Sir Everardâ€™s
Jacobitism had been gradually decaying, like a fire which burns out for
want of fuel. His Tory and High-Church principles were kept up by some
occasional exercise at elections and quarter-sessions; but those
respecting hereditary right were fallen into a sort of abeyance. Yet it
jarred severely upon his feelings, that his nephew should go into the
army under the Brunswick dynasty; and the more so, as, independent of his
high and conscientious ideas of paternal authority, it was impossible, or
at least highly imprudent, to interfere authoritatively to prevent it.
This suppressed vexation gave rise to many poohs and pshaws which were
placed to the account of an incipient fit of gout, until, having sent for
the Army List, the worthy Baronet consoled himself with reckoning the
descendants of the houses of genuine loyalty, Mordaunts, Granvilles, and
Stanleys, whose names were to be found in that military record; and,
calling up all his feelings of family grandeur and warlike glory, he
concluded, with logic something like Falstaffâ€™s, that when war was at
hand, although it were shame to be on any side but one, it were worse
shame to be idle than to be on the worst side, though blacker than
usurpation could make it. As for Aunt Rachel, her scheme had not exactly
terminated according to her wishes, but she was under the necessity of
submitting to circumstances; and her mortification was diverted by the
employment she found in fitting out her nephew for the campaign, and
greatly consoled by the prospect of beholding him blaze in complete
uniform. Edward Waverley himself received with animated and undefined
surprise this most unexpected intelligence. It was, as a fine old poem
expresses it, â€˜like a fire to heather set,â€™ that covers a solitary hill
with smoke, and illumines it at the same time with dusky fire. His tutor,
or, I should say, Mr. Pembroke, for he scarce assumed the name of tutor,
picked up about Edwardâ€™s room some fragments of irregular verse, which he
appeared to have composed under the influence of the agitating feelings
occasioned by this sudden page being turned up to him in the book of
life. The doctor, who was a believer in all poetry which was composed by
his friends, and written out in fair straight lines, with a capital at
the beginning of each, communicated this treasure to Aunt Rachel, who,
with her spectacles dimmed with tears, transferred them to her
commonplace book, among choice receipts for cookery and medicine,
favourite texts, and portions from High-Church divines, and a few songs,
amatory and Jacobitical, which she had carolled in her younger days, from
whence her nephewâ€™s poetical tentamina were extracted when the volume
itself, with other authentic records of the Waverley family, were exposed
to the inspection of the unworthy editor of this memorable history. If
they afford the reader no higher amusement, they will serve, at least,
better than narrative of any kind, to acquaint him with the wild and
irregular spirit of our hero:--

Late, when the Autumn evening fell On Mirkwood-Mereâ€™s romantic dell, The
lake returnâ€™d, in chastenâ€™d gleam, The purple cloud, the golden beam:
Reflected in the crystal pool, Headland and bank lay fair and cool; The
weather-tinted rock and tower, Each drooping tree, each fairy flower, So
true, so soft, the mirror gave, As if there lay beneath the wave, Secure
from trouble, toil, and care, A world than earthly world more fair.

But distant winds began to wake, And roused the Genius of the Lake! He
heard the groaning of the oak, And donnâ€™d at once his sable cloak, As
warrior, at the battle-cry, Invests him with his panoply: Then, as the
whirlwind nearer pressâ€™d He â€˜gan to shake his foamy crest Oâ€™er furrowâ€™d
brow and blackenâ€™d cheek, And bade his surge in thunder speak. In wild
and broken eddies whirlâ€™d. Flitted that fond ideal world, And to the
shore in tumult tost The realms of fairy bliss were lost.

Yet, with a stern delight and strange, I saw the spirit-stirring change,
As warrâ€™d the wind with wave and wood, Upon the ruinâ€™d tower I stood, And
felt my heart more strongly bound, Responsive to the lofty sound, While,
joying in the mighty roar, I mournâ€™d that tranquil scene no more.

So, on the idle dreams of youth, Breaks the loud trumpet-call of truth,
Bids each fair vision pass away, Like landscape on the lake that lay, As
fair, as flitting, and as frail, As that which fled the Autumn gale.--For
ever dead to fancyâ€™s eye Be each gay form that glided by, While dreams of
love and ladyâ€™s charms Give place to honour and to arms!

In sober prose, as perhaps these verses intimate less decidedly, the
transient idea of Miss Cecilia Stubbs passed from Captain Waverleyâ€™s
heart amid the turmoil which his new destinies excited. She appeared,
indeed, in full splendour in her fatherâ€™s pew upon the Sunday when he
attended service for the last time at the old parish church, upon which
occasion, at the request of his uncle and Aunt Rachel, he was induced
(nothing both, if the truth must be told) to present himself in full
uniform.

There is no better antidote against entertaining too high an opinion of
others than having an excellent one of ourselves at the very same time.
Miss Stubbs had indeed summoned up every assistance which art could
afford to beauty; but, alas! hoop, patches, frizzled locks, and a new
mantua of genuine French silk, were lost upon a young officer of dragoons
who wore for the first time his gold-laced hat, jack-boots, and
broadsword. I know not whether, like the champion of an old ballad,--

       His heart was all on honour bent,
       He could not stoop to love;
       No lady in the land had power
       His frozen heart to move;

or whether the deep and flaming bars of embroidered gold, which now
fenced his breast, defied the artillery of Ceciliaâ€™s eyes; but every
arrow was launched at him in vain.

    Yet did I mark where Cupidâ€™s shaft did light;
    It lighted not on little western flower,
    But on bold yeoman, flower of all the west,
    Hight Jonas Culbertfield, the stewardâ€™s son.


Craving pardon for my heroics (which I am unable in certain cases to
resist giving way to), it is a melancholy fact, that my history must here
take leave of the fair Cecilia, who, like many a daughter of Eve, after
the departure of Edward, and the dissipation of certain idle visions
which she had adopted, quietly contented herself with a pisaller, and
gave her hand, at the distance of six months, to the aforesaid Jonas, son
of the Baronetâ€™s steward, and heir (no unfertile prospect) to a stewardâ€™s
fortune, besides the snug probability of succeeding to his fatherâ€™s
office. All these advantages moved Squire Stubbs, as much as the ruddy
brown and manly form of the suitor influenced his daughter, to abate
somewhat in the article of their gentry; and so the match was concluded.
None seemed more gratified than Aunt Rachel, who had hitherto looked
rather askance upon the presumptuous damsel (as much so, peradventure, as
her nature would permit), but who, on the first appearance of the
new-married pair at church, honoured the bride with a smile and a
profound curtsy, in presence of the rector, the curate, the clerk, and
the whole congregation of the united parishes of Waverley cum Beverley.

I beg pardon, once and for all, of those readers who take up novels
merely for amusement, for plaguing them so long with old-fashioned
politics, and Whig and Tory, and Hanoverians and Jacobites. The truth is,
I cannot promise them that this story shall be intelligible, not to say
probable, without it. My plan requires that I should explain the motives
on which its action proceeded; and these motives necessarily arose from
the feelings, prejudices, and parties of the times. I do not invite my
fair readers, whose sex and impatience give them the greatest right to
complain of these circumstances, into a flying chariot drawn by
hippogriffs, or moved by enchantment. Mine is a humble English
post-chaise, drawn upon four wheels, and keeping his Majestyâ€™s highway.
Such as dislike the vehicle may leave it at the next halt, and wait for
the conveyance of Prince Husseinâ€™s tapestry, or Malek the Weaverâ€™s flying
sentrybox. Those who are contented to remain with me will be occasionally
exposed to the dulness inseparable from heavy roads, steep hills,
sloughs, and other terrestrial retardations; but with tolerable horses
and a civil driver (as the advertisements have it), I engage to get as
soon as possible into a more picturesque and romantic country, if my
passengers incline to have some patience with me during my first stages.

CHAPTER IV

THE ADIEUS OF WAVERLEY


It was upon the evening of this memorable Sunday that Sir Everard entered
the library, where he narrowly missed surprising our young hero as he
went through the guards of the broadsword with the ancient weapon of old
Sir Hildebrand, which, being preserved as an heirloom, usually hung over
the chimney in the library, beneath a picture of the knight and his
horse, where the features were almost entirely hidden by the knightâ€™s
profusion of curled hair, and the Bucephalus which he bestrode concealed
by the voluminous robes of the Bath with which he was decorated. Sir
Everard entered, and after a glance at the picture and another at his
nephew, began a little speech, which, however, soon dropt into the
natural simplicity of his common manner, agitated upon the present
occasion by no common feeling. â€˜Nephew,â€™ he said; and then, as mending
his phrase, â€˜My dear Edward, it is Godâ€™s will, and also the will of your
father, whom, under God, it is your duty to obey, that you should leave
us to take up the profession of arms, in which so many of your ancestors
have been distinguished. I have made such arrangements as will enable you
to take the field as their descendant, and as the probable heir of the
house of Waverley; and, sir, in the field of battle you will remember
what name you bear. And, Edward, my dear boy, remember also that you are
the last of that race, and the only hope of its revival depends upon you;
therefore, as far as duty and honour will permit, avoid danger--I mean
unnecessary danger--and keep no company with rakes, gamblers, and Whigs,
of whom, it is to be feared, there are but too many in the service into
which you are going. Your colonel, as I am informed, is an excellent
man--for a Presbyterian; but you will remember your duty to God, the
Church of England, and the--â€™ (this breach ought to have been supplied,
according to the rubric, with the word KING; but as, unfortunately, that
word conveyed a double and embarrassing sense, one meaning de facto and
the other de jure, the knight filled up the blank otherwise)--â€˜the Church
of England, and all constituted authorities.â€™ Then, not trusting himself
with any further oratory, he carried his nephew to his stables to see the
horses destined for his campaign. Two were black (the regimental colour),
superb chargers both; the other three were stout active hacks, designed
for the road, or for his domestics, of whom two were to attend him from
the Hall; an additional groom, if necessary, might be picked up in
Scotland.

â€˜You will depart with but a small retinue,â€™ quoth the Baronet, â€˜compared
to Sir Hildebrand, when he mustered before the gate of the Hall a larger
body of horse than your whole regiment consists of. I could have wished
that these twenty young fellows from my estate, who have enlisted in your
troop, had been to march with you on your journey to Scotland. It would
have been something, at least; but I am told their attendance would be
thought unusual in these days, when every new and foolish fashion is
introduced to break the natural dependence of the people upon their
landlords.â€™

Sir Everard had done his best to correct this unnatural disposition of
the times; for he had brightened the chain of attachment between the
recruits and their young captain, not only by a copious repast of beef
and ale, by way of parting feast, but by such a pecuniary donation to
each individual as tended rather to improve the conviviality than the
discipline of their march. After inspecting the cavalry, Sir Everard
again conducted his nephew to the library, where he produced a letter,
carefully folded, surrounded by a little stripe of flox-silk, according
to ancient form, and sealed with an accurate impression of the Waverley
coat-of-arms. It was addressed, with great formality, â€˜To Cosmo Comyne
Bradwardine, Esq., of Bradwardine, at his principal mansion of
Tully-Veolan, in Perthshire, North Britain. These--By the hands of
Captain Edward Waverley, nephew of Sir Everard Waverley, of
Waverley-Honour, Bart.â€™

The gentleman to whom this enormous greeting was addressed, of whom we
shall have more to say in the sequel, had been in arms for the exiled
family of Stuart in the year 1715, and was made prisoner at Preston in
Lancashire. He was of a very ancient family, and somewhat embarrassed
fortune; a scholar, according to the scholarship of Scotchmen, that is,
his learning was more diffuse than accurate, and he was rather a reader
than a grammarian. Of his zeal for the classic authors he is said to have
given an uncommon instance. On the road between Preston and London, he
made his escape from his guards; but being afterwards found loitering
near the place where they had lodged the former night, he was recognised,
and again arrested. His companions, and even his escort, were surprised
at his infatuation, and could not help inquiring, why, being once at
liberty, he had not made the best of his way to a place of safety; to
which he replied, that he had intended to do so, but, in good faith, he
had returned to seek his Titus Livius, which he had forgot in the hurry
of his escape. [Footnote: See Note 3.] The simplicity of this anecdote
struck the gentleman, who, as we before observed, had managed the defence
of some of those unfortunate persons, at the expense of Sir Everard, and
perhaps some others of the party. He was, besides, himself a special
admirer of the old Patavinian, and though probably his own zeal might not
have carried him such extravagant lengths, even to recover the edition of
Sweynheim and Pannartz (supposed to be the princeps), he did not the less
estimate the devotion of the North Briton, and in consequence exerted
himself to so much purpose to remove and soften evidence, detect legal
flaws, et cetera, that he accomplished the final discharge and
deliverance of Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine from certain very awkward
consequences of a plea before our sovereign lord the king in Westminster.

The Baron of Bradwardine, for he was generally so called in Scotland
(although his intimates, from his place of residence, used to denominate
him Tully-Veolan, or more familiarly, Tully), no sooner stood rectus in
curia than he posted down to pay his respects and make his
acknowledgments at Waverley-Honour. A congenial passion for field-sports,
and a general coincidence in political opinions, cemented his friendship
with Sir Everard, notwithstanding the difference of their habits and
studies in other particulars; and, having spent several weeks at
Waverley-Honour, the Baron departed with many expressions of regard,
warmly pressing the Baronet to return his visit, and partake of the
diversion of grouse-shooting, upon his moors in Perthshire next season.
Shortly after, Mr. Bradwardine remitted from Scotland a sum in
reimbursement of expenses incurred in the Kingâ€™s High Court of
Westminster, which, although not quite so formidable when reduced to the
English denomination, had, in its original form of Scotch pounds,
shillings, and pence, such a formidable effect upon the frame of Duncan
Macwheeble, the lairdâ€™s confidential factor, baron-bailie, and man of
resource, that he had a fit of the cholic, which lasted for five days,
occasioned, he said, solely and utterly by becoming the unhappy
instrument of conveying such a serious sum of money out of his native
country into the hands of the false English. But patriotism, as it is the
fairest, so it is often the most suspicious mask of other feelings; and
many who knew Bailie Macwheeble concluded that his professions of regret
were not altogether disinterested, and that he would have grudged the
moneys paid to the LOONS at Westminster much less had they not come from
Bradwardine estate, a fund which he considered as more particularly his
own. But the Bailie protested he was absolutely disinterested--

â€˜Woe, woe, for Scotland, not a whit for me!â€™

The laird was only rejoiced that his worthy friend, Sir Everard Waverley
of Waverley-Honour, was reimbursed of the expenditure which he had
outlaid on account of the house of Bradwardine. It concerned, he said,
the credit of his own family, and of the kingdom of Scotland at large,
that these disbursements should be repaid forthwith, and, if delayed, it
would be a matter of national reproach. Sir Everard, accustomed to treat
much larger sums with indifference, received the remittance of L294, 13S.
6D. without being aware that the payment was an international concern,
and, indeed, would probably have forgot the circumstance altogether, if
Bailie Macwheeble had thought of comforting his cholic by intercepting
the subsidy. A yearly intercourse took place, of a short letter and a
hamper or a cask or two, between Waverley-Honour and Tully-Veolan, the
English exports consisting of mighty cheeses and mightier ale, pheasants,
and venison, and the Scottish returns being vested in grouse, white
hares, pickled salmon, and usquebaugh; all which were meant, sent, and
received as pledges of constant friendship and amity between two
important houses. It followed as a matter of course, that the
heir-apparent of Waverley-Honour could not with propriety visit Scotland
without being furnished with credentials to the Baron of Bradwardine.

When this matter was explained and settled, Mr. Pembroke expressed his
wish to take a private and particular leave of his dear pupil. The good
manâ€™s exhortations to Edward to preserve an unblemished life and morals,
to hold fast the principles of the Christian religion, and to eschew the
profane company of scoffers and latitudinarians, too much abounding in
the army, were not unmingled with his political prejudices. It had
pleased Heaven, he said, to place Scotland (doubtless for the sins of
their ancestors in 1642) in a more deplorable state of darkness than even
this unhappy kingdom of England. Here, at least, although the candlestick
of the Church of England had been in some degree removed from its place,
it yet afforded a glimmering light; there was a hierarchy, though
schismatical, and fallen from the principles maintained by those great
fathers of the church, Sancroft and his brethren; there was a liturgy,
though woefully perverted in some of the principal petitions. But in
Scotland it was utter darkness; and, excepting a sorrowful, scattered,
and persecuted remnant, the pulpits were abandoned to Presbyterians, and,
he feared, to sectaries of every description. It should be his duty to
fortify his dear pupil to resist such unhallowed and pernicious doctrines
in church and state as must necessarily be forced at times upon his
unwilling ears.

Here he produced two immense folded packets, which appeared each to
contain a whole ream of closely written manuscript. They had been the
labour of the worthy manâ€™s whole life; and never were labour and zeal
more absurdly wasted. He had at one time gone to London, with the
intention of giving them to the world, by the medium of a bookseller in
Little Britain, well known to deal in such commodities, and to whom he
was instructed to address himself in a particular phrase and with a
certain sign, which, it seems, passed at that time current among the
initiated Jacobites. The moment Mr. Pembroke had uttered the Shibboleth,
with the appropriate gesture, the bibliopolist greeted him,
notwithstanding every disclamation, by the title of Doctor, and conveying
him into his back shop, after inspecting every possible and impossible
place of concealment, he commenced: â€˜Eh, Doctor!--Well--all under the
rose--snug--I keep no holes here even for a Hanoverian rat to hide in.
And, what--eh! any good news from our friends over the water?--and how
does the worthy King of France?--Or perhaps you are more lately from
Rome? it must be Rome will do it at last--the church must light its
candle at the old lamp.--Eh--what, cautious? I like you the better; but
no fear.â€™ Here Mr. Pembroke with some difficulty stopt a torrent of
interrogations, eked out with signs, nods, and winks; and, having at
length convinced the bookseller that he did him too much honour in
supposing him an emissary of exiled royalty, he explained his actual
business.

The man of books with a much more composed air proceeded to examine the
manuscripts. The title of the first was â€˜A Dissent from Dissenters, or
the Comprehension confuted; showing the Impossibility of any Composition
between the Church and Puritans, Presbyterians, or Sectaries of any
Description; illustrated from the Scriptures, the Fathers of the Church,
and the soundest Controversial Divines.â€™ To this work the bookseller
positively demurred. â€˜Well meant,â€™ he said, â€˜and learned, doubtless; but
the time had gone by. Printed on small-pica it would run to eight hundred
pages, and could never pay. Begged therefore to be excused. Loved and
honoured the true church from his soul, and, had it been a sermon on the
martyrdom, or any twelve-penny touch--why, I would venture something for
the honour of the cloth. But come, letâ€™s see the other. â€œRight Hereditary
righted!â€--Ah! thereâ€™s some sense in this. Hum--hum--hum--pages so many,
paper so much, letter-press--Ah--Iâ€™ll tell you, though, Doctor, you must
knock out some of the Latin and Greek; heavy, Doctor, damnâ€™d heavy--(beg
your pardon) and if you throw in a few grains more pepper--I am he that
never preached my author. I have published for Drake and Charlwood
Lawton, and poor Amhurst [Footnote: See Note 4.]--Ah, Caleb! Caleb! Well,
it was a shame to let poor Caleb starve, and so many fat rectors and
squires among us. I gave him a dinner once a week; but, Lord love you,
whatâ€™s once a week, when a man does not know where to go the other six
days? Well, but I must show the manuscript to little Tom Alibi the
solicitor, who manages all my law affairs--must keep on the windy side;
the mob were very uncivil the last time I mounted in Old Palace Yard--all
Whigs and Roundheads every man of them, Williamites and Hanover rats.â€™

The next day Mr. Pembroke again called on the publisher, but found Tom
Alibiâ€™s advice had determined him against undertaking the work. â€˜Not but
what I would go to--(what was I going to say?) to the Plantations for the
church with pleasure--but, dear Doctor, I have a wife and family; but, to
show my zeal, Iâ€™ll recommend the job to my neighbour Trimmel--he is a
bachelor, and leaving off business, so a voyage in a western barge would
not inconvenience him.â€™ But Mr. Trimmel was also obdurate, and Mr.
Pembroke, fortunately perchance for himself, was compelled to return to
Waverley-Honour with his treatise in vindication of the real fundamental
principles of church and state safely packed in his saddle-bags.

As the public were thus likely to be deprived of the benefit arising from
his lucubrations by the selfish cowardice of the trade, Mr. Pembroke
resolved to make two copies of these tremendous manuscripts for the use
of his pupil. He felt that he had been indolent as a tutor, and, besides,
his conscience checked him for complying with the request of Mr. Richard
Waverley, that he would impress no sentiments upon Edwardâ€™s mind
inconsistent with the present settlement in church and state. But now,
thought he, I may, without breach of my word, since he is no longer under
my tuition, afford the youth the means of judging for himself, and have
only to dread his reproaches for so long concealing the light which the
perusal will flash upon his mind. While he thus indulged the reveries of
an author and a politician, his darling proselyte, seeing nothing very
inviting in the title of the tracts, and appalled by the bulk and compact
lines of the manuscript, quietly consigned them to a corner of his
travelling trunk.

Aunt Rachelâ€™s farewell was brief and affectionate. She only cautioned her
dear Edward, whom she probably deemed somewhat susceptible, against the
fascination of Scottish beauty. She allowed that the northern part of the
island contained some ancient families, but they were all Whigs and
Presbyterians except the Highlanders; and respecting them she must needs
say, there could be no great delicacy among the ladies, where the
gentlemenâ€™s usual attire was, as she had been assured, to say the least,
very singular, and not at all decorous. She concluded her farewell with a
kind and moving benediction, and gave the young officer, as a pledge of
her regard, a valuable diamond ring (often worn by the male sex at that
time), and a purse of broad gold-pieces, which also were more common
Sixty Years Since than they have been of late.




CHAPTER VII

A HORSE-QUARTER IN SCOTLAND


The next morning, amid varied feelings, the chief of which was a
predominant, anxious, and even solemn impression, that he was now in a
great measure abandoned to his own guidance and direction, Edward
Waverley departed from the Hall amid the blessings and tears of all the
old domestics and the inhabitants of the village, mingled with some sly
petitions for sergeantcies and corporalships, and so forth, on the part
of those who professed that â€˜they never thoft to haâ€™ seen Jacob, and
Giles, and Jonathan go off for soldiers, save to attend his honour, as in
duty bound.â€™ Edward, as in duty bound, extricated himself from the
supplicants with the pledge of fewer promises than might have been
expected from a young man so little accustomed to the world. After a
short visit to London, he proceeded on horseback, then the general mode
of travelling, to Edinburgh, and from thence to Dundee, a seaport on the
eastern coast of Angus-shire, where his regiment was then quartered.

He now entered upon a new world, where, for a time, all was beautiful
because all was new. Colonel Gardiner, the commanding officer of the
regiment, was himself a study for a romantic, and at the same time an
inquisitive youth. In person he was tall, handsome, and active, though
somewhat advanced in life. In his early years he had been what is called,
by manner of palliative, a very gay young man, and strange stories were
circulated about his sudden conversion from doubt, if not infidelity, to
a serious and even enthusiastic turn of mind. It was whispered that a
supernatural communication, of a nature obvious even to the exterior
senses, had produced this wonderful change; and though some mentioned the
proselyte as an enthusiast, none hinted at his being a hypocrite. This
singular and mystical circumstance gave Colonel Gardiner a peculiar and
solemn interest in the eyes of the young soldier. [Footnote: See Note 5.]
It may be easily imagined that the officers, of a regiment commanded by
so respectable a person composed a society more sedate and orderly than a
military mess always exhibits; and that Waverley escaped some temptations
to which he might otherwise have been exposed.

Meanwhile his military education proceeded. Already a good horseman, he
was now initiated into the arts of the manege, which, when carried to
perfection, almost realise the fable of the Centaur, the guidance of the
horse appearing to proceed from the riderâ€™s mere volition, rather than
from the use of any external and apparent signal of motion. He received
also instructions in his field duty; but I must own, that when his first
ardour was past, his progress fell short in the latter particular of what
he wished and expected. The duty of an officer, the most imposing of all
others to the inexperienced mind, because accompanied with so much
outward pomp and circumstance, is in its essence a very dry and abstract
task, depending chiefly upon arithmetical combinations, requiring much
attention, and a cool and reasoning head to bring them into action. Our
hero was liable to fits of absence, in which his blunders excited some
mirth, and called down some reproof. This circumstance impressed him with
a painful sense of inferiority in those qualities which appeared most to
deserve and obtain regard in his new profession. He asked himself in
vain, why his eye could not judge of distance or space so well as those
of his companions; why his head was not always successful in
disentangling the various partial movements necessary to execute a
particular evolution; and why his memory, so alert upon most occasions,
did not correctly retain technical phrases and minute points of etiquette
or field discipline. Waverley was naturally modest, and therefore did not
fall into the egregious mistake of supposing such minuter rules of
military duty beneath his notice, or conceiting himself to be born a
general, because he made an indifferent subaltern. The truth was, that
the vague and unsatisfactory course of reading which he had pursued,
working upon a temper naturally retired and abstracted, had given him
that wavering and unsettled habit of mind which is most averse to study
and riveted attention. Time, in the mean while, hung heavy on his hands.
The gentry of the neighbourhood were disaffected, and showed little
hospitality to the military guests; and the people of the town, chiefly
engaged in mercantile pursuits, were not such as Waverley chose to
associate with. The arrival of summer, and a curiosity to know something
more of Scotland than he could see in a ride from his quarters,
determined him to request leave of absence for a few weeks. He resolved
first to visit his uncleâ€™s ancient friend and correspondent, with the
purpose of extending or shortening the time of his residence according to
circumstances. He travelled of course on horse-back, and with a single
attendant, and passed his first night at a miserable inn, where the
landlady had neither shoes nor stockings, and the landlord, who called
himself a gentleman, was disposed to be rude to his guest, because he had
not bespoke the pleasure of his society to supper. [Footnote: See Note
6.] The next day, traversing an open and uninclosed country, Edward
gradually approached the Highlands of Perthshire, which at first had
appeared a blue outline in the horizon, but now swelled into huge
gigantic masses, which frowned defiance over the more level country that
lay beneath them. Near the bottom of this stupendous barrier, but still
in the Lowland country, dwelt Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine;
and, if grey-haired eld can be in aught believed, there had dwelt his
ancestors, with all their heritage, since the days of the gracious King
Duncan.




CHAPTER VIII

A SCOTTISH MANOR-HOUSE SIXTY YEARS SINCE


It was about noon when Captain Waverley entered the straggling village,
or rather hamlet, of Tully-Veolan, close to which was situated the
mansion of the proprietor. The houses seemed miserable in the extreme,
especially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of English
cottages. They stood, without any respect for regularity, on each side of
a straggling kind of unpaved street, where children, almost in a
primitive state of nakedness, lay sprawling, as if to be crushed by the
hoofs of the first passing horse. Occasionally, indeed, when such a
consummation seemed inevitable, a watchful old grandam, with her close
cap, distaff, and spindle, rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of
these miserable cells, dashed into the middle of the path, and snatching
up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers, saluted him with a
sound cuff, and transported him back to his dungeon, the little
white-headed varlet screaming all the while, from the very top of his
lungs, a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the enraged
matron. Another part in this concert was sustained by the incessant
yelping of a score of idle useless curs, which followed, snarling,
barking, howling, and snapping at the horsesâ€™ heels; a nuisance at that
time so common in Scotland, that a French tourist, who, like other
travellers, longed to find a good and rational reason for everything he
saw, has recorded, as one of the memorabilia of Caledonia, that the state
maintained, in each village a relay of curs, called collies, whose duty
it was to chase the chevaux de poste (too starved and exhausted to move
without such a stimulus) from one hamlet to another, till their annoying
convoy drove them to the end of their stage. The evil and remedy (such as
it is) still exist.--But this is remote from our present purpose, and is
only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under Mr. Dentâ€™s Dog
Bill.

As Waverley moved on, here and there an old man, bent as much by toil as
years, his eyes bleared with age and smoke, tottered to the door of his
hut, to gaze on the dress of the stranger and the form and motions of the
horses, and then assembled, with his neighbours, in a little group at the
smithy, to discuss the probabilities of whence the stranger came and
where he might be going. Three or four village girls, returning from the
well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their heads, formed more
pleasing objects, and, with their thin short-gowns and single petticoats,
bare arms, legs, and feet, uncovered heads and braided hair, somewhat
resembled Italian forms of landscape. Nor could a lover of the
picturesque have challenged either the elegance of their costume or the
symmetry of their shape; although, to say the truth, a mere Englishman in
search of the COMFORTABLE, a word peculiar to his native tongue, might
have wished the clothes less scanty, the feet and legs somewhat protected
from the weather, the head and complexion shrouded from the sun, or
perhaps might even have thought the whole person and dress considerably
improved by a plentiful application of spring water, with a quantum
sufficit of soap. The whole scene was depressing; for it argued, at the
first glance, at least a stagnation of industry, and perhaps of
intellect. Even curiosity, the busiest passion of the idle, seemed of a
listless cast in the village of Tully-Veolan: the curs aforesaid alone
showed any part of its activity; with the villagers it was passive. They
stood, and gazed at the handsome young officer and his attendant, but
without any of those quick motions and eager looks that indicate the
earnestness with which those who live in monotonous ease at home look out
for amusement abroad. Yet the physiognomy of the people, when more
closely examined, was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity;
their features were rough, but remarkably intelligent; grave, but the
very reverse of stupid; and from among the young women an artist might
have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those
of Minerva. The children also, whose skins were burnt black, and whose
hair was bleached white, by the influence of the sun, had a look and
manner of life and interest. It seemed, upon the whole, as if poverty,
and indolence, its too frequent companion, were combining to depress the
natural genius and acquired information of a hardy, intelligent, and
reflecting peasantry.

Some such thoughts crossed Waverleyâ€™s mind as he paced his horse slowly
through the rugged and flinty street of Tully-Veolan, interrupted only in
his meditations by the occasional caprioles which his charger exhibited
at the reiterated assaults of those canine Cossacks, the collies before
mentioned. The village was more than half a mile long, the cottages being
irregularly divided from each other by gardens, or yards, as the
inhabitants called them, of different sizes, where (for it is Sixty Years
Since) the now universal potato was unknown, but which were stored with
gigantic plants of kale or colewort, encircled with groves of nettles,
and exhibited here and there a huge hemlock, or the national thistle,
overshadowing a quarter of the petty inclosure. The broken ground on
which the village was built had never been levelled; so that these
inclosures presented declivities of every degree, here rising like
terraces, there sinking like tan-pits. The dry-stone walls which fenced,
or seemed to fence (for they were sorely breached), these hanging gardens
of Tully-Veolan were intersected by a narrow lane leading to the common
field, where the joint labour of the villagers cultivated alternate
ridges and patches of rye, oats, barley, and pease, each of such minute
extent that at a little distance the unprofitable variety of the surface
resembled a tailorâ€™s book of patterns. In a few favoured instances, there
appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam, compiled of earth, loose
stones, and turf, where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow
or sorely galled horse. But almost every hut was fenced in front by a
huge black stack of turf on one side of the door, while on the other the
family dunghill ascended in noble emulation.





About a bowshot from the end of the village appeared the inclosures
proudly denominated the Parks of Tully-Veolan, being certain square
fields, surrounded and divided by stone walls five feet in height. In the
centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue, opening
under an archway, battlemented on the top, and adorned with two large
weather-beaten mutilated masses of upright stone, which, if the tradition
of the hamlet could be trusted, had once represented, at least had been
once designed to represent, two rampant Bears, the supporters of the
family of Bradwardine. This avenue was straight and of moderate length,
running between a double row of very ancient horse-chestnuts, planted
alternately with sycamores, which rose to such huge height, and nourished
so luxuriantly, that their boughs completely over-arched the broad road
beneath. Beyond these venerable ranks, and running parallel to them, were
two high walls, of apparently the like antiquity, overgrown with ivy,
honeysuckle, and other climbing plants. The avenue seemed very little
trodden, and chiefly by foot-passengers; so that being very broad, and
enjoying a constant shade, it was clothed with grass of a deep and rich
verdure, excepting where a foot-path, worn by occasional passengers,
tracked with a natural sweep the way from the upper to the lower gate.
This nether portal, like the former, opened in front of a wall ornamented
with some rude sculpture, with battlements on the top, over which were
seen, half-hidden by the trees of the avenue, the high steep roofs and
narrow gables of the mansion, with lines indented into steps, and corners
decorated with small turrets. One of the folding leaves of the lower gate
was open, and as the sun shone full into the court behind, a long line of
brilliancy was flung upon the aperture up the dark and gloomy avenue. It
was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent, and mingled
well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of
the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley.

The solitude and repose of the whole scene seemed almost monastic; and
Waverley, who had given his horse to his servant on entering the first
gate, walked slowly down the avenue, enjoying the grateful and cooling
shade, and so much pleased with the placid ideas of rest and seclusion
excited by this confined and quiet scene, that he forgot the misery and
dirt of the hamlet he had left behind him. The opening into the paved
court-yard corresponded with the rest of the scene. The house, which
seemed to consist of two or three high, narrow, and steep-roofed
buildings, projecting from each other at right angles, formed one side of
the inclosure. It had been built at a period when castles were no longer
necessary, and when the Scottish architects had not yet acquired the art
of designing a domestic residence. The windows were numberless, but very
small; the roof had some nondescript kind of projections, called
bartizans, and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret, rather
resembling a pepper-box than a Gothic watchtower. Neither did the front
indicate absolute security from danger. There were loop-holes for
musketry, and iron stanchions on the lower windows, probably to repel any
roving band of gypsies, or resist a predatory visit from the caterans of
the neighbouring Highlands. Stables and other offices occupied another
side of the square. The former were low vaults, with narrow slits instead
of windows, resembling, as Edwardâ€™s groom observed, â€˜rather a prison for
murderers, and larceners, and such like as are tried at â€˜sizes, than a
place for any Christian cattle.â€™ Above these dungeon-looking stables were
granaries, called girnels, and other offices, to which there was access
by outside stairs of heavy masonry. Two battlemented walls, one of which
faced the avenue, and the other divided the court from the garden,
completed the inclosure.

Nor was the court without its ornaments. In one corner was a tun-bellied
pigeon-house, of great size and rotundity, resembling in figure and
proportion the curious edifice called Arthurâ€™s Oven, which would have
turned the brains of all the antiquaries in England, had not the worthy
proprietor pulled it down for the sake of mending a neighbouring
dam-dyke. This dove-cot, or columbarium, as the owner called it, was no
small resource to a Scottish laird of that period, whose scanty rents
were eked out by the contributions levied upon the farms by these light
foragers, and the conscriptions exacted from the latter for the benefit
of the table.

Another corner of the court displayed a fountain, where a huge bear,
carved in stone, predominated over a large stone-basin, into which he
disgorged the water. This work of art was the wonder of the country ten
miles round. It must not be forgotten, that all sorts of bears, small and
large, demi or in full proportion, were carved over the windows, upon the
ends of the gables, terminated the spouts, and supported the turrets,
with the ancient family motto, â€˜Beware the Bearâ€™, cut under each
hyperborean form. The court was spacious, well paved, and perfectly
clean, there being probably another entrance behind the stables for
removing the litter. Everything around appeared solitary, and would have
been silent, but for the continued plashing of the fountain; and the
whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of
Waverley had conjured up. And here we beg permission to close a chapter
of still life. [Footnote: See Note 7.]




CHAPTER IX

MORE OF THE MANOR-HOUSE AND ITS ENVIRONS


After having satisfied his curiosity by gazing around him for a few
minutes, Waverley applied himself to the massive knocker of the
hall-door, the architrave of which bore the date 1594. But no answer was
returned, though the peal resounded through a number of apartments, and
was echoed from the court-yard walls without the house, startling the
pigeons from the venerable rotunda which they occupied, and alarming anew
even the distant village curs, which had retired to sleep upon their
respective dunghills. Tired of the din which he created, and the
unprofitable responses which it excited, Waverley began to think that he
had reached the castle of Orgoglio as entered by the victorious Prince
Arthur,--

When â€˜gan he loudly through the house to call,
But no man cared to answer to his cry;
There reignâ€™d a solemn silence over all,
Nor voice was heard, nor wight was seen in bower or hall.

Filled almost with expectation of beholding some â€˜old, old man, with
beard as white as snow,â€™ whom he might question concerning this deserted
mansion, our hero turned to a little oaken wicket-door, well clenched
with iron-nails, which opened in the court-yard wall at its angle with
the house. It was only latched, notwithstanding its fortified appearance,
and, when opened, admitted him into the garden, which presented a
pleasant scene. [Footnote: Footnote: At Ravelston may be seen such a
garden, which the taste of the proprietor, the authorâ€™s friend and
kinsman, Sir Alexander Keith, Knight Mareschal, has judiciously
preserved. That, as well as the house is, however, of smaller dimensions
than the Baron of Bradwardineâ€™s mansion and garden are presumed to have
been.] The southern side of the house, clothed with fruit-trees, and
having many evergreens trained upon its walls, extended its irregular yet
venerable front along a terrace, partly paved, partly gravelled, partly
bordered with flowers and choice shrubs. This elevation descended by
three several flights of steps, placed in its centre and at the
extremities, into what might be called the garden proper, and was fenced
along the top by a stone parapet with a heavy balustrade, ornamented from
space to space with huge grotesque figures of animals seated upon their
haunches, among which the favourite bear was repeatedly introduced.
Placed in the middle of the terrace between a sashed-door opening from
the house and the central flight of steps, a huge animal of the same
species supported on his head and fore-paws a sun-dial of large
circumference, inscribed with more diagrams than Edwardâ€™s mathematics
enabled him to decipher.

The garden, which seemed to be kept with great accuracy, abounded in
fruit-trees, and exhibited a profusion of flowers and evergreens, cut
into grotesque forms. It was laid out in terraces, which descended rank
by rank from the western wall to a large brook, which had a tranquil and
smooth appearance, where it served as a boundary to the garden; but, near
the extremity, leapt in tumult over a strong dam, or wear-head, the cause
of its temporary tranquillity, and there forming a cascade, was
overlooked by an octangular summer-house, with a gilded bear on the top
by way of vane. After this feat, the brook, assuming its natural rapid
and fierce character, escaped from the eye down a deep and wooded dell,
from the copse of which arose a massive, but ruinous tower, the former
habitation of the Barons of Bradwardine. The margin of the brook,
opposite to the garden, displayed a narrow meadow, or haugh, as it was
called, which formed a small washing-green; the bank, which retired
behind it, was covered by ancient trees.

The scene, though pleasing, was not quite equal to the gardens of Alcina;
yet wanted not the â€˜due donzellette garruleâ€™ of that enchanted paradise,
for upon the green aforesaid two bare-legged damsels, each standing in a
spacious tub, performed with their feet the office of a patent
washing-machine. These did not, however, like the maidens of Armida,
remain to greet with their harmony the approaching guest, but, alarmed at
the appearance of a handsome stranger on the opposite side, dropped their
garments (I should say garment, to be quite correct) over their limbs,
which their occupation exposed somewhat too freely, and, with a shrill
exclamation of â€˜Eh, sirs!â€™ uttered with an accent between modesty and
coquetry, sprung off like deer in different directions.





Waverley began to despair of gaining entrance into this solitary and
seemingly enchanted mansion, when a man advanced up one of the garden
alleys, where he still retained his station. Trusting this might be a
gardener, or some domestic belonging to the house, Edward descended the
steps in order to meet him; but as the figure approached, and long before
he could descry its features, he was struck with the oddity of its
appearance and gestures. Sometimes this mister wight held his hands
clasped over his head, like an Indian Jogue in the attitude of penance;
sometimes he swung them perpendicularly, like a pendulum, on each side;
and anon he slapped them swiftly and repeatedly across his breast, like
the substitute used by a hackney-coachman for his usual flogging
exercise, when his cattle are idle upon the stand, in a clear frosty day.
His gait was as singular as his gestures, for at times he hopped with
great perseverance on the right foot, then exchanged that supporter to
advance in the same manner on the left, and then putting his feet close
together he hopped upon both at once. His attire also was antiquated and
extravagant. It consisted in a sort of grey jerkin, with scarlet cuffs
and slashed sleeves, showing a scarlet lining; the other parts of the
dress corresponded in colour, not forgetting a pair of scarlet stockings,
and a scarlet bonnet, proudly surmounted with a turkeyâ€™s feather. Edward,
whom he did not seem to observe, now perceived confirmation in his
features of what the mien and gestures had already announced. It was
apparently neither idiocy nor insanity which gave that wild, unsettled,
irregular expression to a face which naturally was rather handsome, but
something that resembled a compound of both, where the simplicity of the
fool was mixed with the extravagance of a crazed imagination. He sung
with great earnestness, and not without some taste, a fragment of an old
Scottish ditty:--

    False love, and hast thou playâ€™d me this
    In summer among the flowers?
    I will repay thee back again
    In winter among the showers.
    Unless again, again, my love,
    Unless you turn again;
    As you with other maidens rove,
    Iâ€™ll smile on other men.

[Footnote: This is a genuine ancient fragment, with some alteration in
the two last lines.]

Here lifting up his eyes, which had hitherto been fixed in observing how
his feet kept time to the tune, he beheld Waverley, and instantly doffed
his cap, with many grotesque signals of surprise, respect, and
salutation. Edward, though with little hope of receiving an answer to any
constant question, requested to know whether Mr. Bradwardine were at
home, or where he could find any of the domestics. The questioned party
replied, and, like the witch of Thalaba, â€˜still his speech was song,â€™--

    The Knightâ€™s to the mountain
    His bugle to wind;
    The Ladyâ€™s to greenwood
    Her garland to bind.
    The bower of Burd Ellen
    Has moss on the floor,
    That the step of Lord William
    Be silent and sure.

This conveyed no information, and Edward, repeating his queries, received
a rapid answer, in which, from the haste and peculiarity of the dialect,
the word â€˜butlerâ€™ was alone intelligible. Waverley then requested to see
the butler; upon which the fellow, with a knowing look and nod of
intelligence, made a signal to Edward to follow, and began to dance and
caper down the alley up which he had made his approaches. A strange guide
this, thought Edward, and not much unlike one of Shakespeareâ€™s roynish
clowns. I am not over prudent to trust to his pilotage; but wiser men
have been led by fools. By this time he reached the bottom of the alley,
where, turning short on a little parterre of flowers, shrouded from the
east and north by a close yew hedge, he found an old man at work without
his coat, whose appearance hovered between that of an upper servant and
gardener; his red nose and ruffled shirt belonging to the former
profession; his hale and sunburnt visage, with his green apron, appearing
to indicate

Old Adamâ€™s likeness, set to dress this garden.

The major domo, for such he was, and indisputably the second officer of
state in the barony (nay, as chief minister of the interior, superior
even to Bailie Macwheeble in his own department of the kitchen and
cellar)--the major domo laid down his spade, slipped on his coat in
haste, and with a wrathful look at Edwardâ€™s guide, probably excited by
his having introduced a stranger while he was engaged in this laborious,
and, as he might suppose it, degrading office, requested to know the
gentlemanâ€™s commands. Being informed that he wished to pay his respects
to his master, that his name was Waverley, and so forth, the old manâ€™s
countenance assumed a great deal of respectful importance. â€˜He could take
it upon his conscience to say, his honour would have exceeding pleasure
in seeing him. Would not Mr. Waverley choose some refreshment after his
journey? His honour was with the folk who were getting doon the dark hag;
the twa gardener lads (an emphasis on the word twa) had been ordered to
attend him; and he had been just amusing himself in the mean time with
dressing Miss Roseâ€™s flower-bed, that he might be near to receive his
honourâ€™s orders, if need were; he was very fond of a garden, but had
little time for such divertisements.â€™

â€˜He canna get it wrought in abune twa days in the week at no rate
whatever,â€™ said Edwardâ€™s fantastic conductor.

A grim look from the butler chastised his interference, and he commanded
him, by the name of Davie Gellatley, in a tone which admitted no
discussion, to look for his honour at the dark hag, and tell him there
was a gentleman from the south had arrived at the Haâ€™.

â€˜Can this poor fellow deliver a letter?â€™ asked Edward.

â€˜With all fidelity, sir, to any one whom he respects. I would hardly
trust him with a long message by word of mouth--though he is more knave
than fool.â€™

Waverley delivered his credentials to Mr. Gellatley, who seemed to
confirm the butlerâ€™s last observation, by twisting his features at him,
when he was looking another way, into the resemblance of the grotesque
face on the bole of a German tobacco pipe; after which, with an odd conge
to Waverley, he danced off to discharge his errand.

â€˜He is an innocent, sir,â€™ said the butler; â€˜there is one such in almost
every town in the country, but ours is brought far ben. [Footnote: See
Note 8.] He used to work a dayâ€™s turn weel enough; but he helped Miss
Rose when she was flemit with the Laird of Killancureitâ€™s new English
bull, and since that time we caâ€™ him Davie Do-little; indeed we might caâ€™
him Davie Do-naething, for since he got that gay clothing, to please his
honour and my young mistress (great folks will have their fancies), he
has done naething but dance up and down about the toun, without doing a
single turn, unless trimming the lairdâ€™s fishing-wand or busking his
flies, or may be catching a dish of trouts at an orra time. But here
comes Miss Rose, who, I take burden upon me for her, will be especial
glad to see one of the house of Waverley at her fatherâ€™s mansion of
Tully-Veolan.â€™

But Rose Bradwardine deserves better of her unworthy historian than to be
introduced at the end of a chapter.

In the mean while it may be noticed, that Waverley learned two things
from this colloquy: that in Scotland a single house was called a TOWN,
and a natural fool an INNOCENT.




CHAPTER X

ROSE BRADWARDINE AND HER FATHER


Miss Bradwardine was but seventeen; yet, at the last races of the county
town of----, upon her health being proposed among a round of beauties,
the Laird of Bumperquaigh, permanent toast-master and croupier of the
Bautherwhillery Club, not only said MORE to the pledge in a pint bumper
of Bourdeaux, but, ere pouring forth the libation, denominated the
divinity to whom it was dedicated, â€˜the Rose of Tully-Veolanâ€™; upon which
festive occasion three cheers were given by all the sitting members of
that respectable society, whose throats the wine had left capable of such
exertion. Nay, I am well assured, that the sleeping partners of the
company snorted applause, and that although strong bumpers and weak
brains had consigned two or three to the floor, yet even these, fallen as
they were from their high estate, and weltering--I will carry the parody
no farther--uttered divers inarticulate sounds, intimating their assent
to the motion.

Such unanimous applause could not be extorted but by acknowledged merit;
and Rose Bradwardine not only deserved it, but also the approbation of
much more rational persons than the Bautherwhillery Club could have
mustered, even before discussion of the first magnum. She was indeed a
very pretty girl of the Scotch cast of beauty, that is, with a profusion
of hair of paley gold, and a skin like the snow of her own mountains in
whiteness. Yet she had not a pallid or pensive cast of countenance; her
features, as well as her temper, had a lively expression; her complexion,
though not florid, was so pure as to seem transparent, and the slightest
emotion sent her whole blood at once to her face and neck. Her form,
though under the common size, was remarkably elegant, and her motions
light, easy, and unembarrassed. She came from another part of the garden
to receive Captain Waverley, with a manner that hovered between
bashfulness and courtesy.

The first greetings past, Edward learned from her that the dark hag,
which had somewhat puzzled him in the butlerâ€™s account of his masterâ€™s
avocations, had nothing to do either with a black cat or a broomstick,
but was simply a portion of oak copse which was to be felled that day.
She offered, with diffident civility, to show the stranger the way to the
spot, which, it seems, was not far distant; but they were prevented by
the appearance of the Baron of Bradwardine in person, who, summoned by
David Gellatley, now appeared, â€˜on hospitable thoughts intent,â€™ clearing
the ground at a prodigious rate with swift and long strides, which
reminded Waverley of the seven-league boots of the nursery fable. He was
a tall, thin, athletic figure, old indeed and grey-haired, but with every
muscle rendered as tough as whip-cord by constant exercise. He was
dressed carelessly, and more like a Frenchman than an Englishman of the
period, while, from his hard features and perpendicular rigidity of
stature, he bore some resemblance to a Swiss officer of the guards, who
had resided some time at Paris, and caught the costume, but not the ease
or manner, of its inhabitants. The truth was, that his language and
habits were as heterogeneous as his external appearance.

Owing to his natural disposition to study, or perhaps to a very general
Scottish fashion of giving young men of rank a legal education, he had
been bred with a view to the bar. But the politics of his family
precluding the hope of his rising in that profession, Mr. Bradwardine
travelled with high reputation for several years, and made some campaigns
in foreign service. After his demele with the law of high treason in
1715, he had lived in retirement, conversing almost entirely with those
of his own principles in the vicinage. The pedantry of the lawyer,
superinduced upon the military pride of the soldier, might remind a
modern of the days of the zealous volunteer service, when the bar-gown of
our pleaders was often flung over a blazing uniform. To this must be
added the prejudices of ancient birth and Jacobite politics, greatly
strengthened by habits of solitary and secluded authority, which, though
exercised only within the bounds of his half-cultivated estate, was there
indisputable and undisputed. For, as he used to observe, â€˜the lands of
Bradwardine, Tully-Veolan, and others, had been erected into a free
barony by a charter from David the First, cum liberali potest. habendi
curias et justicias, cum fossa et furca (LIE, pit and gallows) et saka et
soka, et thol et theam, et infang-thief et outfang-thief, sive
hand-habend, sive bak-barand.â€™ The peculiar meaning of all these
cabalistical words few or none could explain; but they implied, upon the
whole, that the Baron of Bradwardine might, in case of delinquency,
imprison, try, and execute his vassals at his pleasure. Like James the
First, however, the present possessor of this authority was more pleased
in talking about prerogative than in exercising it; and excepting that he
imprisoned two poachers in the dungeon of the old tower of Tully-Veolan,
where they were sorely frightened by ghosts, and almost eaten by rats,
and that he set an old woman in the jougs (or Scottish pillory) for
sayingâ€™ there were mair fules in the lairdâ€™s haâ€™ house than Davie
Gellatley,â€™ I do not learn that he was accused of abusing his high
powers. Still, however, the conscious pride of possessing them gave
additional importance to his language and deportment.

At his first address to Waverley, it would seem that the hearty pleasure
he felt to behold the nephew of his friend had somewhat discomposed the
stiff and upright dignity of the Baron of Bradwardineâ€™s demeanour, for
the tears stood in the old gentlemanâ€™s eyes, when, having first shaken
Edward heartily by the hand in the English fashion, he embraced him a la
mode Francoise, and kissed him on both sides of his face; while the
hardness of his gripe, and the quantity of Scotch snuff which his
accolade communicated, called corresponding drops of moisture to the eyes
of his guest.

â€˜Upon the honour of a gentleman,â€™ he said, â€˜but it makes me young again
to see you here, Mr. Waverley! A worthy scion of the old stock of
Waverley-Honour--spes altera, as Maro hath it--and you have the look of
the old line, Captain Waverley; not so portly yet as my old friend Sir
Everard--mais cela viendra avec le tems, as my Dutch acquaintance, Baron
Kikkitbroeck, said of the sagesse of Madame son epouse. And so ye have
mounted the cockade? Right, right; though I could have wished the colour
different, and so I would haâ€™ deemed might Sir Everard. But no more of
that; I am old, and times are changed. And how does the worthy knight
baronet, and the fair Mrs. Rachel?--Ah, ye laugh, young man! In troth she
was the fair Mrs. Rachel in the year of grace seventeen hundred and
sixteen; but time passes--et singula praedantur anni--that is most
certain. But once again ye are most heartily welcome to my poor house of
Tully-Veolan! Hie to the house, Rose, and see that Alexander Saunderson
looks out the old Chateau Margaux, which I sent from Bourdeaux to Dundee
in the year 1713.â€™

Rose tripped off demurely enough till she turned the first corner, and
then ran with the speed of a fairy, that she might gain leisure, after
discharging her fatherâ€™s commission, to put her own dress in order, and
produce all her little finery, an occupation for which the approaching
dinner-hour left but limited time.

â€˜We cannot rival the luxuries of your English table, Captain Waverley, or
give you the epulae lautiores of Waverley-Honour. I say epulae rather
than prandium, because the latter phrase is popular: epulae ad senatum,
prandium vero ad populum attinet, says Suetonius Tranquillus. But I trust
ye will applaud my Bourdeaux; câ€™est des deux oreilles, as Captain Vinsauf
used to say; vinum primae notae, the principal of Saint Andrews
denominated it. And, once more, Captain Waverley, right glad am I that ye
are here to drink the best my cellar can make forthcoming.â€™

This speech, with the necessary interjectional answers, continued from
the lower alley where they met up to the door of the house, where four or
five servants in old-fashioned liveries, headed by Alexander Saunderson,
the butler, who now bore no token of the sable stains of the garden,
received them in grand COSTUME,

In an old hall hung round with pikes and with bows,
With old bucklers and corslets that had borne many shrewd blows.

With much ceremony, and still more real kindness, the Baron, without
stopping in any intermediate apartment, conducted his guest through
several into the great dining parlour, wainscotted with black oak, and
hung round with the pictures of his ancestry, where a table was set forth
in form for six persons, and an old-fashioned beaufet displayed all the
ancient and massive plate of the Bradwardine family. A bell was now heard
at the head of the avenue; for an old man, who acted as porter upon gala
days, had caught the alarm given by Waverleyâ€™s arrival, and, repairing to
his post, announced the arrival of other guests.

These, as the Baron assured his young friend, were very estimable
persons. â€˜There was the young Laird of Balmawhapple, a Falconer by
surname, of the house of Glenfarquhar, given right much to
field-sports--gaudet equis et canibus--but a very discreet young
gentleman. Then there was the Laird of Killancureit, who had devoted his
leisure UNTILL tillage and agriculture, and boasted himself to be
possessed of a bull of matchless merit, brought from the county of Devon
(the Damnonia of the Romans, if we can trust Robert of Cirencester). He
is, as ye may well suppose from such a tendency, but of yeoman
extraction--servabit odorem testa diu--and I believe, between ourselves,
his grandsire was from the wrong side of the Border--one Bullsegg, who
came hither as a steward, or bailiff, or ground-officer, or something in
that department, to the last Girnigo of Killancureit, who died of an
atrophy. After his masterâ€™s death, sir,--ye would hardly believe such a
scandal,--but this Bullsegg, being portly and comely of aspect,
intermarried with the lady dowager, who was young and amorous, and
possessed himself of the estate, which devolved on this unhappy woman by
a settlement of her umwhile husband, in direct contravention of an
unrecorded taillie, and to the prejudice of the disponerâ€™s own flesh and
blood, in the person of his natural heir and seventh cousin, Girnigo of
Tipperhewit, whose family was so reduced by the ensuing law-suit, that
his representative is now serving as a private gentleman-sentinel in the
Highland Black Watch. But this gentleman, Mr. Bullsegg of Killancureit
that now is, has good blood in his veins by the mother and grandmother,
who were both of the family of Pickletillim, and he is well liked and
looked upon, and knows his own place. And God forbid, Captain Waverley,
that we of irreproachable lineage should exult over him, when it may be,
that in the eighth, ninth, or tenth generation, his progeny may rank, in
a manner, with the old gentry of the country. Rank and ancestry, sir,
should be the last words in the mouths of us of unblemished race--vix ea
nostra voco, as Naso saith. There is, besides, a clergyman of the true
(though suffering) Episcopal church of Scotland. [Footnote: See Note 9.]
He was a confessor in her cause after the year 1715, when a Whiggish mob
destroyed his meeting-house, tore his surplice, and plundered his
dwelling-house of four silver spoons, intromitting also with his mart and
his mealark, and with two barrels, one of single and one of double ale,
besides three bottles of brandy. My baron-bailie and doer, Mr. Duncan
Macwheeble, is the fourth on our list. There is a question, owing to the
incertitude of ancient orthography, whether he belongs to the clan of
Wheedle or of Quibble, but both have produced persons eminent in the
law.â€™--

As such he described them by person and name,
They enterâ€™d, and dinner was served as they came.




CHAPTER XI

THE BANQUET


The entertainment was ample and handsome, according to the Scotch ideas
of the period, and the guests did great honour to it. The Baron eat like
a famished soldier, the Laird of Balmawhapple like a sportsman, Bullsegg
of Killancureit like a farmer, Waverley himself like a traveller, and
Bailie Macwheeble like all four together; though, either out of more
respect, or in order to preserve that proper declination of person which
showed a sense that he was in the presence of his patron, he sat upon the
edge of his chair, placed at three feet distance from the table, and
achieved a communication with his plate by projecting his person towards
it in a line which obliqued from the bottom of his spine, so that the
person who sat opposite to him could only see the foretop of his riding
periwig.

This stooping position might have been inconvenient to another person;
but long habit made it, whether seated or walking, perfectly easy to the
worthy Bailie. In the latter posture it occasioned, no doubt, an unseemly
projection of the person towards those who happened to walk behind; but
those being at all times his inferiors (for Mr. Macwheeble was very
scrupulous in giving place to all others), he cared very little what
inference of contempt or slight regard they might derive from the
circumstance. Hence, when he waddled across the court to and from his old
grey pony, he somewhat resembled a turnspit walking upon its hind legs.

The nonjuring clergyman was a pensive and interesting old man, with much
of the air of a sufferer for conscienceâ€™ sake. He was one of those

     Who, undeprived, their benefice forsook.

For this whim, when the Baron was out of hearing, the Bailie used
sometimes gently to rally Mr. Rubrick, upbraiding him with the nicety of
his scruples. Indeed, it must be owned, that he himself, though at heart
a keen partisan of the exiled family, had kept pretty fair with all the
different turns of state in his time; so that Davie Gellatley once
described him as a particularly good man, who had a very quiet and
peaceful conscience, THAT NEVER DID HIM ANY HARM.

When the dinner was removed, the Baron announced the health of the King,
politely leaving to the consciences of his guests to drink to the
sovereign de facto or de jure, as their politics inclined. The
conversation now became general; and, shortly afterwards, Miss
Bradwardine, who had done the honours with natural grace and simplicity,
retired, and was soon followed by the clergyman. Among the rest of the
party, the wine, which fully justified the encomiums of the landlord,
flowed freely round, although Waverley, with some difficulty, obtained
the privilege of sometimes neglecting the glass. At length, as the
evening grew more late, the Baron made a private signal to Mr. Saunders
Saunderson, or, as he facetiously denominated him, Alexander ab
Alexandro, who left the room with a nod, and soon after returned, his
grave countenance mantling with a solemn and mysterious smile, and placed
before his master a small oaken casket, mounted with brass ornaments of
curious form. The Baron, drawing out a private key, unlocked the casket,
raised the lid, and produced a golden goblet of a singular and antique
appearance, moulded into the shape of a rampant bear, which the owner
regarded with a look of mingled reverence, pride, and delight, that
irresistibly reminded Waverley of Ben Jonsonâ€™s Tom Otter, with his Bull,
Horse, and Dog, as that wag wittily denominated his chief carousing cups.
But Mr. Bradwardine, turning towards him with complacency, requested him
to observe this curious relic of the olden time.

â€˜It represents,â€™ he said, â€˜the chosen crest of our family, a bear, as ye
observe, and RAMPANT; because a good herald will depict every animal in
its noblest posture, as a horse SALIENT, a greyhound CURRANT, and, as may
be inferred, a ravenous animal in actu ferociori, or in a voracious,
lacerating, and devouring posture. Now, sir, we hold this most honourable
achievement by the wappen-brief, or concession of arms, of Frederick
Red-beard, Emperor of Germany, to my predecessor, Godmund Bradwardine, it
being the crest of a gigantic Dane, whom he slew in the lists in the Holy
Land, on a quarrel touching the chastity of the emperorâ€™s spouse or
daughter, tradition saith not precisely which, and thus, as Virgilius
hath it--

Mutemus clypeos,
Danaumque insignia nobis
Aptemus.

Then for the cup, Captain Waverley, it was wrought by the command of
Saint Duthac, Abbot of Aberbrothock, for behoof of another baron of the
house of Bradwardine, who had valiantly defended the patrimony of that
monastery against certain encroaching nobles. It is properly termed the
Blessed Bear of Bradwardine (though old Doctor Doubleit used jocosely to
call it Ursa Major), and was supposed, in old and Catholic times, to be
invested with certain properties of a mystical and supernatural quality.
And though I give not in to such anilia, it is certain it has always been
esteemed a solemn standard cup and heirloom of our house; nor is it ever
used but upon seasons of high festival, and such I hold to be the arrival
of the heir of Sir Everard under my roof; and I devote this draught to
the health and prosperity of the ancient and highly-to-be-honoured house
of Waverley.â€™

During this long harangue, he carefully decanted a cob-webbed bottle of
claret into the goblet, which held nearly an English pint; and, at the
conclusion, delivering the bottle to the butler, to be held carefully in
the same angle with the horizon, he devoutly quaffed off the contents of
the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine.

Edward, with horror and alarm, beheld the animal making his rounds, and
thought with great anxiety upon the appropriate motto, â€˜Beware the Bearâ€™;
but, at the same time, plainly foresaw that, as none of the guests
scrupled to do him this extraordinary honour, a refusal on his part to
pledge their courtesy would be extremely ill received. Resolving,
therefore, to submit to this last piece of tyranny, and then to quit the
table, if possible, and confiding in the strength of his constitution, he
did justice to the company in the contents of the Blessed Bear, and felt
less inconvenience from the draught than he could possibly have expected.
The others, whose time had been more actively employed, began to show
symptoms of innovation--â€˜the good wine did its good office.â€™ [Footnote:
Southeyâ€™s Madoc.] The frost of etiquette and pride of birth began to give
way before the genial blessings of this benign constellation, and the
formal appellatives with which the three dignitaries had hitherto
addressed each other were now familiarly abbreviated into Tully, Bally,
and Killie. When a few rounds had passed, the two latter, after
whispering together, craved permission (a joyful hearing for Edward) to
ask the grace-cup. This, after some delay, was at length produced, and
Waverley concluded the orgies of Bacchus were terminated for the evening.
He was never more mistaken in his life.

As the guests had left their horses at the small inn, or change-house, as
it was called, of the village, the Baron could not, in politeness, avoid
walking with them up the avenue, and Waverley from the same motive, and
to enjoy after this feverish revel the cool summer evening, attended the
party. But when they arrived at Luckie Maclearyâ€™s the Lairds of
Balmawhapple and Killancureit declared their determination to acknowledge
their sense of the hospitality of Tully-Veolan by partaking, with their
entertainer and his guest Captain Waverley, what they technically called
deoch an doruis, a stirrup-cup, [Footnote 2: See Note 10] to the honour
of the Baronâ€™s roof-tree.

It must be noticed that the Bailie, knowing by experience that the dayâ€™s
jovialty, which had been hitherto sustained at the expense of his patron,
might terminate partly at his own, had mounted his spavined grey pony,
and, between gaiety of heart and alarm for being hooked into a reckoning,
spurred him into a hobbling canter (a trot was out of the question), and
had already cleared the village. The others entered the change-house,
leading Edward in unresisting submission; for his landlord whispered him,
that to demur to such an overture would be construed into a high
misdemeanour against the leges conviviales, or regulations of genial
compotation. Widow Macleary seemed to have expected this visit, as well
she might, for it was the usual consummation of merry bouts, not only at
Tully-Veolan, but at most other gentlemenâ€™s houses in Scotland, Sixty
Years Since. The guests thereby at once acquitted themselves of their
burden of gratitude for their entertainerâ€™s kindness, encouraged the
trade of his change-house, did honour to the place which afforded harbour
to their horses, and indemnified themselves for the previous restraints
imposed by private hospitality, by spending what Falstaff calls the sweet
of the night in the genial license of a tavern.

Accordingly, in full expectation of these distinguished guests, Luckie
Macleary had swept her house for the first time this fortnight, tempered
her turf-fire to such a heat as the season required in her damp hovel
even at Midsummer, set forth her deal table newly washed, propped its
lame foot with a fragment of turf, arranged four or five stools of huge
and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the inequalities of her
clay floor; and having, moreover, put on her clean toy, rokelay, and
scarlet plaid, gravely awaited the arrival of the company, in full hope
of custom and profit. When they were seated under the sooty rafters of
Luckie Maclearyâ€™s only apartment, thickly tapestried with cobwebs, their
hostess, who had already taken her cue from the Laird of Balmawhapple,
appeared with a huge pewter measuring-pot, containing at least three
English quarts, familiarly denominated a Tappit Hen, and which, in the
language of the hostess, reamed (i.e., mantled) with excellent claret
just drawn from the cask.

It was soon plain that what crumbs of reason the Bear had not devoured
were to be picked up by the Hen; but the confusion which appeared to
prevail favoured Edwardâ€™s resolution to evade the gaily circling glass.
The others began to talk thick and at once, each performing his own part
in the conversation without the least respect to his neighbour. The Baron
of Bradwardine sung French chansons-a-boire, and spouted pieces of Latin;
Killancureit talked, in a steady unalterable dull key, of top-dressing
and bottom-dressing, [Footnote: This has been censured as an anachronism;
and it must be confessed that agriculture of this kind was unknown to the
Scotch Sixty Years Since.] and year-olds, and gimmers, and dinmonts, and
stots, and runts, and kyloes, and a proposed turnpike-act; while
Balmawhapple, in notes exalted above both, extolled his horse, his hawks,
and a greyhound called Whistler. In the middle of this din, the Baron
repeatedly implored silence; and when at length the instinct of polite
discipline so far prevailed that for a moment he obtained it, he hastened
to beseech their attention â€˜unto a military ariette, which was a
particular favourite of the Marechal Duc de Berwickâ€™; then, imitating, as
well as he could, the manner and tone of a French musquetaire, he
immediately commenced,--

    Mon coeur volage, dit elle,
      Nâ€™est pas pour vous, garcon;
    Est pour un homme de guerre,
      Qui a barbe au menton.
                 Lon, Lon, Laridon.

    Qui port chapeau a plume,
      Soulier a rouge talon,
    Qui joue de la flute,
      Aussi du violon.
                 Lon, Lon, Laridon.

Balmawhapple could hold no longer, but broke in with what he called a
d--d good song, composed by Gibby Gaethroughwiâ€™t, the piper of Cupar;
and, without wasting more time, struck up,--

    Itâ€™s up Glenbarchanâ€™s braes I gaed,
    And oâ€™er the bent of Killiebraid,
    And mony a weary cast I made,
      To cuittle the moor-fowlâ€™s tail.

[Footnote: Suum cuique. This snatch of a ballad was composed by Andrew
MacDonald, the ingenious and unfortunate author of Vimonda.]

The Baron, whose voice was drowned in the louder and more obstreperous
strains of Balmawhapple, now dropped the competition, but continued to
hum â€˜Lon, Lon, Laridon,â€™ and to regard the successful candidate for the
attention of the company with an eye of disdain, while Balmawhapple
proceeded,--

    If up a bonny black-cock should spring,
    To whistle him down wiâ€™ a slug in his wing,
    And strap him on to my lunzie string,
    Right seldom would I fail.

After an ineffectual attempt to recover the second verse, he sung the
first over again; and, in prosecution of his triumph, declared there was
â€˜more sense in that than in all the derry-dongs of France, and Fifeshire
to the boot of it.â€™ The Baron only answered with a long pinch of snuff
and a glance of infinite contempt. But those noble allies, the Bear and
the Hen, had emancipated the young laird from the habitual reverence in
which he held Bradwardine at other times. He pronounced the claret
shilpit, and demanded brandy with great vociferation. It was brought; and
now the Demon of Politics envied even the harmony arising from this Dutch
concert, merely because there was not a wrathful note in the strange
compound of sounds which it produced. Inspired by her, the Laird of
Balmawhapple, now superior to the nods and winks with which the Baron of
Bradwardine, in delicacy to Edward, had hitherto checked his entering
upon political discussion, demanded a bumper, with the lungs of a
Stentor, â€˜to the little gentleman in black velvet who did such service in
1702, and may the white horse break his neck over a mound of his making!â€™

Edward was not at that moment clear-headed enough to remember that King
Williamâ€™s fall, which occasioned his death, was said to be owing to his
horse stumbling at a mole-hill; yet felt inclined to take umbrage at a
toast which seemed, from the glance of Balmawhappleâ€™s eye, to have a
peculiar and uncivil reference to the Government which he served. But,
ere he could interfere, the Baron of Bradwardine had taken up the
quarrel. â€˜Sir,â€™ he said, â€˜whatever my sentiments tanquam privatus may be
in such matters, I shall not tamely endure your saying anything that may
impinge upon the honourable feelings of a gentleman under my roof. Sir,
if you have no respect for the laws of urbanity, do ye not respect the
military oath, the sacramentum militare, by which every officer is bound
to the standards under which he is enrolled? Look at Titus Livius, what
he says of those Roman soldiers who were so unhappy as exuere
sacramentum, to renounce their legionary oath; but you are ignorant, sir,
alike of ancient history and modern courtesy.â€™

â€˜Not so ignorant as ye would pronounce me,â€™ roared Balmawhapple. â€˜I ken
weel that you mean the Solemn League and Covenant; but if aâ€™ the Whigs in
hell had taken the--â€™

Here the Baron and Waverley both spoke at once, the former calling out,
â€˜Be silent, sir! ye not only show your ignorance, but disgrace your
native country before a stranger and an Englishmanâ€™; and Waverley, at the
same moment, entreating Mr. Bradwardine to permit him to reply to an
affront which seemed levelled at him personally. But the Baron was
exalted by wine, wrath, and scorn above all sublunary considerations.

â€˜I crave you to be hushed, Captain Waverley; you are elsewhere,
peradventure, sui juris,--foris-familiated, that is, and entitled, it may
be, to think and resent for yourself; but in my domain, in this poor
Barony of Bradwardine, and under this roof, which is quasi mine, being
held by tacit relocation by a tenant at will, I am in loco parentis to
you, and bound to see you scathless. And for you, Mr. Falconer of
Balmawhapple, I warn ye, let me see no more aberrations from the paths of
good manners.â€™

â€˜And I tell you, Mr. Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine and
Tully-Veolan,â€™ retorted the sportsman in huge disdain, â€˜that Iâ€™ll make a
moor-cock of the man that refuses my toast, whether it be a crop-eared
English Whig wiâ€™ a black ribband at his lug, or ane wha deserts his ain
friends to claw favour wiâ€™ the rats of Hanover.â€™

In an instant both rapiers were brandished, and some desperate passes
exchanged. Balmawhapple was young, stout, and active; but the Baron,
infinitely more master of his weapon, would, like Sir Toby Belch, have
tickled his opponent other gates than he did had he not been under the
influence of Ursa Major.

Edward rushed forward to interfere between the combatants, but the
prostrate bulk of the Laird of Killancureit, over which he stumbled,
intercepted his passage. How Killancureit happened to be in this
recumbent posture at so interesting a moment was never accurately known.
Some thought he was about to insconce himself under the table; he himself
alleged that he stumbled in the act of lifting a joint-stool, to prevent
mischief, by knocking down Balmawhapple. Be that as it may, if readier
aid than either his or Waverleyâ€™s had not interposed, there would
certainly have been bloodshed. But the well-known clash of swords, which
was no stranger to her dwelling, aroused Luckie Macleary as she sat
quietly beyond the hallan, or earthen partition of the cottage, with eyes
employed on Bostonâ€™s â€˜Crook the Lot,â€™ while her ideas were engaged in
summing up the reckoning. She boldly rushed in, with the shrill
expostulation, â€˜Wad their honours slay ane another there, and bring
discredit on an honest widow-womanâ€™s house, when there was aâ€™ the
lee-land in the country to fight upon?â€™ a remonstrance which she seconded
by flinging her plaid with great dexterity over the weapons of the
combatants. The servants by this time rushed in, and being, by great
chance, tolerably sober, separated the incensed opponents, with the
assistance of Edward and Killancureit. The latter led off Balmawhapple,
cursing, swearing, and vowing revenge against every Whig, Presbyterian,
and fanatic in England and Scotland, from John-oâ€™-Groatâ€™s to the Landâ€™s
End, and with difficulty got him to horse. Our hero, with the assistance
of Saunders Saunderson, escorted the Baron of Bradwardine to his own
dwelling, but could not prevail upon him to retire to bed until he had
made a long and learned apology for the events of the evening, of which,
however, there was not a word intelligible, except something about the
Centaurs and the Lapithae.




CHAPTER XII

REPENTANCE AND A RECONCILIATION


Waverley was unaccustomed to the use of wine, excepting with great
temperance. He slept therefore soundly till late in the succeeding
morning, and then awakened to a painful recollection of the scene of the
preceding evening. He had received a personal affront--he, a gentleman, a
soldier, and a Waverley. True, the person who offered it was not, at the
time it was given, possessed of the moderate share of sense which nature
had allotted him; true also, in resenting this insult, he would break the
laws of Heaven as well as of his country; true, in doing so, he might
take the life of a young man who perhaps respectably discharged the
social duties, and render his family miserable, or he might lose his
own--no pleasant alternative even to the bravest, when it is debated
coolly and in private.

All this pressed on his mind; yet the original statement recurred with
the same irresistible force. He had received a personal insult; he was of
the house of Waverley; and he bore a commission. There was no
alternative; and he descended to the breakfast parlour with the intention
of taking leave of the family, and writing to one of his brother officers
to meet him at the inn midway between Tully-Veolan and the town where
they were quartered, in order that he might convey such a message to the
Laird of Balmawhapple as the circumstances seemed to demand. He found
Miss Bradwardine presiding over the tea and coffee, the table loaded with
warm bread, both of flour, oatmeal, and barleymeal, in the shape of
loaves, cakes, biscuits, and other varieties, together with eggs,
reindeer ham, mutton and beef ditto, smoked salmon, marmalade, and all
the other delicacies which induced even Johnson himself to extol the
luxury of a Scotch breakfast above that of all other countries. A mess of
oatmeal porridge, flanked by a silver jug, which held an equal mixture of
cream and butter-milk, was placed for the Baronâ€™s share of this repast;
but Rose observed, he had walked out early in the morning, after giving
orders that his guest should not be disturbed.

Waverley sat down almost in silence, and with an air of absence and
abstraction which could not give Miss Bradwardine a favourable opinion of
his talents for conversation. He answered at random one or two
observations which she ventured to make upon ordinary topics; so that,
feeling herself almost repulsed in her efforts at entertaining him, and
secretly wondering that a scarlet coat should cover no better breeding,
she left him to his mental amusement of cursing Doctor Doubleitâ€™s
favourite constellation of Ursa Major as the cause of all the mischief
which had already happened and was likely to ensue. At once he started,
and his colour heightened, as, looking toward the window, he beheld the
Baron and young Balmawhapple pass arm in arm, apparently in deep
conversation; and he hastily asked, â€˜Did Mr. Falconer sleep here last
night?â€™ Rose, not much pleased with the abruptness of the first question
which the young stranger had addressed to her, answered drily in the
negative, and the conversation again sunk into silence.

At this moment Mr. Saunderson appeared, with a message from his master,
requesting to speak with Captain Waverley in another apartment. With a
heart which beat a little quicker, not indeed from fear, but from
uncertainty and anxiety, Edward obeyed the summons. He found the two
gentlemen standing together, an air of complacent dignity on the brow of
the Baron, while something like sullenness or shame, or both, blanked the
bold visage of Balmawhapple. The former slipped his arm through that of
the latter, and thus seeming to walk with him, while in reality he led
him, advanced to meet Waverley, and, stopping in the midst of the
apartment, made in great state the following oration: â€˜Captain
Waverley--my young and esteemed friend, Mr. Falconer of Balmawhapple, has
craved of my age and experience, as of one not wholly unskilled in the
dependencies and punctilios of the duello or monomachia, to be his
interlocutor in expressing to you the regret with which he calls to
remembrance certain passages of our symposion last night, which could not
but be highly displeasing to you, as serving for the time under this
present existing government. He craves you, sir, to drown in oblivion the
memory of such solecisms against the laws of politeness, as being what
his better reason disavows, and to receive the hand which he offers you
in amity; and I must needs assure you that nothing less than a sense of
being dans son tort, as a gallant French chevalier, Mons. Le Bretailleur,
once said to me on such an occasion, and an opinion also of your peculiar
merit, could have extorted such concessions; for he and all his family
are, and have been, time out of mind, Mavortia pectora, as Buchanan
saith, a bold and warlike sept, or people.â€™

Edward immediately, and with natural politeness, accepted the hand which
Balmawhapple, or rather the Baron in his character of mediator, extended
towards him. â€˜It was impossible,â€™ he said, â€˜for him to remember what a
gentleman expressed his wish he had not uttered; and he willingly imputed
what had passed to the exuberant festivity of the day.â€™

â€˜That is very handsomely said,â€™ answered the Baron; â€˜for undoubtedly, if
a man be ebrius, or intoxicated, an incident which on solemn and festive
occasions may and will take place in the life of a man of honour; and if
the same gentleman, being fresh and sober, recants the contumelies which
he hath spoken in his liquor, it must be held vinum locutum est; the
words cease to be his own. Yet would I not find this exculpation relevant
in the case of one who was ebriosus, or an habitual drunkard; because, if
such a person choose to pass the greater part of his time in the
predicament of intoxication, he hath no title to be exeemed from the
obligations of the code of politeness, but should learn to deport himself
peaceably and courteously when under influence of the vinous stimulus.
And now let us proceed to breakfast, and think no more of this daft
business.â€™

I must confess, whatever inference may be drawn from the circumstance,
that Edward, after so satisfactory an explanation, did much greater
honour to the delicacies of Miss Bradwardineâ€™s breakfast-table than his
commencement had promised. Balmawhapple, on the contrary, seemed
embarrassed and dejected; and Waverley now, for the first time, observed
that his arm was in a sling, which seemed to account for the awkward and
embarrassed manner with which he had presented his hand. To a question
from Miss Bradwardine, he muttered in answer something about his horse
having fallen; and seeming desirous to escape both from the subject and
the company, he arose as soon as breakfast was over, made his bow to the
party, and, declining the Baronâ€™s invitation to tarry till after dinner,
mounted his horse and returned to his own home.

Waverley now announced his purpose of leaving Tully-Veolan early enough
after dinner to gain the stage at which he meant to sleep; but the
unaffected and deep mortification with which the good-natured and
affectionate old gentleman heard the proposal quite deprived him of
courage to persist in it. No sooner had he gained Waverleyâ€™s consent to
lengthen his visit for a few days than he laboured to remove the grounds
upon which he conceived he had meditated a more early retreat. â€˜I would
not have you opine, Captain Waverley, that I am by practice or precept an
advocate of ebriety, though it may be that, in our festivity of last
night, some of our friends, if not perchance altogether ebrii, or
drunken, were, to say the least, ebrioli, by which the ancients designed
those who were fuddled, or, as your English vernacular and metaphorical
phrase goes, half-seas-over. Not that I would so insinuate respecting
you, Captain Waverley, who, like a prudent youth, did rather abstain from
potation; nor can it be truly said of myself, who, having assisted at the
tables of many great generals and marechals at their solemn carousals,
have the art to carry my wine discreetly, and did not, during the whole
evening, as ye must have doubtless observed, exceed the bounds of a
modest hilarity.â€™

There was no refusing assent to a proposition so decidedly laid down by
him, who undoubtedly was the best judge; although, had Edward formed his
opinion from his own recollections, he would have pronounced that the
Baron was not only ebriolus, but verging to become ebrius; or, in plain
English, was incomparably the most drunk of the party, except perhaps his
antagonist the Laird of Balmawhapple. However, having received the
expected, or rather the required, compliment on his sobriety, the Baron
proceeded--â€˜No, sir, though I am myself of a strong temperament, I abhor
ebriety, and detest those who swallow wine gulce causa, for the
oblectation of the gullet; albeit I might deprecate the law of Pittacus
of Mitylene, who punished doubly a crime committed under the influence of
â€˜Liber Paterâ€™; nor would I utterly accede to the objurgation of the
younger Plinius, in the fourteenth book of his â€˜Historia Naturalis.â€™ No,
sir, I distinguish, I discriminate, and approve of wine so far only as it
maketh glad the face, or, in the language of Flaccus, recepto amico.â€™

Thus terminated the apology which the Baron of Bradwardine thought it
necessary to make for the superabundance of his hospitality; and it may
be easily believed that he was neither interrupted by dissent nor any
expression of incredulity.

He then invited his guest to a morning ride, and ordered that Davie
Gellatley should meet them at the dern path with Ban and Buscar. â€˜For,
until the shooting season commence, I would willingly show you some
sport, and we may, God willing, meet with a roe. The roe, Captain
Waverley, may be hunted at all times alike; for never being in what is
called PRIDE OF GREASE, he is also never out of season, though it be a
truth that his venison is not equal to that of either the red or fallow
deer. [Footnote: The learned in cookery dissent from the Baron of
Bradwardine, and hold the roe venison dry and indifferent food, unless
when dressed in soup and Scotch collops.] But he will serve to show how
my dogs run; and therefore they shall attend us with David Gellatley.â€™

Waverley expressed his surprise that his friend Davie was capable of such
trust; but the Baron gave him to understand that this poor simpleton was
neither fatuous, nec naturaliter idiota, as is expressed in the brieves
of furiosity, but simply a crack-brained knave, who could execute very
well any commission which jumped with his own humour, and made his folly
a plea for avoiding every other. â€˜He has made an interest with us,â€™
continued the Baron, â€˜by saving Rose from a great danger with his own
proper peril; and the roguish loon must therefore eat of our bread and
drink of our cup, and do what he can, or what he will, which, if the
suspicions of Saunderson and the Bailie are well founded, may perchance
in his case be commensurate terms.â€™

Miss Bradwardine then gave Waverley to understand that this poor
simpleton was dotingly fond of music, deeply affected by that which was
melancholy, and transported into extravagant gaiety by light and lively
airs. He had in this respect a prodigious memory, stored with
miscellaneous snatches and fragments of all tunes and songs, which he
sometimes applied, with considerable address, as the vehicles of
remonstrance, explanation, or satire. Davie was much attached to the few
who showed him kindness; and both aware of any slight or ill usage which
he happened to receive, and sufficiently apt, where he saw opportunity,
to revenge it. The common people, who often judge hardly of each other as
well as of their betters, although they had expressed great compassion
for the poor innocent while suffered to wander in rags about the village,
no sooner beheld him decently clothed, provided for, and even a sort of
favourite, than they called up all the instances of sharpness and
ingenuity, in action and repartee, which his annals afforded, and
charitably bottomed thereupon a hypothesis that David Gellatley was no
farther fool than was necessary to avoid hard labour. This opinion was
not better founded than that of the Negroes, who, from the acute and
mischievous pranks of the monkeys, suppose that they have the gift of
speech, and only suppress their powers of elocution to escape being set
to work. But the hypothesis was entirely imaginary; David Gellatley was
in good earnest the half-crazed simpleton which he appeared, and was
incapable of any constant and steady exertion. He had just so much
solidity as kept on the windy side of insanity, so much wild wit as saved
him from the imputation of idiocy, some dexterity in field-sports (in
which we have known as great fools excel), great kindness and humanity in
the treatment of animals entrusted to him, warm affections, a prodigious
memory, and an ear for music.

The stamping of horses was now heard in the court, and Davieâ€™s voice
singing to the two large deer greyhounds,

    Hie away, hie away,
    Over bank and over brae,
    Where the copsewood is the greenest,
    Where the fountains glisten sheenest,
    Where the lady-fern grows strongest,
    Where the morning dew lies longest,
    Where the black-cock sweetest sips it,
    Where the fairy latest trips it.
    Hie to haunts right seldom seen,
    Lovely, lonesome, cool, and green,
    Over bank and over brae,
    Hie away, hie away.


â€˜Do the verses he sings,â€™ asked Waverley, â€˜belong to old Scottish poetry,
Miss Bradwardine?â€™

â€˜I believe not,â€™ she replied. â€˜This poor creature had a brother, and
Heaven, as if to compensate to the family Davieâ€™s deficiencies, had given
him what the hamlet thought uncommon talents. An uncle contrived to
educate him for the Scottish kirk, but he could not get preferment
because he came from our GROUND. He returned from college hopeless and
brokenhearted, and fell into a decline. My father supported him till his
death, which happened before he was nineteen. He played beautifully on
the flute, and was supposed to have a great turn for poetry. He was
affectionate and compassionate to his brother, who followed him like his
shadow, and we think that from him Davie gathered many fragments of songs
and music unlike those of this country. But if we ask him where he got
such a fragment as he is now singing, he either answers with wild and
long fits of laughter, or else breaks into tears of lamentation; but was
never heard to give any explanation, or to mention his brotherâ€™s name
since his death.â€™

â€˜Surely,â€™ said Edward, who was readily interested by a tale bordering on
the romantic, â€˜surely more might be learned by more particular inquiry.â€™

â€˜Perhaps so,â€™ answered Rose; â€˜but my father will not permit any one to
practise on his feelings on this subject.â€™

By this time the Baron, with the help of Mr. Saunderson, had indued a
pair of jack-boots of large dimensions, and now invited our hero to
follow him as he stalked clattering down the ample stair-case, tapping
each huge balustrade as he passed with the   butt of his massive
horse-whip, and humming, with the air of a chasseur of Louis Quatorze,--

    Pour la chasse ordonnee il faut preparer tout.
    Ho la ho! Vite! vite debout!




CHAPTER XIII

A MORE RATIONAL DAY THAN THE LAST


The Baron of Bradwardine, mounted on an active and well-managed horse,
and seated on a demi-pique saddle, with deep housings to agree with his
livery, was no bad representative of the old school. His light-coloured
embroidered coat, and superbly barred waistcoat, his brigadier wig,
surmounted by a small gold-laced cocked-hat, completed his personal
costume; but he was attended by two well-mounted servants on horseback,
armed with holster-pistols.

In this guise he ambled forth over hill and valley, the admiration of
every farm-yard which they passed in their progress, till, â€˜low down in a
grassy vale,â€™ they found David Gellatley leading two very tall deer
greyhounds, and presiding over half a dozen curs, and about as many
bare-legged and bare-headed boys, who, to procure the chosen distinction
of attending on the chase, had not failed to tickle his ears with the
dulcet appellation of Maister Gellatley, though probably all and each had
hooted him on former occasions in the character of daft Davie. But this
is no uncommon strain of flattery to persons in office, nor altogether
confined to the barelegged villagers of Tully-Veolan; it was in fashion
Sixty Years Since, is now, and will be six hundred years hence, if this
admirable compound of folly and knavery, called the world, shall be then
in existence.

These Gillie-wet-foots, as they were called, were destined to beat the
bushes, which they performed with so much success, that, after half an
hourâ€™s search, a roe was started, coursed, and killed; the Baron
following on his white horse, like Earl Percy of yore, and magnanimously
flaying and embowelling the slain animal (which, he observed, was called
by the French chasseurs, faire la curee) with his own baronial couteau de
chasse. After this ceremony, he conducted his guest homeward by a
pleasant and circuitous route, commanding an extensive prospect of
different villages and houses, to each of which Mr. Bradwardine attached
some anecdote of history or genealogy, told in language whimsical from
prejudice and pedantry, but often respectable for the good sense and
honourable feelings which his narrative displayed, and almost always
curious, if not valuable, for the information they contained.

The truth is, the ride seemed agreeable to both gentlemen, because they
found amusement in each otherâ€™s conversation, although their characters
and habits of thinking were in many respects totally opposite. Edward, we
have informed the reader, was warm in his feelings, wild and romantic in
his ideas and in his taste of reading, with a strong disposition towards
poetry. Mr Bradwardine was the reverse of all this, and piqued himself
upon stalking through life with the same upright, starched, stoical
gravity which distinguished his evening promenade upon the terrace of
Tully-Veolan, where for hours together--the very model of old
Hardyknute--

    Stately steppâ€™d he east the waâ€™,
    And stately steppâ€™d he west

As for literature, he read the classic poets, to be sure, and the
â€˜Epithalamiumâ€™ of Georgius Buchanan and Arthur Johnstonâ€™s Psalms, of a
Sunday; and the â€˜Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum,â€™ and Sir David Lindsayâ€™s
â€˜Worksâ€™, and Barbourâ€™s â€˜Braceâ€™, and Blind Harryâ€™s â€˜Wallaceâ€™, and â€˜The
Gentle Shepherdâ€™, and â€˜The Cherry and The Slae.â€™

But though he thus far sacrificed his time to the Muses, he would, if the
truth must be spoken, have been much better pleased had the pious or
sapient apothegms, as well as the historical narratives, which these
various works contained, been presented to him in the form of simple
prose. And he sometimes could not refrain from expressing contempt of the
â€˜vain and unprofitable art of poem-makingâ€™, in which, he said, â€™the only
one who had excelled in his time was Allan Ramsay, the periwigmaker.â€™

[Footnote: The Baron ought to have remembered that the joyous Allan
literally drew his blood from the house of the noble earl whom he terms--

    Dalhousie of an old descent
    My stoup, my pride, my ornament.]

But although Edward and he differed TOTO COELO, as the Baron would have
said, upon this subject, yet they met upon history as on a neutral
ground, in which each claimed an interest. The Baron, indeed, only
cumbered his memory with matters of fact, the cold, dry, hard outlines
which history delineates. Edward, on the contrary, loved to fill up and
round the sketch with the colouring of a warm and vivid imagination,
which gives light and life to the actors and speakers in the drama of
past ages. Yet with tastes so opposite, they contributed greatly to each
otherâ€™s amusement. Mr. Bradwardineâ€™s minute narratives and powerful
memory supplied to Waverley fresh subjects of the kind upon which his
fancy loved to labour, and opened to him a new mine of incident and of
character. And he repaid the pleasure thus communicated by an earnest
attention, valuable to all story-tellers, more especially to the Baron,
who felt his habits of self-respect flattered by it; and sometimes also
by reciprocal communications, which interested Mr. Bradwardine, as
confirming or illustrating his own favourite anecdotes. Besides, Mr.
Bradwardine loved to talk of the scenes of his youth, which had been
spent in camps and foreign lands, and had many interesting particulars to
tell of the generals under whom he had served and the actions he had
witnessed.

Both parties returned to Tully-Veolan in great good-humour with each
other; Waverley desirous of studying more attentively what he considered
as a singular and interesting character, gifted with a memory containing
a curious register of ancient and modern anecdotes; and Bradwardine
disposed to regard Edward as puer (or rather juvenis) bonae spei et
magnae indolis, a youth devoid of that petulant volatility which is
impatient of, or vilipends, the conversation and advice of his seniors,
from which he predicted great things of his future success and deportment
in life. There was no other guest except Mr. Rubrick, whose information
and discourse, as a clergyman and a scholar, harmonised very well with
that of the Baron and his guest.

Shortly after dinner, the Baron, as if to show that his temperance was
not entirely theoretical, proposed a visit to Roseâ€™s apartment, or, as he
termed it, her troisieme etage. Waverley was accordingly conducted
through one or two of those long awkward passages with which ancient
architects studied to puzzle the inhabitants of the houses which they
planned, at the end of which Mr. Bradwardine began to ascend, by two
steps at once, a very steep, narrow, and winding stair, leaving Mr.
Rubrick and Waverley to follow at more leisure, while he should announce
their approach to his daughter.

After having climbed this perpendicular corkscrew until their brains were
almost giddy, they arrived in a little matted lobby, which served as an
anteroom to Roseâ€™s sanctum sanctorum, and through which they entered her
parlour. It was a small, but pleasant apartment, opening to the south,
and hung with tapestry; adorned besides with two pictures, one of her
mother, in the dress of a shepherdess, with a bell-hoop; the other of the
Baron, in his tenth year, in a blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, laced
hat, and bag-wig, with a bow in his hand. Edward could not help smiling
at the costume, and at the odd resemblance between the round, smooth,
red-cheeked, staring visage in the portrait, and the gaunt, bearded,
hollow-eyed, swarthy features, which travelling, fatigues of war, and
advanced age, had bestowed on the original. The Baron joined in the
laugh. â€˜Truly,â€™ he said, â€˜that picture was a womanâ€™s fantasy of my good
motherâ€™s (a daughter of the Laird of Tulliellum, Captain Waverley; I
indicated the house to you when we were on the top of the Shinnyheuch; it
was burnt by the Dutch auxiliaries brought in by the Government in 1715);
I never sate for my pourtraicture but once since that was painted, and it
was at the special and reiterated request of the Marechal Duke of
Berwick.â€™

The good old gentleman did not mention what Mr. Rubrick afterwards told
Edward, that the Duke had done him this honour on account of his being
the first to mount the breach of a fort in Savoy during the memorable
campaign of 1709, and his having there defended himself with his
half-pike for nearly ten minutes before any support reached him. To do
the Baron justice, although sufficiently prone to dwell upon, and even to
exaggerate, his family dignity and consequence, he was too much a man of
real courage ever to allude to such personal acts of merit as he had
himself manifested.

Miss Rose now appeared from the interior room of her apartment, to
welcome her father and his friends. The little labours in which she had
been employed obviously showed a natural taste, which required only
cultivation. Her father had taught her French and Italian, and a few of
the ordinary authors in those languages ornamented her shelves. He had
endeavoured also to be her preceptor in music; but as he began with the
more abstruse doctrines of the science, and was not perhaps master of
them himself, she had made no proficiency farther than to be able to
accompany her voice with the harpsichord; but even this was not very
common in Scotland at that period. To make amends, she sung with great
taste and feeling, and with a respect to the sense of what she uttered
that might be proposed in example to ladies of much superior musical
talent. Her natural good sense taught her that, if, as we are assured by
high authority, music be â€˜married to immortal verse,â€™ they are very often
divorced by the performer in a most shameful manner. It was perhaps owing
to this sensibility to poetry, and power of combining its expression with
those of the musical notes, that her singing gave more pleasure to all
the unlearned in music, and even to many of the learned, than could have
been communicated by a much finer voice and more brilliant execution
unguided by the same delicacy of feeling.

A bartizan, or projecting gallery, before the windows of her parlour,
served to illustrate another of Roseâ€™s pursuits; for it was crowded with
flowers of different kinds, which she had taken under her special
protection. A projecting turret gave access to this Gothic balcony, which
commanded a most beautiful prospect. The formal garden, with its high
bounding walls, lay below, contracted, as it seemed, to a mere parterre;
while the view extended beyond them down a wooded glen, where the small
river was sometimes visible, sometimes hidden in copse. The eye might be
delayed by a desire to rest on the rocks, which here and there rose from
the dell with massive or spiry fronts, or it might dwell on the noble,
though ruined tower, which was here beheld in all its dignity, frowning
from a promontory over the river. To the left were seen two or three
cottages, a part of the village, the brow of the hill concealed the
others. The glen, or dell, was terminated by a sheet of water, called
Loch Veolan, into which the brook discharged itself, and which now
glistened in the western sun. The distant country seemed open and varied
in surface, though not wooded; and there was nothing to interrupt the
view until the scene was bounded by a ridge of distant and blue hills,
which formed the southern boundary of the strath or valley. To this
pleasant station Miss Bradwardine had ordered coffee.

The view of the old tower, or fortalice, introduced some family anecdotes
and tales of Scottish chivalry, which the Baron told with great
enthusiasm. The projecting peak of an impending crag which rose near it
had acquired the name of Saint Swithinâ€™s Chair. It was the scene of a
peculiar superstition, of which Mr. Rubrick mentioned some curious
particulars, which reminded Waverley of a rhyme quoted by Edgar in King
Lear; and Rose was called upon to sing a little legend, in which they had
been interwoven by some village poet,

    Who, noteless as the race from which he sprung,
    Saved othersâ€™ names, but left his own unsung.

The sweetness of her voice, and the simple beauty of her music, gave all
the advantage which the minstrel could have desired, and which his poetry
so much wanted. I almost doubt if it can be read with patience, destitute
of these advantages, although I conjecture the following copy to have
been somewhat corrected by Waverley, to suit the taste of those who might
not relish pure antiquity.

              Saint Swithinâ€™s Chair

      On Hallow-Mass Eve, ere ye boune ye to rest,
      Ever beware that your couch be blessâ€™d;
      Sign it with cross, and sain it with bead,
      Sing the Ave, and say the Creed.

      For on Hallow-Mass Eve the Night-Hag will ride,
      And all her nine-fold sweeping on by her side,
      Whether the wind sing lowly or loud,
      Sailing through moonshine or swathâ€™d in the cloud.

      The Lady she sat in Saint Swithinâ€™s Chair,
      The dew of the night has dampâ€™d her hair:
      Her cheek was pale; but resolved and high
      Was the word of her lip and the glance of her eye.

      She mutterâ€™d the spell of Swithin bold,
      When his naked foot traced the midnight wold,
      When he stoppâ€™d the Hag as she rode the night,
      And bade her descend, and her promise plight.

       He that dare sit on Saint Swithinâ€™s Chair,
       When the Night-Hag wings the troubled air,
       Questions three, when he speaks the spell,
       He may ask, and she must tell.

       The Baron has been with King Robert his liege
       These three long years in battle and siege;
       News are there none of his weal or his woe,
       And fain the Lady his fate would know.

       She shudders and stops as the charm she speaks;--
       Is it the moody owl that shrieks?
       Or is it that sound, betwixt laughter and scream,
       The voice of the Demon who haunts the stream?

       The moan of the wind sunk silent and low,
       And the roaring torrent had ceased to flow;
       The calm was more dreadful than raging storm,
       When the cold grey mist brought the ghastly Form!

â€˜I am sorry to disappoint the company, especially Captain Waverley, who
listens with such laudable gravity; it is but a fragment, although I
think there are other verses, describing the return of the Baron from the
wars, and how the lady was found â€œclay-cold upon the grounsill ledge.â€™â€

â€˜It is one of those figments,â€™ observed Mr. Bradwardine, â€˜with which the
early history of distinguished families was deformed in the times of
superstition; as that of Rome, and other ancient nations, had their
prodigies, sir, the which you may read in ancient histories, or in the
little work compiled by Julius Obsequens, and inscribed by the learned
Scheffer, the editor, to his patron, Benedictus Skytte, Baron of
Dudershoff.â€™

â€˜My father has a strange defiance of the marvellous, Captain Waverley,â€™
observed Rose, â€˜and once stood firm when a whole synod of Presbyterian
divines were put to the rout by a sudden apparition of the foul fiend.â€™

Waverley looked as if desirous to hear more.

â€˜Must I tell my story as well as sing my song? Well--Once upon a time
there lived an old woman, called Janet Gellatley, who was suspected to be
a witch, on the infallible grounds that she was very old, very ugly, very
poor, and had two sons, one of whom was a poet and the other a fool,
which visitation, all the neighbourhood agreed, had come upon her for the
sin of witchcraft. And she was imprisoned for a week in the steeple of
the parish church, and sparely supplied with food, and not permitted to
sleep until she herself became as much persuaded of her being a witch as
her accusers; and in this lucid and happy state of mind was brought forth
to make a clean breast, that is, to make open confession of her
sorceries, before all the Whig gentry and ministers in the vicinity, who
were no conjurors themselves. My father went to see fair play between the
witch and the clergy; for the witch had been born on his estate. And
while the witch was confessing that the Enemy appeared, and made his
addresses to her as a handsome black man,--which, if you could have seen
poor old blear-eyed Janet, reflected little honour on Apollyonâ€™s
taste,--and while the auditors listened with astonished ears, and the
clerk recorded with a trembling hand, she, all of a sudden, changed the
low mumbling tone with which she spoke into a shrill yell, and exclaimed,
â€œLook to yourselves! look to yourselves! I see the Evil One sitting in
the midst of ye.â€ The surprise was general, and terror and flight its
immediate consequences. Happy were those who were next the door; and many
were the disasters that befell hats, bands, cuffs, and wigs, before they
could get out of the church, where they left the obstinate prelatist to
settle matters with the witch and her admirer at his own peril or
pleasure.â€™

â€˜Risu solvuntur tabulae,â€™ said the Baron; â€˜when they recovered their
panic trepidation they were too much ashamed to bring any wakening of the
process against Janet Gellatley.â€™ [Footnote: See Note 36]

This anecdote led to a long discussion of

         All those idle thoughts and fantasies,
         Devices, dreams, opinions unsound,
         Shows, visions, soothsays, and prophecies,
         And all that feigned is, as leasings, tales, and lies.
With such conversation, and the romantic legends which it introduced,
closed our heroâ€™s second evening in the house of Tully-Veolan.




CHAPTER XIV

A DISCOVERY--WAVERLEY BECOMES DOMESTICATED AT TULLY-VEOLAN


The next day Edward arose betimes, and in a morning walk around the house
and its vicinity came suddenly upon a small court in front of the
dog-kennel, where his friend Davie was employed about his four-footed
charge. One quick glance of his eye recognised Waverley, when, instantly
turning his back, as if he had not observed him, he began to sing part of
an old ballad:--

    Young men will love thee more fair and more fast;
      Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
    Old menâ€™s love the longest will last,
      And the throstle-cockâ€™s head is under his wing.

    The young manâ€™s wrath is like light straw on fire;
      Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
    But like red-hot steel is the old manâ€™s ire,
      And the throstle-cockâ€™s head is under his wing.

    The young man will brawl at the evening board;
      Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
    But the old man will draw at the dawning the sword,
      And the throstle-cockâ€™s head is under his wing.

Waverley could not avoid observing that Davie laid something like a
satirical emphasis on these lines. He therefore approached, and
endeavoured, by sundry queries, to elicit from him what the innuendo
might mean; but Davie had no mind to explain, and had wit enough to make
his folly cloak his knavery. Edward could collect nothing from him,
excepting that the Laird of Balmawhapple had gone home yesterday morning
â€˜wiâ€™ his boots fuâ€™ oâ€™ bluid.â€™ In the garden, however, he met the old
butler, who no longer attempted to conceal that, having been bred in the
nursery line with Sumack and Co. of Newcastle, he sometimes wrought a
turn in the flower-borders to oblige the Laird and Miss Rose. By a series
of queries, Edward at length discovered, with a painful feeling of
surprise and shame, that Balmawhappleâ€™s submission and apology had been
the consequence of a rencontre with the Baron before his guest had
quitted his pillow, in which the younger combatant had been disarmed and
wounded in the sword arm.

Greatly mortified at this information, Edward sought out his friendly
host, and anxiously expostulated with him upon the injustice he had done
him in anticipating his meeting with Mr. Falconer, a circumstance which,
considering his youth and the profession of arms which he had just
adopted, was capable of being represented much to his prejudice. The
Baron justified himself at greater length than I choose to repeat. He
urged that the quarrel was common to them, and that Balmawhapple could
not, by the code of honour, evite giving satisfaction to both, which he
had done in his case by an honourable meeting, and in that of Edward by
such a palinode as rendered the use of the sword unnecessary, and which,
being made and accepted, must necessarily sopite the whole affair.

With this excuse, or explanation, Waverley was silenced, if not
satisfied; but he could not help testifying some displeasure against the
Blessed Bear, which had given rise to the quarrel, nor refrain from
hinting that the sanctified epithet was hardly appropriate. The Baron
observed, he could not deny that â€˜the Bear, though allowed by heralds as
a most honourable ordinary, had, nevertheless, somewhat fierce, churlish,
and morose in his disposition (as might be read in Archibald Simson,
pastor of Dalkeithâ€™s â€˜Hieroglyphica Animaliumâ€™) and had thus been the
type of many quarrels and dissensions which had occurred in the house of
Bradwardine; of which,â€™ he continued, â€˜I might commemorate mine own
unfortunate dissension with my third cousin by the motherâ€™s side, Sir Hew
Halbert, who was so unthinking as to deride my family name, as if it had
been QUASI BEAR-WARDEN; a most uncivil jest, since it not only insinuated
that the founder of our house occupied such a mean situation as to be a
custodier of wild beasts, a charge which, ye must have observed, is only
entrusted to the very basest plebeians; but, moreover, seemed to infer
that our coat-armour had not been achieved by honourable actions in war,
but bestowed by way of paranomasia, or pun, upon our family
appellation,--a sort of bearing which the French call armoires parlantes,
the Latins arma cantantia, and your English authorities canting heraldry,
[Footnote: See Note 37] being indeed a species of emblazoning more
befitting canters, gaberlunzies, and such like mendicants, whose
gibberish is formed upon playing upon the word, than the noble,
honourable, and useful science of heraldry, which assigns armorial
bearings as the reward of noble and generous actions, and not to tickle
the ear with vain quodlibets, such as are found in jestbooks.â€™ Of his
quarrel with Sir Hew he said nothing more than that it was settled in a
fitting manner.

Having been so minute with respect to the diversions of Tully-Veolan on
the first days of Edwardâ€™s arrival, for the purpose of introducing its
inmates to the readerâ€™s acquaintance, it becomes less necessary to trace
the progress of his intercourse with the same accuracy. It is probable
that a young man, accustomed to more cheerful society, would have tired
of the conversation of so violent an assertor of the â€˜boast of heraldryâ€™
as the Baron; but Edward found an agreeable variety in that of Miss
Bradwardine, who listened with eagerness to his remarks upon literature,
and showed great justness of taste in her answers. The sweetness of her
disposition had made her submit with complacency, and even pleasure, to
the course of reading prescribed by her father, although it not only
comprehended several heavy folios of history, but certain gigantic tomes
in high-church polemics. In heraldry he was fortunately contented to give
her only such a slight tincture as might be acquired by perusal of the
two folio volumes of Nisbet. Rose was indeed the very apple of her
fatherâ€™s eye. Her constant liveliness, her attention to all those little
observances most gratifying to those who would never think of exacting
them, her beauty, in which he recalled the features of his beloved wife,
her unfeigned piety, and the noble generosity of her disposition, would
have justified the affection of the most doting father.





His anxiety on her behalf did not, however, seem to extend itself in that
quarter where, according to the general opinion, it is most efficiently
displayed, in labouring, namely, to establish her in life, either by a
large dowry or a wealthy marriage. By an old settlement, almost all the
landed estates of the Baron went, after his death, to a distant relation;
and it was supposed that Miss Bradwardine would remain but slenderly
provided for, as the good gentlemanâ€™s cash matters had been too long
under the exclusive charge of Bailie Macwheeble to admit of any great
expectations from his personal succession. It is true, the said Bailie
loved his patron and his patronâ€™s daughter next (though at an
incomparable distance) to himself. He thought it was possible to set
aside the settlement on the male line, and had actually procured an
opinion to that effect (and, as he boasted, without a fee) from an
eminent Scottish counsel, under whose notice he contrived to bring the
point while consulting him regularly on some other business. But the
Baron would not listen to such a proposal for an instant. On the
contrary, he used to have a perverse pleasure in boasting that the barony
of Bradwardine was a male fief, the first charter having been given at
that early period when women were not deemed capable to hold a feudal
grant; because, according to Les coustusmes de Normandie, câ€™est lâ€™homme
ki se bast et ki conseille; or, as is yet more ungallantly expressed by
other authorities, all of whose barbarous names he delighted to quote at
full length, because a woman could not serve the superior, or feudal
lord, in war, on account of the decorum of her sex, nor assist him with
advice, because of her limited intellect, nor keep his counsel, owing to
the infirmity of her disposition. He would triumphantly ask, how it would
become a female, and that female a Bradwardine, to be seen employed in
servitio exuendi, seu detrahendi, caligas regis post battaliam? that is,
in pulling off the kingâ€™s boots after an engagement, which was the feudal
service by which he held the barony of Bradwardine. â€˜No,â€™ he said,
â€˜beyond hesitation, procul dubio, many females, as worthy as Rose, had
been excluded, in order to make way for my own succession, and Heaven
forbid that I should do aught that might contravene the destination of my
forefathers, or impinge upon the right of my kinsman, Malcolm Bradwardine
of Inchgrabbit, an honourable, though decayed branch of my own family.â€™

The Bailie, as prime minister, having received this decisive
communication from his sovereign, durst not press his own opinion any
farther, but contented himself with deploring, on all suitable occasions,
to Saunderson, the minister of the interior, the lairdâ€™s self-willedness,
and with laying plans for uniting Rose with the young Laird of
Balmawhapple, who had a fine estate, only moderately burdened, and was a
faultless young gentleman, being as sober as a saint--if you keep brandy
from him and him from brandy--and who, in brief, had no imperfection but
that of keeping light company at a time; such as Jinker, the
horse-couper, and Gibby Gaethroughwiâ€™t, the piper oâ€™ Cupar; â€˜oâ€™ whilk
follies, Mr. Saunderson, heâ€™ll mend, heâ€™ll mend,â€™ pronounced the Bailie.

â€˜Like sour ale in simmer,â€™ added Davie Gellatley, who happened to be
nearer the conclave than they were aware of.

Miss Bradwardine, such as we have described her, with all the simplicity
and curiosity of a recluse, attached herself to the opportunities of
increasing her store of literature which Edwardâ€™s visit afforded her. He
sent for some of his books from his quarters, and they opened to her
sources of delight of which she had hitherto had no idea. The best
English poets, of every description, and other works on belles-lettres,
made a part of this precious cargo. Her music, even her flowers, were
neglected, and Saunders not only mourned over, but began to mutiny
against, the labour for which he now scarce received thanks. These new
pleasures became gradually enhanced by sharing them with one of a kindred
taste. Edwardâ€™s readiness to comment, to recite, to explain difficult
passages, rendered his assistance invaluable; and the wild romance of his
spirit delighted a character too young and inexperienced to observe its
deficiencies. Upon subjects which interested him, and when quite at ease,
he possessed that flow of natural, and somewhat florid eloquence, which
has been supposed as powerful even as figure, fashion, fame, or fortune,
in winning the female heart. There was, therefore, an increasing danger
in this constant intercourse to poor Roseâ€™s peace of mind, which was the
more imminent as her father was greatly too much abstracted in his
studies, and wrapped up in his own dignity, to dream of his daughterâ€™s
incurring it. The daughters of the house of Bradwardine were, in his
opinion, like those of the house of Bourbon or Austria, placed high above
the clouds of passion which might obfuscate the intellects of meaner
females; they moved in another sphere, were governed by other feelings,
and amenable to other rules than those of idle and fantastic affection.
In short, he shut his eyes so resolutely to the natural consequences of
Edwardâ€™s intimacy with Miss Bradwardine, that the whole neighbourhood
concluded that he had opened them to the advantages of a match between
his daughter and the wealthy young Englishman, and pronounced him much
less a fool than he had generally shown himself in cases where his own
interest was concerned.

If the Baron, however, had really meditated such an alliance, the
indifference of Waverley would have been an insuperable bar to his
project. Our hero, since mixing more freely with the world, had learned
to think with great shame and confusion upon his mental legend of Saint
Cecilia, and the vexation of these reflections was likely, for some time
at least, to counterbalance the natural susceptibility of his
disposition. Besides, Rose Bradwardine, beautiful and amiable as we have
described her, had not precisely the sort of beauty or merit which
captivates a romantic imagination in early youth. She was too frank, too
confiding, too kind; amiable qualities, undoubtedly, but destructive of
the marvellous, with which a youth of imagination delights to dress the
empress of his affections. Was it possible to bow, to tremble, and to
adore, before the timid, yet playful little girl, who now asked Edward to
mend her pen, now to construe a stanza in Tasso, and now how to spell a
very--very long word in her version of it? All these incidents have their
fascination on the mind at a certain period of life, but not when a youth
is entering it, and rather looking out for some object whose affection
may dignify him in his own eyes than stooping to one who looks up to him
for such distinction. Hence, though there can be no rule in so capricious
a passion, early love is frequently ambitious in choosing its object; or,
which comes to the same, selects her (as in the case of Saint Cecilia
aforesaid) from a situation that gives fair scope for le beau ideal,
which the reality of intimate and familiar life rather tends to limit and
impair. I knew a very accomplished and sensible young man cured of a
violent passion for a pretty woman, whose talents were not equal to her
face and figure, by being permitted to bear her company for a whole
afternoon. Thus, it is certain, that had Edward enjoyed such an
opportunity of conversing with Miss Stubbs, Aunt Rachelâ€™s precaution
would have been unnecessary, for he would as soon have fallen in love
with the dairy-maid. And although Miss Bradwardine was a very different
character, it seems probable that the very intimacy of their intercourse
prevented his feeling for her other sentiments than those of a brother
for an amiable and accomplished sister; while the sentiments of poor Rose
were gradually, and without her being conscious, assuming a shade of
warmer affection.

I ought to have said that Edward, when he sent to Dundee for the books
before mentioned, had applied for, and received permission, extending his
leave of absence. But the letter of his commanding officer contained a
friendly recommendation to him not to spend his time exclusively with
persons who, estimable as they might be in a general sense, could not be
supposed well affected to a government which they declined to acknowledge
by taking the oath of allegiance. The letter further insinuated, though
with great delicacy, that although some family connections might be
supposed to render it necessary for Captain Waverley to communicate with
gentlemen who were in this unpleasant state of suspicion, yet his
fatherâ€™s situation and wishes ought to prevent his prolonging those
attentions into exclusive intimacy. And it was intimated, that, while his
political principles were endangered by communicating with laymen of this
description, he might also receive erroneous impressions in religion from
the prelatic clergy, who so perversely laboured to set up the royal
prerogative in things sacred.

This last insinuation probably induced Waverley to set both down to the
prejudices of his commanding officer. He was sensible that Mr.
Bradwardine had acted with the most scrupulous delicacy, in never
entering upon any discussion that had the most remote tendency to bias
his mind in political opinions, although he was himself not only a
decided partisan of the exiled family, but had been trusted at different
times with important commissions for their service. Sensible, therefore,
that there was no risk of his being perverted from his allegiance, Edward
felt as if he should do his uncleâ€™s old friend injustice in removing from
a house where he gave and received pleasure and amusement, merely to
gratify a prejudiced and ill-judged suspicion. He therefore wrote a very
general answer, assuring his commanding officer that his loyalty was not
in the most distant danger of contamination, and continued an honoured
guest and inmate of the house of Tully-Veolan.




CHAPTER XV

A CREAGH, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES


When Edward had been a guest at Tully-Veolan nearly six weeks, he
descried, one morning, as he took his usual walk before the breakfast
hour, signs of uncommon perturbation in the family. Four bare-legged
dairy-maids, with each an empty milk-pail in her hand, ran about with
frantic gestures, and uttering loud exclamations of surprise, grief, and
resentment. From their appearance, a pagan might have conceived them a
detachment of the celebrated Belides, just come from their baling
penance. As nothing was to be got from this distracted chorus, excepting
â€˜Lord guide us!â€™ and â€˜Eh sirs!â€™ ejaculations which threw no light upon
the cause of their dismay, Waverley repaired to the fore-court, as it was
called, where he beheld Bailie Macwheeble cantering his white pony down
the avenue with all the speed it could muster. He had arrived, it would
seem, upon a hasty summons, and was followed by half a score of peasants
from the village who had no great difficulty in keeping pace with him.

The Bailie, greatly too busy and too important to enter into explanations
with Edward, summoned forth Mr. Saunderson, who appeared with a
countenance in which dismay was mingled with solemnity, and they
immediately entered into close conference. Davie Gellatley was also seen
in the group, idle as Diogenes at Sinope while his countrymen were
preparing for a siege. His spirits always rose with anything, good or
bad, which occasioned tumult, and he continued frisking, hopping,
dancing, and singing the burden of an old ballad--

    â€˜Our gearâ€™s aâ€™ gane,â€™

until, happening to pass too near the Bailie, he received an admonitory
hint from his horse-whip, which converted his songs into lamentation.

Passing from thence towards the garden, Waverley beheld the Baron in
person, measuring and re-measuring, with swift and tremendous strides,
the length of the terrace; his countenance clouded with offended pride
and indignation, and the whole of his demeanour such as seemed to
indicate, that any inquiry concerning the cause of his discomposure would
give pain at least, if not offence. Waverley therefore glided into the
house, without addressing him, and took his way to the breakfast-parlour,
where he found his young friend Rose, who, though she neither exhibited
the resentment of her father, the turbid importance of Bailie Macwheeble,
nor the despair of the handmaidens, seemed vexed and thoughtful. A single
word explained the mystery. â€˜Your breakfast will be a disturbed one,
Captain Waverley. A party of Caterans have come down upon us last night,
and have driven off all our milch cows.â€™

â€˜A party of Caterans?â€™

â€˜Yes; robbers from the neighbouring Highlands. We used to be quite free
from them while we paid blackmail to Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr; but
my father thought it unworthy of his rank and birth to pay it any longer,
and so this disaster has happened. It is not the value of the cattle,
Captain Waverley, that vexes me; but my father is so much hurt at the
affront, and is so bold and hot, that I fear he will try to recover them
by the strong hand; and if he is not hurt himself, he will hurt some of
these wild people, and then there will be no peace between them and us
perhaps for our life-time; and we cannot defend ourselves as in old
times, for the government have taken all our arms; and my dear father is
so rash--O what will become of us!â€™--Here poor Rose lost heart
altogether, and burst into a flood of tears.

The Baron entered at this moment, and rebuked her with more asperity than
Waverley had ever heard him use to any one. â€˜Was it not a shame,â€™ he
said, â€˜that she should exhibit herself before any gentleman in such a
light, as if she shed tears for a drove of horned nolt and milch kine,
like the daughter of a Cheshire yeoman!--Captain Waverley, I must request
your favourable construction of her grief, which may, or ought to
proceed, solely from seeing her fatherâ€™s estate exposed to spulzie and
depredation from common thieves and sorners, while we are not allowed to
keep half a score of muskets, whether for defence or rescue.â€™

Bailie Macwheeble entered immediately afterwards, and by his report of
arms and ammunition confirmed this statement, informing the Baron, in a
melancholy voice, that though the people would certainly obey his
honourâ€™s orders, yet there was no chance of their following the gear to
ony guid purpose, in respect there were only his honourâ€™s body servants
who had swords and pistols, and the depredators were twelve Highlanders,
completely armed after the manner of their country. Having delivered this
doleful annunciation, he assumed a posture of silent dejection, shaking
his head slowly with the motion of a pendulum when it is ceasing to
vibrate, and then remained stationary, his body stooping at a more acute
angle than usual, and the latter part of his person projecting in
proportion.

The Baron, meanwhile, paced the room in silent indignation, and at length
fixing his eye upon an old portrait, whose person was clad in armour, and
whose features glared grimly out of a huge bush of hair, part of which
descended from his head to his shoulders, and part from his chin and
upper-lip to his breast-plate,--â€˜That gentleman, Captain Waverley, my
grandsire,â€™ he said, â€˜with two hundred horse,--whom he levied within his
own bounds, discomfited and put to the rout more than five hundred of
these Highland reivers, who have been ever lapis offensionis et petra
scandali, a stumbling-block and a rock of offence, to the Lowland
vicinage--he discomfited them, I say, when they had the temerity to
descend to harry this country, in the time of the civil dissensions, in
the year of grace sixteen hundred forty and two. And now, sir, I, his
grandson, am thus used at such unworthy hands.â€™

Here there was an awful pause; after which all the company, as is usual
in cases of difficulty, began to give separate and inconsistent counsel.
Alexander ab Alexandro proposed they should send some one to compound
with the Caterans, who would readily, he said, give up their prey for a
dollar a head. The Bailie opined that this transaction would amount to
theft-boot, or composition of felony; and he recommended that some canny
hand should be sent up to the glens to make the best bargain he could, as
it were for himself, so that the Laird might not be seen in such a
transaction. Edward proposed to send off to the nearest garrison for a
party of soldiers and a magistrateâ€™s warrant; and Rose, as far as she
dared, endeavoured to insinuate the course of paying the arrears of
tribute money to Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, who, they all knew, could
easily procure restoration of the cattle, if he were properly
propitiated.

None of these proposals met the Baronâ€™s approbation. The idea of
composition, direct or implied, was absolutely ignominious; that of
Waverley only showed that he did not understand the state of the country,
and of the political parties which divided it; and, standing matters as
they did with Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr, the Baron would make no
concession to him, were it, he said, â€˜to procure restitution in integrum
of every stirk and stot that the chief, his forefathers, and his clan,
had stolen since the days of Malcolm Canmore.â€™

In fact his voice was still for war, and he proposed to send expresses to
Balmawhapple, Killancureit, Tulliellum, and other lairds, who were
exposed to similar depredations, inviting them to join in the pursuit;
â€˜and then, sir, shall these nebulones nequissimi, as Leslaeus calls them,
be brought to the fate of their predecessor Cacus,

    â€œElisos oculos, et siccum sanguine guttur.â€â€™

The Bailie, who by no means relished these warlike counsels, here pulled
forth an immense watch, of the colour, and nearly of the size, of a
pewter warming-pan, and observed it was now past noon, and that the
Caterans had been seen in the pass of Ballybrough soon after sunrise; so
that, before the allied forces could assemble, they and their prey would
be far beyond the reach of the most active pursuit, and sheltered in
those pathless deserts, where it was neither advisable to follow, nor
indeed possible to trace them.

This proposition was undeniable. The council therefore broke up without
coming to any conclusion, as has occurred to councils of more importance;
only it was determined that the Bailie should send his own three milkcows
down to the mains for the use of the Baronâ€™s family, and brew small ale,
as a substitute for milk, in his own. To this arrangement, which was
suggested by Saunderson, the Bailie readily assented, both from habitual
deference to the family, and an internal consciousness that his courtesy
would, in some mode or other, be repaid tenfold.

The Baron having also retired to give some necessary directions, Waverley
seized the opportunity to ask, whether this Fergus, with the
unpronounceable name, was the chief thief-taker of the district?

â€˜Thief-taker!â€™ answered Rose, laughing; â€˜he is a gentleman of great
honour and consequence, the chieftain of an independent branch of a
powerful Highland clan, and is much respected, both for his own power and
that of his kith, kin, and allies.â€™

â€˜And what has he to do with the thieves, then? Is he a magistrate, or in
the commission of the peace?â€™ asked Waverley.

â€˜The commission of war rather, if there be such a thing,â€™ said Rose; â€˜for
he is a very unquiet neighbour to his unfriends, and keeps a greater
following on foot than many that have thrice his estate. As to his
connection with the thieves, that I cannot well explain; but the boldest
of them will never steal a hoof from any one that pays black-mail to Vich
Ian Vohr.â€™

â€˜And what is black-mail?â€™

â€˜A sort of protection-money that Low-Country gentlemen and heritors,
lying near the Highlands, pay to some Highland chief, that he may neither
do them harm himself, nor suffer it to be done to them by others; and
then if your cattle are stolen, you have only to send him word, and he
will recover them; or it may be, he will drive away cows from some
distant place, where he has a quarrel, and give them to you to make up
your loss.â€™ [Footnote: See note 13.]

â€˜And is this sort of Highland Jonathan Wild admitted into society, and
called a gentleman?â€™

â€˜So much so,â€™ said Rose, â€˜that the quarrel between my father and Fergus
Mac-Ivor began at a county meeting, where he wanted to take precedence of
all the Lowland gentlemen then present, only my father would not suffer
it. And then he upbraided my father that he was under his banner, and
paid him tribute; and my father was in a towering passion, for Bailie
Macwheeble, who manages such things his own way, had contrived to keep
this black-mail a secret from him, and passed it in his account for
cess-money. And they would have fought; but Fergus Mac-Ivor said, very
gallantly, he would never raise his hand against a grey head that was so
much respected as my fatherâ€™s.--O I wish, I wish they had continued
friends!â€™

â€˜And did you ever see this Mr. Mac-Ivor, if that be his name, Miss
Bradwardine?â€™

â€˜No, that is not his name; and he would consider MASTER as a sort of
affront, only that you are an Englishman, and know no better. But the
Lowlanders call him, like other gentlemen, by the name of his estate,
Glennaquoich; and the Highlanders call him Vich Ian Vohr, that is, the
son of John the Great; and we upon the braes here call him by both names
indifferently.â€™

â€˜I am afraid I shall never bring my English tongue to call him by either
one or other.â€™

â€˜But he is a very polite, handsome man,â€™ continued Rose; â€˜and his sister
Flora is one of the most beautiful and accomplished young ladies in this
country; she was bred in a convent in France, and was a great friend of
mine before this unhappy dispute. Dear Captain Waverley, try your
influence with my father to make matters up. I am sure this is but the
beginning of our troubles; for Tully-Veolan has never been a safe or
quiet residence when we have been at feud with the Highlanders. When I
was a girl about ten, there was a skirmish fought between a party of
twenty of them and my father and his servants behind the mains; and the
bullets broke several panes in the north windows, they were so near.
Three of the Highlanders were killed, and they brought them in wrapped in
their plaids, and laid them on the stone floor of the hall; and next
morning, their wives and daughters came, clapping their hands, and crying
the coronach, and shrieking, and carried away the dead bodies, with the
pipes playing before them. I could not sleep for six weeks without
starting and thinking I heard these terrible cries, and saw the bodies
lying on the steps, all stiff and swathed up in their bloody tartans. But
since that time there came a party from the garrison at Stirling, with a
warrant from the Lord Justice Clerk, or some such great man, and took
away all our arms; and now, how are we to protect ourselves if they come
down in any strength?â€™

Waverley could not help starting at a story which bore so much
resemblance to one of his own day-dreams. Here was a girl scarce
seventeen, the gentlest of her sex, both in temper and appearance, who
had witnessed with her own eyes such a scene as he had used to conjure up
in his imagination, as only occurring in ancient times, and spoke of it
coolly, as one very likely to recur. He felt at once the impulse of
curiosity, and that slight sense of danger which only serves to heighten
its interest. He might have said with Malvolio, â€˜â€œI do not now fool
myself, to let imagination jade me!â€ I am actually in the land of
military and romantic adventures, and it only remains to be seen what
will be my own share in them.â€™

The whole circumstances now detailed concerning the state of the country
seemed equally novel and extraordinary. He had indeed often heard of
Highland thieves, but had no idea of the systematic mode in which their
depredations were conducted; and that the practice was connived at, and
even encouraged, by many of the Highland chieftains, who not only found
the creaghs, or forays, useful for the purpose of training individuals of
their clan to the practice of arms, but also of maintaining a wholesome
terror among their Lowland neighbours, and levying, as we have seen, a
tribute from them, under colour of protection-money.

Bailie Macwheeble, who soon afterwards entered, expatiated still more at
length upon the same topic. This honest gentlemanâ€™s conversation was so
formed upon his professional practice, that Davie Gellatley once said his
discourse was like a â€˜charge of horning.â€™ He assured our hero, that â€˜from
the maist ancient times of record, the lawless thieves, limmers, and
broken men of the Highlands, had been in fellowship together by reason of
their surnames, for the committing of divers thefts, reifs, and herships
upon the honest men of the Low Country, when they not only intromitted
with their whole goods and gear, corn, cattle, horse, nolt, sheep,
outsight and insight plenishing, at their wicked pleasure, but moreover
made prisoners, ransomed them, or concussed them into giving borrows
(pledges) to enter into captivity again;--all which was directly
prohibited in divers parts of the Statute Book, both by the act one
thousand five hundred and sixty-seven, and various others; the whilk
statutes, with all that had followed and might follow thereupon, were
shamefully broken and vilipended by the said sorners, limmers, and broken
men, associated into fellowships, for the aforesaid purposes of theft,
stouthreef, fire-raising, murther, raptus mulierum, or forcible abduction
of women, and such like as aforesaid.â€™

It seemed like a dream to Waverley that these deeds of violence should be
familiar to menâ€™s minds, and currently talked of as falling within the
common order of things, and happening daily in the immediate vicinity,
without his having crossed the seas, and while he was yet in the
otherwise well-ordered island of Great Britain.




CHAPTER XVI

AN UNEXPECTED ALLY APPEARS


The Baron returned at the dinner-hour, and had in a great measure
recovered his composure and good-humour. He not only confirmed the
stories which Edward had heard from Rose and Bailie Macwheeble, but added
many anecdotes from his own experience, concerning the state of the
Highlands and their inhabitants. The chiefs he pronounced to be, in
general, gentlemen of great honour and high pedigree, whose word was
accounted as a law by all those of their own sept, or clan. â€˜It did not
indeed,â€™ he said, â€˜become them, as had occurred in late instances, to
propone their prosapia, a lineage which rested for the most part on the
vain and fond rhymes of their seannachies or bhairds, as aequiponderate
with the evidence of ancient charters and royal grants of antiquity,
conferred upon distinguished houses in the Low Country by divers Scottish
monarchs; nevertheless, such was their outrecuidance and presumption, as
to undervalue those who possessed such evidents, as if they held their
lands in a sheepâ€™s skin.â€™

This, by the way, pretty well explained the cause of quarrel between the
Baron and his Highland ally. But he went on to state so many curious
particulars concerning the manners, customs, and habits of this
patriarchal race that Edwardâ€™s curiosity became highly interested, and he
inquired whether it was possible to make with safety an excursion into
the neighbouring Highlands, whose dusky barrier of mountains had already
excited his wish to penetrate beyond them. The Baron assured his guest
that nothing would be more easy, providing this quarrel were first made
up, since he could himself give him letters to many of the distinguished
chiefs, who would receive him with the utmost courtesy and hospitality.

While they were on this topic, the door suddenly opened, and, ushered by
Saunders Saunderson, a Highlander, fully armed and equipped, entered the
apartment. Had it not been that Saunders acted the part of master of the
ceremonies to this martial apparition, without appearing to deviate from
his usual composure, and that neither Mr. Bradwardine nor Rose exhibited
any emotion, Edward would certainly have thought the intrusion hostile.
As it was, he started at the sight of what he had not yet happened to
see, a mountaineer in his full national costume. The individual Gael was
a stout, dark, young man, of low stature, the ample folds of whose plaid
added to the appearance of strength which his person exhibited. The short
kilt, or petticoat, showed his sinewy and clean-made limbs; the goatskin
purse, flanked by the usual defences, a dirk and steel-wrought pistol,
hung before him; his bonnet had a short feather, which indicated his
claim to be treated as a duinhe-wassel, or sort of gentleman; a
broadsword dangled by his side, a target hung upon his shoulder, and a
long Spanish fowling-piece occupied one of his hands. With the other hand
he pulled off his bonnet, and the Baron, who well knew their customs, and
the proper mode of addressing them, immediately said, with an air of
dignity, but without rising, and much, as Edward thought, in the manner
of a prince receiving an embassy, â€˜Welcome, Evan Dhu Maccombich; what
news from Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr?â€™

â€˜Fergus Mac-Ivor Vich Ian Vohr,â€™ said the ambassador, in good English,
â€˜greets you well, Baron of Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, and is sorry
there has been a thick cloud interposed between you and him, which has
kept you from seeing and considering the friendship and alliances that
have been between your houses and forebears of old; and he prays you that
the cloud may pass away, and that things may be as they have been
heretofore between the clan Ivor and the house of Bradwardine, when there
was an egg between them for a flint and a knife for a sword. And he
expects you will also say, you are sorry for the cloud, and no man shall
hereafter ask whether it descended from the hill to the valley, or rose
from the valley to the hill; for they never struck with the scabbard who
did not receive with the sword, and woe to him who would lose his friend
for the stormy cloud of a spring morning.â€™

To this the Baron of Bradwardine answered with suitable dignity, that he
knew the chief of Clan Ivor to be a well-wisher to the King, and he was
sorry there should have been a cloud between him and any gentleman of
such sound principles, â€˜for when folks are banding together, feeble is he
who hath no brother.â€™

This appearing perfectly satisfactory, that the peace between these
august persons might be duly solemnised, the Baron ordered a stoup of
usquebaugh, and, filling a glass, drank to the health and prosperity of
Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich; upon which the Celtic ambassador, to requite
his politeness, turned down a mighty bumper of the same generous liquor,
seasoned with his good wishes to the house of Bradwardine.

Having thus ratified the preliminaries of the general treaty of
pacification, the envoy retired to adjust with Mr. Macwheeble some
subordinate articles with which it was not thought necessary to trouble
the Baron. These probably referred to the discontinuance of the subsidy,
and apparently the Bailie found means to satisfy their ally, without
suffering his master to suppose that his dignity was compromised. At
least, it is certain, that after the plenipotentiaries had drunk a bottle
of brandy in single drams, which seemed to have no more effect upon such
seasoned vessels than if it had been poured upon the two bears at the top
of the avenue, Evan Dhu Maccombich, having possessed himself of all the
information which he could procure respecting the robbery of the
preceding night, declared his intention to set off immediately in pursuit
of the cattle, which he pronounced to be â€˜no that far off; they have
broken the bone,â€™ he observed, â€˜but they have had no time to suck the
marrow.â€™

Our hero, who had attended Evan Dhu during his perquisitions, was much
struck with the ingenuity which he displayed in collecting information,
and the precise and pointed conclusions which he drew from it. Evan Dhu,
on his part, was obviously flattered with the attention of Waverley, the
interest he seemed to take in his inquiries, and his curiosity about the
customs and scenery of the Highlands. Without much ceremony he invited
Edward to accompany him on a short walk of ten or fifteen miles into the
mountains, and see the place where the cattle were conveyed to; adding,
â€˜If it be as I suppose, you never saw such a place in your life, nor ever
will, unless you go with me or the like of me.â€™

Our hero, feeling his curiosity considerably excited by the idea of
visiting the den of a Highland Cacus, took, however, the precaution to
inquire if his guide might be trusted. He was assured that the invitation
would on no account have been given had there been the least danger, and
that all he had to apprehend was a little fatigue; and, as Evan proposed
he should pass a day at his Chieftainâ€™s house in returning, where he
would be sure of good accommodation and an excellent welcome, there
seemed nothing very formidable in the task he undertook. Rose, indeed,
turned pale when she heard of it; but her father, who loved the spirited
curiosity of his young friend, did not attempt to damp it by an alarm of
danger which really did not exist, and a knapsack, with a few
necessaries, being bound on the shoulders of a sort of deputy gamekeeper,
our hero set forth with a fowling-piece in his hand, accompanied by his
new friend Evan Dhu, and followed by the gamekeeper aforesaid, and by two
wild Highlanders, the attendants of Evan, one of whom had upon his
shoulder a hatchet at the end of a pole, called a Lochaber-axe,
[Footnote: See Note 14] and the other a long ducking-gun. Evan, upon
Edwardâ€™s inquiry, gave him to understand that this martial escort was by
no means necessary as a guard, but merely, as he said, drawing up and
adjusting his plaid with an air of dignity, that he might appear decently
at Tully-Veolan, and as Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s foster-brother ought to do. â€˜Ah!â€™
said he, â€˜if you Saxon duinhe-wassel (English gentleman) saw but the
Chief with his tail on!â€™

â€˜With his tail on?â€™ echoed Edward in some surprise.

â€˜Yes--that is, with all his usual followers, when he visits those of the
same rank. There is,â€™ he continued, stopping and drawing himself proudly
up, while he counted upon his fingers the several officers of his chiefâ€™s
retinue; â€˜there is his hanchman, or right-hand man; then his bard, or
poet; then his bladier, or orator, to make harangues to the great folks
whom he visits; then his gilly-more, or armour-bearer, to carry his sword
and target, and his gun; then his gilly-casfliuch, who carries him on his
back through the sikes and brooks; then his gilly-comstrian, to lead his
horse by the bridle in steep and difficult paths; then his
gilly-trushharnish, to carry his knapsack; and the piper and the piperâ€™s
man, and it may be a dozen young lads beside, that have no business, but
are just boys of the belt, to follow the Laird and do his honourâ€™s
bidding.â€™

â€˜And does your Chief regularly maintain all these men?â€™ demanded
Waverley.

â€˜All these?â€™ replied Evan; â€˜ay, and many a fair head beside, that would
not ken where to lay itself, but for the mickle barn at Glennaquoich.â€™

With similar tales of the grandeur of the Chief in peace and war, Evan
Dhu beguiled the way till they approached more closely those huge
mountains which Edward had hitherto only seen at a distance. It was
towards evening as they entered one of the tremendous passes which afford
communication between the high and low country; the path, which was
extremely steep and rugged, winded up a chasm between two tremendous
rocks, following the passage which a foaming stream, that brawled far
below, appeared to have worn for itself in the course of ages. A few
slanting beams of the sun, which was now setting, reached the water in
its darksome bed, and showed it partially, chafed by a hundred rocks and
broken by a hundred falls. The descent from the path to the stream was a
mere precipice, with here and there a projecting fragment of granite, or
a scathed tree, which had warped its twisted roots into the fissures of
the rock. On the right hand, the mountain rose above the path with almost
equal inaccessibility; but the hill on the opposite side displayed a
shroud of copsewood, with which some pines were intermingled.

â€˜This,â€™ said Evan, â€˜is the pass of Bally-Brough, which was kept in former
times by ten of the clan Donnochie against a hundred of the Low-Country
carles. The graves of the slain are still to be seen in that little
corrie, or bottom, on the opposite side of the burn; if your eyes are
good, you may see the green specks among the heather. See, there is an
earn, which you Southrons call an eagle. You have no such birds as that
in England. He is going to fetch his supper from the Laird of
Bradwardineâ€™s braes, but I â€˜ll send a slug after him.â€™

He fired his piece accordingly, but missed the superb monarch of the
feathered tribes, who, without noticing the attempt to annoy him,
continued his majestic flight to the southward. A thousand birds of prey,
hawks, kites, carrion-crows, and ravens, disturbed from the lodgings
which they had just taken up for the evening, rose at the report of the
gun, and mingled their hoarse and discordant notes with the echoes which
replied to it, and with the roar of the mountain cataracts. Evan, a
little disconcerted at having missed his mark, when he meant to have
displayed peculiar dexterity, covered his confusion by whistling part of
a pibroch as he reloaded his piece, and proceeded in silence up the pass.

It issued in a narrow glen, between two mountains, both very lofty and
covered with heath. The brook continued to be their companion, and they
advanced up its mazes, crossing them now and then, on which occasions
Evan Dhu uniformly offered the assistance of his attendants to carry over
Edward; but our hero, who had been always a tolerable pedestrian,
declined the accommodation, and obviously rose in his guideâ€™s opinion, by
showing that he did not fear wetting his feet. Indeed he was anxious, so
far as he could without affectation, to remove the opinion which Evan
seemed to entertain of the effeminacy of the Lowlanders, and particularly
of the English.

Through the gorge of this glen they found access to a black bog, of
tremendous extent, full of large pit-holes, which they traversed with
great difficulty and some danger, by tracks which no one but a Highlander
could have followed. The path itself, or rather the portion of more solid
ground on which the travellers half walked, half waded, was rough,
broken, and in many places quaggy and unsound. Sometimes the ground was
so completely unsafe that it was necessary to spring from one hillock to
another, the space between being incapable of bearing the human weight.
This was an easy matter to the Highlanders, who wore thin-soled brogues
fit for the purpose, and moved with a peculiar springing step; but Edward
began to find the exercise, to which he was unaccustomed, more fatiguing
than he expected. The lingering twilight served to show them through this
Serbonian bog, but deserted them almost totally at the bottom of a steep
and very stony hill, which it was the travellersâ€™ next toilsome task to
ascend. The night, however, was pleasant, and not dark; and Waverley,
calling up mental energy to support personal fatigue, held on his march
gallantly, though envying in his heart his Highland attendants, who
continued, without a symptom of abated vigour, the rapid and swinging
pace, or rather trot, which, according to his computation, had already
brought them fifteen miles upon their journey.

After crossing this mountain and descending on the other side towards a
thick wood, Evan Dhu held some conference with his Highland attendants,
in consequence of which Edwardâ€™s baggage was shifted from the shoulders
of the gamekeeper to those of one of the gillies, and the former was sent
off with the other mountaineer in a direction different from that of the
three remaining travellers. On asking the meaning of this separation,
Waverley was told that the Lowlander must go to a hamlet about three
miles off for the night; for unless it was some very particular friend,
Donald Bean Lean, the worthy person whom they supposed to be possessed of
the cattle, did not much approve of strangers approaching his retreat.
This seemed reasonable, and silenced a qualm of suspicion which came
across Edwardâ€™s mind when he saw himself, at such a place and such an
hour, deprived of his only Lowland companion. And Evan immediately
afterwards added, â€˜that indeed he himself had better get forward, and
announce their approach to Donald Bean Lean, as the arrival of a sidier
roy (red soldier) might otherwise be a disagreeable surprise.â€™ And
without waiting for an answer, in jockey phrase, he trotted out, and
putting himself to a very round pace, was out of sight in an instant.

Waverley was now left to his own meditations, for his attendant with the
battle-axe spoke very little English. They were traversing a thick, and,
as it seemed, an endless wood of pines, and consequently the path was
altogether indiscernible in the murky darkness which surrounded them. The
Highlander, however, seemed to trace it by instinct, without the
hesitation of a moment, and Edward followed his footsteps as close as he
could.

After journeying a considerable time in silence, he could not help
asking, â€˜Was it far to the end of their journey?â€™

â€˜Ta cove was tree, four mile; but as duinhe-wassel was a wee taiglit,
Donald could, tat is, might--would--should send ta curragh.â€™

This conveyed no information. The curragh which was promised might be a
man, a horse, a cart, or chaise; and no more could be got from the man
with the battle-axe but a repetition of â€˜Aich ay! ta curragh.â€™

But in a short time Edward began to conceive his meaning, when, issuing
from the wood, he found himself on the banks of a large river or lake,
where his conductor gave him to understand they must sit down for a
little while. The moon, which now began to rise, showed obscurely the
expanse of water which spread before them, and the shapeless and
indistinct forms of mountains with which it seemed to be surrounded. The
cool and yet mild air of the summer night refreshed Waverley after his
rapid and toilsome walk; and the perfume which it wafted from the birch
trees, [Footnote: It is not the weeping birch, the most common species in
the Highlands, but the woolly-leaved Lowland birch, that is distinguished
by this fragrance.] bathed in the evening dew, was exquisitely fragrant.

He had now time to give himself up to the full romance of his situation.
Here he sate on the banks of an unknown lake, under the guidance of a
wild native, whose language was unknown to him, on a visit to the den of
some renowned outlaw, a second Robin Hood, perhaps, or Adam oâ€™ Gordon,
and that at deep midnight, through scenes of difficulty and toil,
separated from his attendant, left by his guide. What a variety of
incidents for the exercise of a romantic imagination, and all enhanced by
the solemn feeling of uncertainty at least, if not of danger! The only
circumstance which assorted ill with the rest was the cause of his
journey--the Baronâ€™s milk-cows! this degrading incident he kept in the
background.

While wrapt in these dreams of imagination, his companion gently touched
him, and, pointing in a direction nearly straight across the lake, said,
â€˜Yonâ€™s ta cove.â€™ A small point of light was seen to twinkle in the
direction in which he pointed, and, gradually increasing in size and
lustre, seemed to flicker like a meteor upon the verge of the horizon.
While Edward watched this phenomenon, the distant dash of oars was heard.
The measured sound approached near and more near, and presently a loud
whistle was heard in the same direction. His friend with the battle-axe
immediately whistled clear and shrill, in reply to the signal, and a
boat, manned with four or five Highlanders, pushed for a little inlet,
near which Edward was sitting. He advanced to meet them with his
attendant, was immediately assisted into the boat by the officious
attention of two stout mountaineers, and had no sooner seated himself
than they resumed their oars, and began to row across the lake with great
rapidity.




CHAPTER XVII

THE HOLD OF A HIGHLAND ROBBER


The party preserved silence, interrupted only by the monotonous and
murmured chant of a Gaelic song, sung in a kind of low recitative by the
steersman, and by the dash of the oars, which the notes seemed to
regulate, as they dipped to them in cadence. The light, which they now
approached more nearly, assumed a broader, redder and more irregular
splendour. It appeared plainly to be a large fire, but whether kindled
upon an island or the mainland Edward could not determine. As he saw it,
the red glaring orb seemed to rest on the very surface of the lake
itself, and resembled the fiery vehicle in which the Evil Genius of an
Oriental tale traverses land and sea. They approached nearer, and the
light of the fire sufficed to show that it was kindled at the bottom of a
huge dark crag or rock, rising abruptly from the very edge of the water;
its front, changed by the reflection to dusky red, formed a strange and
even awful contrast to the banks around, which were from time to time
faintly and partially illuminated by pallid moonlight.

The boat now neared the shore, and Edward could discover that this large
fire, amply supplied with branches of pine-wood by two figures, who, in
the red reflection of its light, appeared like demons, was kindled in the
jaws of a lofty cavern, into which an inlet from the lake seemed to
advance; and he conjectured, which was indeed true, that the fire had
been lighted as a beacon to the boatmen on their return. They rowed right
for the mouth of the cave, and then, shifting their oars, permitted the
boat to enter in obedience to the impulse which it had received. The
skiff passed the little point or platform of rock on which the fire was
blazing, and running about two boatsâ€™ lengths farther, stopped where the
cavern (for it was already arched overhead) ascended from the water by
five or six broad ledges of rock, so easy and regular that they might be
termed natural steps. At this moment a quantity of water was suddenly
flung upon the fire, which sunk with a hissing noise, and with it
disappeared the light it had hitherto afforded. Four or five active arms
lifted Waverley out of the boat, placed him on his feet, and almost
carried him into the recesses of the cave. He made a few paces in
darkness, guided in this manner; and advancing towards a hum of voices,
which seemed to sound from the centre of the rock, at an acute turn
Donald Bean Lean and his whole establishment were before his eyes.





The interior of the cave, which here rose very high, was illuminated by
torches made of pine-tree, which emitted a bright and bickering light,
attended by a strong though not unpleasant odour. Their light was
assisted by the red glare of a large charcoal fire, round which were
seated five or six armed Highlanders, while others were indistinctly seen
couched on their plaids in the more remote recesses of the cavern. In one
large aperture, which the robber facetiously called his SPENCE (or
pantry), there hung by the heels the carcasses of a sheep, or ewe, and
two cows lately slaughtered. The principal inhabitant of this singular
mansion, attended by Evan Dhu as master of the ceremonies, came forward
to meet his guest, totally different in appearance and manner from what
his imagination had anticipated. The profession which he followed, the
wilderness in which he dwelt, the wild warrior forms that surrounded him,
were all calculated to inspire terror. From such accompaniments, Waverley
prepared himself to meet a stern, gigantic, ferocious figure, such as
Salvator would have chosen to be the central object of a group of
banditti. [Footnote: See Note 15.]

Donald Bean Lean was the very reverse of all these. He was thin in person
and low in stature, with light sandy-coloured hair, and small pale
features, from which he derived his agnomen of BEAN or white; and
although his form was light, well proportioned and active, he appeared,
on the whole, rather a diminutive and insignificant figure. He had served
in some inferior capacity in the French army, and in order to receive his
English visitor in great form, and probably meaning, in his way, to pay
him a compliment, he had laid aside the Highland dress for the time, to
put on an old blue and red uniform and a feathered hat, in which he was
far from showing to advantage, and indeed looked so incongruous, compared
with all around him, that Waverley would have been tempted to laugh, had
laughter been either civil or safe. The robber received Captain Waverley
with a profusion of French politeness and Scottish hospitality, seemed
perfectly to know his name and connections, and to be particularly
acquainted with his uncleâ€™s political principles. On these he bestowed
great applause, to which Waverley judged it prudent to make a very
general reply.

Being placed at a convenient distance from the charcoal fire, the heat of
which the season rendered oppressive, a strapping Highland damsel placed
before Waverley, Evan, and Donald Bean three cogues, or wooden vessels
composed of staves and hoops, containing eanaruich, [Footnote: This was
the regale presented by Rob Roy to the Laird of Tullibody.] a sort of
strong soup, made out of a particular part of the inside of the beeves.
After this refreshment, which, though coarse, fatigue and hunger rendered
palatable, steaks, roasted on the coals, were supplied in liberal
abundance, and disappeared before Evan Dhu and their host with a
promptitude that seemed like magic, and astonished Waverley, who was much
puzzled to reconcile their voracity with what he had heard of the
abstemiousness of the Highlanders. He was ignorant that this abstinence
was with the lower ranks wholly compulsory, and that, like some animals
of prey, those who practise it were usually gifted with the power of
indemnifying themselves to good purpose when chance threw plenty in their
way. The whisky came forth in abundance to crown the cheer. The
Highlanders drank it copiously and undiluted; but Edward, having mixed a
little with water, did not find it so palatable as to invite him to
repeat the draught. Their host bewailed himself exceedingly that he could
offer him no wine: â€˜Had he but known four-and-twenty hours before, he
would have had some, had it been within the circle of forty miles round
him. But no gentleman could do more to show his sense of the honour of a
visit from another than to offer him the best cheer his house afforded.
Where there are no bushes there can be no nuts, and the way of those you
live with is that you must follow,â€™

He went on regretting to Evan Dhu the death of an aged man, Donnacha an
Amrigh, or Duncan with the Cap, â€˜a gifted seer,â€™ who foretold, through
the second sight, visitors of every description who haunted their
dwelling, whether as friends or foes.

â€˜Is not his son Malcolm taishatr (a second-sighted person)?â€™ asked Evan.

â€˜Nothing equal to his father,â€™ replied Donald Bean. â€˜He told us the other
day, we were to see a great gentleman riding on a horse, and there came
nobody that whole day but Shemus Beg, the blind harper, with his dog.
Another time he advertised us of a wedding, and behold it proved a
funeral; and on the creagh, when he foretold to us we should bring home a
hundred head of horned cattle, we gripped nothing but a fat bailie of
Perth.â€™

From this discourse he passed to the political and military state of the
country; and Waverley was astonished, and even alarmed, to find a person
of this description so accurately acquainted with the strength of the
various garrisons and regiments quartered north of the Tay. He even
mentioned the exact number of recruits who had joined Waverleyâ€™s troop
from his uncleâ€™s estate, and observed they were PRETTY MEN, meaning, not
handsome, but stout warlike fellows. He put Waverley in mind of one or
two minute circumstances which had happened at a general review of the
regiment, which satisfied him that the robber had been an eye-witness of
it; and Evan Dhu having by this time retired from the conversation, and
wrapped himself up in his plaid to take some repose, Donald asked Edward,
in a very significant manner, whether he had nothing particular to say to
him.

Waverley, surprised and somewhat startled at this question from such a
character, answered, he had no motive in visiting him but curiosity to
see his extraordinary place of residence. Donald Bean Lean looked him
steadily in the face for an instant, and then said, with a significant
nod, â€˜You might as well have confided in me; I am as much worthy of trust
as either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr. But you are equally
welcome to my house.â€™

Waverley felt an involuntary shudder creep over him at the mysterious
language held by this outlawed and lawless bandit, which, in despite of
his attempts to master it, deprived him of the power to ask the meaning
of his insinuations. A heath pallet, with the flowers stuck uppermost,
had been prepared for him in a recess of the cave, and here, covered with
such spare plaids as could be mustered, he lay for some time watching the
motions of the other inhabitants of the cavern. Small parties of two or
three entered or left the place, without any other ceremony than a few
words in Gaelic to the principal outlaw, and, when he fell asleep, to a
tall Highlander who acted as his lieutenant, and seemed to keep watch
during his repose. Those who entered seemed to have returned from some
excursion, of which they reported the success, and went without farther
ceremony to the larder, where, cutting with their dirks their rations
from the carcasses which were there suspended, they proceeded to broil
and eat them at their own pleasure and leisure. The liquor was under
strict regulation, being served out either by Donald himself, his
lieutenant, or the strapping Highland girl aforesaid, who was the only
female that appeared. The allowance of whisky, however, would have
appeared prodigal to any but Highlanders, who, living entirely in the
open air and in a very moist climate, can consume great quantities of
ardent spirits without the usual baneful effects either upon the brain or
constitution.

At length the fluctuating groups began to swim before the eyes of our
hero as they gradually closed; nor did he re-open them till the morning
sun was high on the lake without, though there was but a faint and
glimmering twilight in the recesses of Uaimh an Ri, or the Kingâ€™s Cavern,
as the abode of Donald Bean Lean was proudly denominated.




CHAPTER XVIII

WAVERLEY PROCEEDS ON HIS JOURNEY


When Edward had collected his scattered recollection, he was surprised to
observe the cavern totally deserted. Having arisen and put his dress in
some order, he looked more accurately round him; but all was still
solitary. If it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire, now sunk
into grey ashes, and the remnants of the festival, consisting of bones
half burnt and half gnawed, and an empty keg or two, there remained no
traces of Donald and his band. When Waverley sallied forth to the
entrance of the cave, he perceived that the point of rock, on which
remained the marks of last nightâ€™s beacon, was accessible by a small
path, either natural or roughly hewn in the rock, along the little inlet
of water which ran a few yards up into the cavern, where, as in a
wetdock, the skiff which brought him there the night before was still
lying moored. When he reached the small projecting platform on which the
beacon had been established, he would have believed his further progress
by land impossible, only that it was scarce probable but what the
inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it otherwise than
by the lake. Accordingly, he soon observed three or four shelving steps,
or ledges of rock, at the very extremity of the little platform; and,
making use of them as a staircase, he clambered by their means around the
projecting shoulder of the crag on which the cavern opened, and,
descending with some difficulty on the other side, he gained the wild and
precipitous shores of a Highland loch, about four miles in length and a
mile and a half across, surrounded by heathy and savage mountains, on the
crests of which the morning mist was still sleeping.

Looking back to the place from which he came, he could not help admiring
the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and secrecy.
The rock, round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few
imperceptible notches, that barely afforded place for the foot, seemed,
in looking back upon it, a huge precipice, which barred all further
passage by the shores of the lake in that direction. There could be no
possibility, the breadth of the lake considered, of descrying the
entrance of the narrow and low-browed cave from the other side; so that,
unless the retreat had been sought for with boats, or disclosed by
treachery, it might be a safe and secret residence to its garrison as
long as they were supplied with provisions. Having satisfied his
curiosity in these particulars, Waverley looked around for Evan Dhu and
his attendants, who, he rightly judged, would be at no great distance,
whatever might have become of Donald Bean Lean and his party, whose mode
of life was, of course, liable to sudden migrations of abode.
Accordingly, at the distance of about half a mile, he beheld a Highlander
(Evan apparently) angling in the lake, with another attending him, whom,
from the weapon which he shouldered, he recognised for his friend with
the battle-axe.

Much nearer to the mouth of the cave he heard the notes of a lively
Gaelic song, guided by which, in a sunny recess, shaded by a glittering
birch-tree, and carpeted with a bank of firm white sand, he found the
damsel of the cavern, whose lay had already reached him, busy, to the
best of her power, in arranging to advantage a morning repast of milk,
eggs, barley-bread, fresh butter, and honey-comb. The poor girl had
already made a circuit of four miles that morning in search of the eggs,
of the meal which baked her cakes, and of the other materials of the
breakfast, being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from
distant cottagers. The followers of Donald Bean Lean used little food
except the flesh of the animals which they drove away from the Lowlands;
bread itself was a delicacy seldom thought of, because hard to be
obtained, and all the domestic accommodations of milk, poultry, butter,
etc., were out of the question in this Scythian camp. Yet it must not be
omitted that, although Alice had occupied a part of the morning in
providing those accommodations for her guest which the cavern did not
afford, she had secured time also to arrange her own person in her best
trim. Her finery was very simple. A short russet-coloured jacket and a
petticoat of scanty longitude was her whole dress; but these were clean,
and neatly arranged. A piece of scarlet embroidered cloth, called the
snood, confined her hair, which fell over it in a profusion of rich dark
curls. The scarlet plaid, which formed part of her dress, was laid aside,
that it might not impede her activity in attending the stranger. I should
forget Aliceâ€™s proudest ornament were I to omit mentioning a pair of gold
ear-rings and a golden rosary, which her father (for she was the
daughter of Donald Bean Lean) had brought from France, the plunder,
probably, of some battle or storm.

Her form, though rather large for her years, was very well proportioned,
and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace, with nothing of the
sheepishness of an ordinary peasant. The smiles, displaying a row of
teeth of exquisite whiteness, and the laughing eyes, with which, in dumb
show, she gave Waverley that morning greeting which she wanted English
words to express, might have been interpreted by a coxcomb, or perhaps by
a young soldier who, without being such, was conscious of a handsome
person, as meant to convey more than the courtesy of an hostess. Nor do I
take it upon me to say that the little wild mountaineer would have
welcomed any staid old gentleman advanced in life, the Baron of
Bradwardine, for example, with the cheerful pains which she bestowed upon
Edwardâ€™s accommodation. She seemed eager to place him by the meal which
she had so sedulously arranged, and to which she now added a few bunches
of cranberries, gathered in an adjacent morass. Having had the
satisfaction of seeing him seated at his breakfast, she placed herself
demurely upon a stone at a few yardsâ€™ distance, and appeared to watch
with great complacency for some opportunity of serving him.

Evan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach, the latter
bearing a large salmon-trout, the produce of the morningâ€™s sport,
together with the angling-rod, while Evan strolled forward, with an easy,
self-satisfied, and important gait, towards the spot where Waverley was
so agreeably employed at the breakfast-table. After morning greetings had
passed on both sides, and Evan, looking at Waverley, had said something
in Gaelic to Alice, which made her laugh, yet colour up to her eyes,
through a complexion well en-browned by sun and wind, Evan intimated his
commands that the fish should be prepared for breakfast. A spark from the
lock of his pistol produced a light, and a few withered fir branches were
quickly in flame, and as speedily reduced to hot embers, on which the
trout was broiled in large slices. To crown the repast, Evan produced
from the pocket of his short jerkin a large scallop shell, and from under
the folds of his plaid a ramâ€™s horn full of whisky. Of this he took a
copious dram, observing he had already taken his MORNING with Donald Bean
Lean before his departure; he offered the same cordial to Alice and to
Edward, which they both declined. With the bounteous air of a lord, Evan
then proffered the scallop to Dugald Mahony, his attendant, who, without
waiting to be asked a second time, drank it off with great gusto. Evan
then prepared to move towards the boat, inviting Waverley to attend him.
Meanwhile, Alice had made up in a small basket what she thought worth
removing, and flinging her plaid around her, she advanced up to Edward,
and with the utmost simplicity, taking hold of his hand, offered her
cheek to his salute, dropping at the same time her little curtsy. Evan,
who was esteemed a wag among the mountain fair, advanced as if to secure
a similar favour; but Alice, snatching up her basket, escaped up the
rocky bank as fleetly as a roe, and, turning round and laughing, called
something out to him in Gaelic, which he answered in the same tone and
language; then, waving her hand to Edward, she resumed her road, and was
soon lost among the thickets, though they continued for some time to hear
her lively carol, as she proceeded gaily on her solitary journey.

They now again entered the gorge of the cavern, and stepping into the
boat, the Highlander pushed off, and, taking advantage of the morning
breeze, hoisted a clumsy sort of sail, while Evan assumed the helm,
directing their course, as it appeared to Waverley, rather higher up the
lake than towards the place of his embarkation on the preceding night. As
they glided along the silver mirror, Evan opened the conversation with a
panegyric upon Alice, who, he said, was both CANNY and FENDY; and was, to
the boot of all that, the best dancer of a strathspey in the whole
strath. Edward assented to her praises so far as he understood them, yet
could not help regretting that she was condemned to such a perilous and
dismal life.

â€˜Oich! for that,â€™ said Evan, â€˜there is nothing in Perthshire that she
need want, if she ask her father to fetch it, unless it be too hot or too
heavy.â€™

â€˜But to be the daughter of a cattle-stealer--a common thief!â€™ â€˜Common
thief!--no such thing: Donald Bean Lean never LIFTED less than a drove in
his life.â€™

â€˜Do you call him an uncommon thief, then?â€™

â€˜No; he that steals a cow from a poor widow, or a stirk from a cotter, is
a thief; he that lifts a drove from a Sassenach laird is a
gentleman-drover. And, besides, to take a tree from the forest, a salmon
from the river, a deer from the hill, or a cow from a Lowland strath, is
what no Highlander need ever think shame upon.â€™

â€˜But what can this end in, were he taken in such an appropriation?â€™

â€˜To be sure he would DIE FOR THE LAW, as many a pretty man has done
before him.â€™

â€˜Die for the law!â€™

â€˜Ay; that is, with the law, or by the law; be strapped up on the KIND
gallows of Crieff, [Footnote: See Note 16.] where his father died, and
his goodsire died, and where I hope heâ€™ll live to die himsell, if heâ€™s
not shot, or slashed, in a creagh.â€™

â€˜You HOPE such a death for your friend, Evan?â€™

â€˜And that do I eâ€™en; would you have me wish him to die on a bundle of wet
straw in yon den of his, like a mangy tyke?â€™

â€˜But what becomes of Alice, then?â€™

â€˜Troth, if such an accident were to happen, as her father would not need
her help ony langer, I ken nought to hinder me to marry her mysell.â€™

â€˜Gallantly resolved,â€™ said Edward; â€˜but, in the meanwhile, Evan, what has
your father-in-law (that shall be, if he have the good fortune to be
hanged) done with the Baronâ€™s cattle?â€™

â€˜Oich,â€™ answered Evan, â€˜they were all trudging before your lad and Allan
Kennedy before the sun blinked ower Ben Lawers this morning; and theyâ€™ll
be in the pass of Bally-Brough by this time, in their way back to the
parks of Tully-Veolan, all but two, that were unhappily slaughtered
before I got last night to Uaimh an Ri.â€™

â€˜And where are we going, Evan, if I may be so bold as to ask?â€™ said
Waverley.

â€˜Where would you be ganging, but to the Lairdâ€™s ain house of
Glennaquoich? Ye would not think to be in his country, without ganging to
see him? It would be as much as a manâ€™s lifeâ€™s worth.â€™

â€˜And are we far from Glennaquoich?â€™

â€˜But five bits of miles; and Vich Ian Vohr will meet us.â€™

In about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake, where,
after landing Waverley, the two Highanders drew the boat into a little
creek among thick flags and reeds, where it lay perfectly concealed. The
oars they put in another place of concealment, both for the use of Donald
Bean Lean probably, when his occasions should next bring him to that
place.

The travellers followed for some time a delightful opening into the
hills, down which a little brook found its way to the lake. When they had
pursued their walk a short distance, Waverley renewed his questions about
their host of the cavern.

â€˜Does he always reside in that cave?â€™

â€˜Out, no! itâ€™s past the skill of man to tell where heâ€™s to be found at aâ€™
times; thereâ€™s not a dern nook, or cove, or corrie, in the whole country
that heâ€™s not acquainted with.â€™

â€˜And do others beside your master shelter him?â€™

â€˜My master? MY master is in Heaven,â€™ answered Evan, haughtily; and then
immediately assuming his usual civility of manner, â€˜but you mean my
Chief;--no, he does not shelter Donald Bean Lean, nor any that are like
him; he only allows him (with a smile) wood and water.â€™

â€˜No great boon, I should think, Evan, when both seem to be very plenty.â€™

â€˜Ah! but ye dinna see through it. When I say wood and water, I mean the
loch and the land; and I fancy Donald would be put till â€˜t if the Laird
were to look for him wiâ€™ threescore men in the wood of Kailychat yonder;
and if our boats, with a score or twa mair, were to come down the loch to
Uaimh an Ri, headed by mysell, or ony other pretty man.â€™

â€˜But suppose a strong party came against him from the Low Country, would
not your Chief defend him?â€™

â€˜Na, he would not ware the spark of a flint for him--if they came with
the law.â€™

â€˜And what must Donald do, then?â€™

â€˜He behoved to rid this country of himsell, and fall back, it may be,
over the mount upon Letter Scriven.â€™

â€˜And if he were pursued to that place?â€™

â€˜Iâ€™se warrant he would go to his cousinâ€™s at Rannoch.â€™

â€˜Well, but if they followed him to Rannoch?â€™

â€˜That,â€™ quoth Evan, â€˜is beyond all belief; and, indeed, to tell you the
truth, there durst not a Lowlander in all Scotland follow the fray a
gun-shot beyond Bally-Brough, unless he had the help of the Sidier Dhu.â€™

â€˜Whom do you call so?â€™

â€˜The Sidier Dhu? the black soldier; that is what they call the
independent companies that were raised to keep peace and law in the
Highlands. Vich Ian Vohr commanded one of them for five years, and I was
sergeant mysell, I shall warrant ye. They call them Sidier Dhu because
they wear the tartans, as they call your men--King Georgeâ€™s men--Sidier
Roy, or red soldiers.â€™

â€˜Well, but when you were in King Georgeâ€™s pay, Evan, you were surely King
Georgeâ€™s soldiers?â€™

â€˜Troth, and you must ask Vich Ian Vohr about that; for we are for his
king, and care not much which oâ€™ them it is. At ony rate, nobody can say
we are King Georgeâ€™s men now, when we have not seen his pay this
twelve-month.â€™

This last argument admitted of no reply, nor did Edward attempt any; he
rather chose to bring back the discourse to Donald Bean Lean. â€˜Does
Donald confine himself to cattle, or does he LIFT, as you call it,
anything else that comes in his way?â€™

â€˜Troth, heâ€™s nae nice body, and heâ€™ll just tak onything, but most readily
cattle, horse, or live Christians; for sheep are slow of travel, and
inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry, and not easy to put away for
siller in this country.â€™

â€˜But does he carry off men and women?â€™

â€˜Out, ay. Did not ye hear him speak oâ€™ the Perth bailie? It cost that
body five hundred merks ere he got to the south of Bally-Brough. And ance
Donald played a pretty sport. [Footnote: See Note 17.] There was to be a
blythe bridal between the Lady Cramfeezer, in the howe oâ€™ the Mearns (she
was the auld lairdâ€™s widow, and no sae young as she had been hersell),
and young Gilliewhackit, who had spent his heirship and movables, like a
gentleman, at cock-matches, bull-baitings, horse-races, and the like.
Now, Donald Bean Lean, being aware that the bridegroom was in request,
and wanting to cleik the cunzie (that is, to hook the siller), he cannily
carried off Gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding dovering hame (wiâ€™
the malt rather abune the meal), and with the help of his gillies he gat
him into the hills with the speed of light, and the first place he
wakened in was the cove of Uaimh an Ri. So there was old to do about
ransoming the bridegroom; for Donald would not lower a farthing of a
thousand punds--â€™

â€˜The devil!â€™

â€˜Punds Scottish, ye shall understand. And the lady had not the siller if
she had pawned her gown; and they applied to the governor oâ€™ Stirling
castle, and to the major oâ€™ the Black Watch; and the governor said it was
ower far to the northward, and out of his district; and the major said
his men were gane hame to the shearing, and he would not call them out
before the victual was got in for all the Cramfeezers in Christendom, let
alane the Mearns, for that it would prejudice the country. And in the
meanwhile yeâ€™ll no hinder Gilliewhackit to take the small-pox. There was
not the doctor in Perth or Stirling would look near the poor lad; and I
cannot blame them, for Donald had been misguggled by ane of these doctors
about Paris, and he swore he would fling the first into the loch that he
catched beyond the pass. However some cailliachs (that is, old women)
that were about Donaldâ€™s hand nursed Gilliewhackit sae weel that, between
the free open air in the cove and the fresh whey, deil an he did not
recover maybe as weel as if he had been closed in a glazed chamber and a
bed with curtains, and fed with red wine and white meat. And Donald was
sae vexed about it that, when he was stout and weel, he even sent him
free home, and said he would be pleased with onything they would like to
gie him for the plague and trouble which he had about Gilliewhackit to an
unkennâ€™d degree. And I cannot tell you precisely how they sorted; but
they agreed sae right that Donald was invited to dance at the wedding in
his Highland trews, and they said that there was never sae meikle siller
clinked in his purse either before or since. And to the boot of all that,
Gilliewhackit said that, be the evidence what it liked, if he had the
luck to be on Donaldâ€™s inquest, he would bring him in guilty of nothing
whatever, unless it were wilful arson or murder under trust.â€™

With such bald and disjointed chat Evan went on illustrating the existing
state of the Highlands, more perhaps to the amusement of Waverley than
that of our readers. At length, after having marched over bank and brae,
moss and heather, Edward, though not unacquainted with the Scottish
liberality in computing distance, began to think that Evanâ€™s five miles
were nearly doubled. His observation on the large measure which the
Scottish allowed of their land, in comparison to the computation of their
money, was readily answered by Evan with the old jest, â€˜The deil take
them wha have the least pint stoup.â€™

[Footnote: The Scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor; the
Scottish pint corresponds to two English quarts. As for their coin, every
one knows the couplet--

         How can the rogues pretend to sense?
         Their pound is only twenty pence.]

And now the report of a gun was heard, and a sportsman was seen, with his
dogs and attendant, at the upper end of the glen. â€˜Shough,â€™ said Dugald
Mahony, â€˜tatâ€™s ta Chief.â€™

â€˜It is not,â€™ said Evan, imperiously. â€˜Do you think he would come to meet
a Sassenach duinhe-wassel in such a way as that?â€™

But as they approached a little nearer, he said, with an appearance of
mortification, â€˜And it is even he, sure enough; and he has not his tail
on after all; there is no living creature with him but Callum Beg.â€™

In fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman might have said as truly as
of any man in the Highlands, â€˜Quâ€™il connoit bien ses gensâ€™ had no idea of
raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune by
appearing with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the
occasion. He was well aware that such an unnecessary attendance would
seem to Edward rather ludicrous than respectable; and, while few men were
more attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power, he was, for
that very reason, cautious of exhibiting external marks of dignity,
unless at the time and in the manner when they were most likely to
produce an imposing effect. Therefore, although, had he been to receive a
brother chieftain, he would probably have been attended by all that
retinue which Evan described with so much unction, he judged it more
respectable to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very
handsome Highland boy, who carried his masterâ€™s shooting-pouch and his
broadsword, without which he seldom went abroad.

When Fergus and Waverley met, the latter was struck with the peculiar
grace and dignity of the Chieftainâ€™s figure. Above the middle size and
finely proportioned, the Highland dress, which he wore in its simplest
mode, set off his person to great advantage. He wore the trews, or close
trowsers, made of tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other particulars
his dress strictly resembled Evanâ€™s, excepting that he had no weapon save
a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we have said,
carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held in his hand,
seemed only designed for sport. He had shot in the course of his walk
some young wild-ducks, as, though CLOSE TIME was then unknown, the broods
of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman. His countenance was
decidedly Scottish, with all the peculiarities of the northern
physiognomy, but yet had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that
it would have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome. The
martial air of the bonnet, with a single eagleâ€™s feather as a
distinction, added much to the manly appearance of his head, which was
besides ornamented with a far more natural and graceful cluster of close
black curls than ever were exposed to sale in Bond Street.

An air of openness and affability increased the favorable impression
derived from this handsome and dignified exterior. Yet a skilful
physiognomist would have been less satisfied with the countenance on the
second than on the first view. The eyebrow and upper lip bespoke
something of the habit of peremptory command and decisive superiority.
Even his courtesy, though open, frank, and unconstrained, seemed to
indicate a sense of personal importance; and, upon any check or
accidental excitation, a sudden, though transient lour of the eye showed
a hasty, haughty, and vindictive temper, not less to be dreaded because
it seemed much under its ownerâ€™s command. In short, the countenance of
the Chieftain resembled a smiling summerâ€™s day, in which,
notwithstanding, we are made sensible by certain, though slight signs
that it may thunder and lighten before the close of evening.

It was not, however, upon their first meeting that Edward had an
opportunity of making these less favourable remarks. The Chief received
him as a friend of the Baron of Bradwardine, with the utmost expression
of kindness and obligation for the visit; upbraided him gently with
choosing so rude an abode as he had done the night before; and entered
into a lively conversation with him about Donald Beanâ€™s housekeeping, but
without the least hint as to his predatory habits, or the immediate
occasion of Waverleyâ€™s visit, a topic which, as the Chief did not
introduce it, our hero also avoided. While they walked merrily on towards
the house of Glennaquoich, Evan, who now fell respectfully into the rear,
followed with Callum Beg and Dugald Mahony.

We shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to some particulars
of Fergus Mac-Ivorâ€™s character and history, which were not completely
known to Waverley till after a connection which, though arising from a
circumstance so casual, had for a length of time the deepest influence
upon his character, actions, and prospects. But this, being an important
subject, must form the commencement of a new chapter.




CHAPTER XIX

THE CHIEF AND HIS MANSION


The ingenious licentiate Francisco de Ubeda, when he commenced his
history of â€˜La Picara Justina Diez,â€™--which, by the way, is one of the
most rare books of Spanish literature,--complained of his pen having
caught up a hair, and forthwith begins, with more eloquence than common
sense, an affectionate expostulation with that useful implement,
upbraiding it with being the quill of a goose,--a bird inconstant by
nature, as frequenting the three elements of water, earth, and air
indifferently, and being, of course, â€˜to one thing constant never.â€™ Now I
protest to thee, gentle reader, that I entirely dissent from Francisco de
Ubeda in this matter, and hold it the most useful quality of my pen, that
it can speedily change from grave to gay, and from description and
dialogue to narrative and character. So that if my quill display no other
properties of its mother-goose than her mutability, truly I shall be well
pleased; and I conceive that you, my worthy friend, will have no occasion
for discontent. From the jargon, therefore, of the Highland gillies I
pass to the character of their Chief. It is an important examination, and
therefore, like Dogberry, we must spare no wisdom.

The ancestor of Fergus Mac-Ivor, about three centuries before, had set up
a claim to be recognised as chief of the numerous and powerful clan to
which he belonged, the name of which it is unnecessary to mention. Being
defeated by an opponent who had more justice, or at least more force, on
his side, he moved southwards, with those who adhered to him, in quest of
new settlements, like a second &AElig;neas. The state of the Perthshire
Highlands favoured his purpose. A great baron in that country had lately
become traitor to the crown; Ian, which was the name of our adventurer,
united himself with those who were commissioned by the king to chastise
him, and did such good service that he obtained a grant of the property,
upon which he and his posterity afterwards resided. He followed the king
also in war to the fertile regions of England, where he employed his
leisure hours so actively in raising subsidies among the boors of
Northumberland and Durham, that upon his return he was enabled to erect a
stone tower, or fortalice, so much admired by his dependants and
neighbours that he, who had hitherto been called Ian Mac-Ivor, or John
the son of Ivor, was thereafter distinguished, both in song and
genealogy, by the high title of Ian nan Chaistel, or John of the Tower.
The descendants of this worthy were so proud of him that the reigning
chief always bore the patronymic title of Vich Ian Vohr, i.e. the son of
John the Great; while the clan at large, to distinguish them from that
from which they had seceded, were denominated Sliochd nan Ivor, the race
of Ivor.

The father of Fergus, the tenth in direct descent from John of the Tower,
engaged heart and hand in the insurrection of 1715, and was forced to fly
to France, after the attempt of that year in favour of the Stuarts had
proved unsuccessful. More fortunate than other fugitives, he obtained
employment in the French service, and married a lady of rank in that
kingdom, by whom he had two children, Fergus and his sister Flora. The
Scottish estate had been forfeited and exposed to sale, but was
repurchased for a small price in the name of the young proprietor, who in
consequence came to reside upon his native domains. [Footnote: See Note
18.] It was soon perceived that he possessed a character of uncommon
acuteness, fire, and ambition, which, as he became acquainted with the
state of the country, gradually assumed a mixed and peculiar tone, that
could only have been acquired Sixty Years Since.

Had Fergus Mac-Ivor lived Sixty Years sooner than he did, he would in all
probability have wanted the polished manner and knowledge of the world
which he now possessed; and had he lived Sixty Years later, his ambition
and love of rule would have lacked the fuel which his situation now
afforded. He was indeed, within his little circle, as perfect a
politician as Castruccio Castracani himself. He applied himself with
great earnestness to appease all the feuds and dissensions which often
arose among other clans in his neighbourhood, so that he became a
frequent umpire in their quarrels. His own patriarchal power he
strengthened at every expense which his fortune would permit, and indeed
stretched his means to the uttermost to maintain the rude and plentiful
hospitality which was the most valued attribute of a chieftain. For the
same reason he crowded his estate with a tenantry, hardy indeed, and fit
for the purposes of war, but greatly outnumbering what the soil was
calculated to maintain. These consisted chiefly of his own clan, not one
of whom he suffered to quit his lands if he could possibly prevent it.
But he maintained, besides, many adventurers from the mother sept, who
deserted a less warlike, though more wealthy chief to do homage to Fergus
Mac-Ivor. Other individuals, too, who had not even that apology, were
nevertheless received into his allegiance, which indeed was refused to
none who were, like Poins, proper men of their hands, and were willing to
assume the name of Mac-Ivor.

He was enabled to discipline these forces, from having obtained command
of one of the independent companies raised by government to preserve the
peace of the Highlands. While in this capacity he acted with vigour and
spirit, and preserved great order in the country under his charge. He
caused his vassals to enter by rotation into his company, and serve for a
certain space of time, which gave them all in turn a general notion of
military discipline. In his campaigns against the banditti, it was
observed that he assumed and exercised to the utmost the discretionary
power which, while the law had no free course in the Highlands, was
conceived to belong to the military parties who were called in to support
it. He acted, for example, with great and suspicious lenity to those
freebooters who made restitution on his summons and offered personal
submission to himself, while he rigorously pursued, apprehended, and
sacrificed to justice all such interlopers as dared to despise his
admonitions or commands. On the other hand, if any officers of justice,
military parties, or others, presumed to pursue thieves or marauders
through his territories, and without applying for his consent and
concurrence, nothing was more certain than that they would meet with some
notable foil or defeat; upon which occasions Fergus Mac-Ivor was the
first to condole with them, and after gently blaming their rashness,
never failed deeply to lament the lawless state of the country. These
lamentations did not exclude suspicion, and matters were so represented
to government that our Chieftain was deprived of his military command.
[Footnote: See Note 19.]

Whatever Fergus Mac-Ivor felt on this occasion, he had the art of
entirely suppressing every appearance of discontent; but in a short time
the neighbouring country began to feel bad effects from his disgrace.
Donald Bean Lean, and others of his class, whose depredations had
hitherto been confined to other districts, appeared from thenceforward to
have made a settlement on this devoted border; and their ravages were
carried on with little opposition, as the Lowland gentry were chiefly
Jacobites, and disarmed. This forced many of the inhabitants into
contracts of black-mail with Fergus Mac-Ivor, which not only established
him their protector, and gave him great weight in all their
consultations, but, moreover, supplied funds for the waste of his feudal
hospitality, which the discontinuance of his pay might have otherwise
essentially diminished.

In following this course of conduct, Fergus had a further object than
merely being the great man of his neighbourhood, and ruling despotically
over a small clan. From his infancy upward he had devoted himself to the
cause of the exiled family, and had persuaded himself, not only that
their restoration to the crown of Britain would be speedy, but that those
who assisted them would be raised to honour and rank. It was with this
view that he laboured to reconcile the Highlanders among themselves, and
augmented his own force to the utmost, to be prepared for the first
favourable opportunity of rising. With this purpose also he conciliated
the favour of such Lowland gentlemen in the vicinity as were friends to
the good cause; and for the same reason, having incautiously quarrelled
with Mr. Bradwardine, who, notwithstanding his peculiarities, was much
respected in the country, he took advantage of the foray of Donald Bean
Lean to solder up the dispute in the manner we have mentioned. Some,
indeed, surmised that he caused the enterprise to be suggested to Donald,
on purpose to pave the way to a reconciliation, which, supposing that to
be the case, cost the Laird of Bradwardine two good milch cows. This zeal
in their behalf the House of Stuart repaid with a considerable share of
their confidence, an occasional supply of louis-dâ€™or, abundance of fair
words, and a parchment, with a huge waxen seal appended, purporting to be
an earlâ€™s patent, granted by no less a person than James the Third King
of England, and Eighth King of Scotland, to his right feal, trusty, and
well-beloved Fergus Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich, in the county of Perth, and
kingdom of Scotland.

With this future coronet glittering before his eyes, Fergus plunged
deeply into the correspondence and plots of that unhappy period; and,
like all such active agents, easily reconciled his conscience to going
certain lengths in the service of his party, from which honour and pride
would have deterred him had his sole object been the direct advancement
of his own personal interest. With this insight into a bold, ambitious,
and ardent, yet artful and politic character, we resume the broken thread
of our narrative.

The chief and his guest had by this time reached the house of
Glennaquoich, which consisted of Ian nan Chaistelâ€™s mansion, a high
rude-looking square tower, with the addition of a lofted house, that is,
a building of two stories, constructed by Fergusâ€™s grandfather when he
returned from that memorable expedition, well remembered by the western
shires under the name of the Highland Host. Upon occasion of this crusade
against the Ayrshire Whigs and Covenanters, the Vich Ian Vohr of the time
had probably been as successful as his predecessor was in harrying
Northumberland, and therefore left to his posterity a rival edifice as a
monument of his magnificence.

Around the house, which stood on an eminence in the midst of a narrow
Highland valley, there appeared none of that attention to convenience,
far less to ornament and decoration, which usually surrounds a
gentlemanâ€™s habitation. An inclosure or two, divided by dry-stone walls,
were the only part of the domain that was fenced; as to the rest, the
narrow slips of level ground which lay by the side of the brook exhibited
a scanty crop of barley, liable to constant depredations from the herds
of wild ponies and black cattle that grazed upon the adjacent hills.
These ever and anon made an incursion upon the arable ground, which was
repelled by the loud, uncouth, and dissonant shouts of half a dozen
Highland swains, all running as if they had been mad, and every one
hallooing a half-starved dog to the rescue of the forage. At a little
distance up the glen was a small and stunted wood of birch; the hills
were high and heathy, but without any variety of surface; so that the
whole view was wild and desolate rather than grand and solitary. Yet,
such as it was, no genuine descendant of Ian nan Chaistel would have
changed the domain for Stow or Blenheim.

There was a sight, however, before the gate, which perhaps would have
afforded the first owner of Blenheim more pleasure than the finest view
in the domain assigned to him by the gratitude of his country. This
consisted of about a hundred Highlanders, in complete dress and arms; at
sight of whom the Chieftain apologised to Waverley in a sort of negligent
manner. â€˜He had forgot,â€™ he said, â€˜that he had ordered a few of his clan
out, for the purpose of seeing that they were in a fit condition to
protect the country, and prevent such accidents as, he was sorry to
learn, had befallen the Baron of Bradwardine. Before they were dismissed,
perhaps Captain Waverley might choose to see them go through a part of
their exercise.â€™

Edward assented, and the men executed with agility and precision some of
the ordinary military movements. They then practised individually at a
mark, and showed extraordinary dexterity in the management of the pistol
and firelock. They took aim, standing, sitting, leaning, or lying
prostrate, as they were commanded, and always with effect upon the
target. Next, they paired off for the broadsword exercise; and, having
manifested their individual skill and dexterity, united in two bodies,
and exhibited a sort of mock encounter, in which the charge, the rally,
the flight, the pursuit, and all the current of a heady fight, were
exhibited to the sound of the great war bagpipe.

On a signal made by the Chief, the skirmish was ended. Matches were then
made for running, wrestling, leaping, pitching the bar, and other sports,
in which this feudal militia displayed incredible swiftness, strength,
and agility; and accomplished the purpose which their Chieftain had at
heart, by impressing on Waverley no light sense of their merit as
soldiers, and of the power of him who commanded them by his nod.
[Footnote: See Note 20.]

â€˜And what number of such gallant fellows have the happiness to call you
leader?â€™ asked Waverley.

â€˜In a good cause, and under a chieftain whom they loved, the race of Ivor
have seldom taken the field under five hundred claymores. But you are
aware, Captain Waverley, that the disarming act, passed about twenty
years ago, prevents their being in the complete state of preparation as
in former times; and I keep no more of my clan under arms than may defend
my own or my friendsâ€™ property, when the country is troubled with such
men as your last nightâ€™s landlord; and government, which has removed
other means of defence, must connive at our protecting ourselves.â€™

â€˜But, with your force, you might soon destroy or put down such gangs as
that of Donald Bean Lean.â€™

â€˜Yes, doubtless; and my reward would be a summons to deliver up to
General Blakeney, at Stirling, the few broadswords they have left us;
there were little policy in that, methinks. But come, captain, the sound
of the pipes informs me that dinner is prepared. Let me have the honour
to show you into my rude mansion.â€™




CHAPTER XX

A HIGHLAND FEAST


Ere Waverley entered the banqueting hall, he was offered the patriarchal
refreshment of a bath for the feet, which the sultry weather, and the
morasses he had traversed, rendered highly acceptable. He was not,
indeed, so luxuriously attended upon this occasion as the heroic
travellers in the Odyssey; the task of ablution and abstersion being
performed, not by a beautiful damsel, trained

To chafe the limb, and pour the fragrant oil,

but by a smoke-dried skinny old Highland woman, who did not seem to think
herself much honoured by the duty imposed upon her, but muttered between
her teeth, â€˜Our fathersâ€™ herds did not feed so near together that I
should do you this service.â€™ A small donation, however, amply reconciled
this ancient handmaiden to the supposed degradation; and, as Edward
proceeded to the hall, she gave him her blessing in the Gaelic proverb,
â€˜May the open hand be filled the fullest.â€™

The hall, in which the feast was prepared, occupied all the first story
of Ian nan Chaistelâ€™s original erection, and a huge oaken table extended
through its whole length. The apparatus for dinner was simple, even to
rudeness, and the company numerous, even to crowding. At the head of the
table was the Chief himself, with Edward, and two or three Highland
visitors of neighbouring clans; the elders of his own tribe, wadsetters
and tacksmen, as they were called, who occupied portions of his estate as
mortgagers or lessees, sat next in rank; beneath them, their sons and
nephews and foster-brethren; then the officers of the Chiefâ€™s household,
according to their order; and lowest of all, the tenants who actually
cultivated the ground. Even beyond this long perspective, Edward might
see upon the green, to which a huge pair of folding doors opened, a
multitude of Highlanders of a yet inferior description, who,
nevertheless, were considered as guests, and had their share both of the
countenance of the entertainer and of the cheer of the day. In the
distance, and fluctuating round this extreme verge of the banquet, was a
changeful group of women, ragged boys and girls, beggars, young and old,
large greyhounds, and terriers, and pointers, and curs of low degree; all
of whom took some interest, more or less immediate, in the main action of
the piece.

This hospitality, apparently unbounded, had yet its line of economy. Some
pains had been bestowed in dressing the dishes of fish, game, etc., which
were at the upper end of the table, and immediately under the eye of the
English stranger. Lower down stood immense clumsy joints of mutton and
beef, which, but for the absence of pork, [Footnote: See Note 21.]
abhorred in the Highlands, resembled the rude festivity of the banquet of
Penelopeâ€™s suitors. But the central dish was a yearling lamb, called â€˜a
hog in harâ€™st,â€™ roasted whole. It was set upon its legs, with a bunch of
parsley in its mouth, and was probably exhibited in that form to gratify
the pride of the cook, who piqued himself more on the plenty than the
elegance of his masterâ€™s table. The sides of this poor animal were
fiercely attacked by the clansmen, some with dirks, others with the
knives which were usually in the same sheath with the dagger, so that it
was soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle. Lower down still, the
victuals seemed of yet coarser quality, though sufficiently abundant.
Broth, onions, cheese, and the fragments of the feast regaled the sons of
Ivor who feasted in the open air.

The liquor was supplied in the same proportion, and under similar
regulations. Excellent claret and champagne were liberally distributed
among the Chiefâ€™s immediate neighbours; whisky, plain or diluted, and
strong beer refreshed those who sat near the lower end. Nor did this
inequality of distribution appear to give the least offence. Every one
present understood that his taste was to be formed according to the rank
which he held at table; and, consequently, the tacksmen and their
dependants always professed the wine was too cold for their stomachs, and
called, apparently out of choice, for the liquor which was assigned to
them from economy. [Footnote: See Note 22.] The bag-pipers, three in
number, screamed, during the whole time of dinner, a tremendous war-tune;
and the echoing of the vaulted roof, and clang of the Celtic tongue,
produced such a Babel of noises that Waverley dreaded his ears would
never recover it. Mac-Ivor, indeed, apologised for the confusion
occasioned by so large a party, and pleaded the necessity of his
situation, on which unlimited hospitality was imposed as a paramount
duty. â€˜These stout idle kinsmen of mine,â€™ he said, â€˜account my estate as
held in trust for their support; and I must find them beef and ale, while
the rogues will do nothing for themselves but practise the broadsword, or
wander about the hills, shooting, fishing, hunting, drinking, and making
love to the lasses of the strath. But what can I do, Captain Waverley?
everything will keep after its kind, whether it be a hawk or a
Highlander.â€™ Edward made the expected answer, in a compliment upon his
possessing so many bold and attached followers.

â€˜Why, yes,â€™ replied the Chief, â€˜were I disposed, like my father, to put
myself in the way of getting one blow on the head, or two on the neck, I
believe the loons would stand by me. But who thinks of that in the
present day, when the maxim is, â€œBetter an old woman with a purse in her
hand than three men with belted brandsâ€?â€™ Then, turning to the company,
he proposed the â€˜Health of Captain Waverley, a worthy friend of his kind
neighbour and ally, the Baron of Bradwardine.â€™

â€˜He is welcome hither,â€™ said one of the elders, â€˜if he come from Cosmo
Comyne Bradwardine.â€™

â€˜I say nay to that,â€™ said an old man, who apparently did not mean to
pledge the toast; â€˜I say nay to that. While there is a green leaf in the
forest, there will be fraud in a Comyne.

â€˜There is nothing but honour in the Baron of Bradwardine,â€™ answered
another ancient; â€˜and the guest that comes hither from him should be
welcome, though he came with blood on his hand, unless it were blood of
the race of Ivor.â€™

The old man whose cup remained full replied, â€˜There has been blood enough
of the race of Ivor on the hand of Bradwardine.â€™

â€˜Ah! Ballenkeiroch,â€™ replied the first, â€˜you think rather of the flash of
the carbine at the mains of Tully-Veolan than the glance of the sword
that fought for the cause at Preston.â€™

â€˜And well I may,â€™ answered Ballenkeiroch; â€˜the flash of the gun cost me a
fair-haired son, and the glance of the sword has done but little for King
James.â€™

The Chieftain, in two words of French, explained to Waverley that the
Baron had shot this old manâ€™s son in a fray near Tully-Veolan, about
seven years before; and then hastened to remove Ballenkeirochâ€™s
prejudice, by informing him that Waverley was an Englishman, unconnected
by birth or alliance with the family of Bradwardine; upon which the old
gentleman raised the hitherto-untasted cup and courteously drank to his
health. This ceremony being requited in kind, the Chieftain made a signal
for the pipes to cease, and said aloud, â€˜Where is the song hidden, my
friends, that Mac-Murrough cannot find it?â€™

Mac-Murrough, the family bhairdh, an aged man, immediately took the hint,
and began to chant, with low and rapid utterance, a profusion of Celtic
verses, which were received by the audience with all the applause of
enthusiasm. As he advanced in his declamation, his ardour seemed to
increase. He had at first spoken with his eyes fixed on the ground; he
now cast them around as if beseeching, and anon as if commanding,
attention, and his tones rose into wild and impassioned notes,
accompanied with appropriate gestures. He seemed to Edward, who attended
to him with much interest, to recite many proper names, to lament the
dead, to apostrophise the absent, to exhort, and entreat, and animate
those who were present. Waverley thought he even discerned his own name,
and was convinced his conjecture was right from the eyes of the company
being at that moment turned towards him simultaneously. The ardour of the
poet appeared to communicate itself to the audience. Their wild and
sun-burnt countenances assumed a fiercer and more animated expression;
all bent forward towards the reciter, many sprung up and waved their arms
in ecstasy, and some laid their hands on their swords. When the song
ceased, there was a deep pause, while the aroused feelings of the poet
and of the hearers gradually subsided into their usual channel.

The Chieftain, who, during this scene had appeared rather to watch the
emotions which were excited than to partake their high tone of
enthusiasm, filled with claret a small silver cup which stood by him.
â€˜Give this,â€™ he said to an attendant, â€˜to Mac-Murrough nan Fonn (i.e. of
the songs), and when he has drank the juice, bid him keep, for the sake
of Vich Ian Vohr, the shell of the gourd which contained it.â€™ The gift
was received by Mac-Murrough with profound gratitude; he drank the wine,
and, kissing the cup, shrouded it with reverence in the plaid which was
folded on his bosom. He then burst forth into what Edward justly supposed
to be an extemporaneous effusion of thanks and praises of his Chief. It
was received with applause, but did not produce the effect of his first
poem. It was obvious, however, that the clan regarded the generosity of
their Chieftain with high approbation. Many approved Gaelic toasts were
then proposed, of some of which the Chieftain gave his guest the
following versions:--

â€˜To him that will not turn his back on friend or foe.â€™ â€˜To him that never
forsook a comrade.â€™ â€˜To him that never bought or sold justice.â€™
â€˜Hospitality to the exile, and broken bones to the tyrant.â€™ â€˜The lads
with the kilts.â€™ â€˜Highlanders, shoulder to shoulder,â€™--with many other
pithy sentiments of the like nature.

Edward was particularly solicitous to know the meaning of that song which
appeared to produce such effect upon the passions of the company, and
hinted his curiosity to his host. â€˜As I observe,â€™ said the Chieftain,
â€˜that you have passed the bottle during the last three rounds, I was
about to propose to you to retire to my sisterâ€™s tea-table, who can
explain these things to you better than I can. Although I cannot stint my
clan in the usual current of their festivity, yet I neither am addicted
myself to exceed in its amount, nor do I,â€™ added he, smiling, â€˜keep a
Bear to devour the intellects of such as can make good use of them.â€™

Edward readily assented to this proposal, and the Chieftain, saying a few
words to those around him, left the table, followed by Waverley. As the
door closed behind them, Edward heard Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s health invoked with
a wild and animated cheer, that expressed the satisfaction of the guests
and the depth of their devotion to his service.




CHAPTER XXI

THE CHIEFTAINâ€™S SISTER


The drawing-room of Flora Mac-Ivor was furnished in the plainest and most
simple manner; for at Glennaquoich every other sort of expenditure was
retrenched as much as possible, for the purpose of maintaining, in its
full dignity, the hospitality of the Chieftain, and retaining and
multiplying the number of his dependants and adherents. But there was no
appearance of this parsimony in the dress of the lady herself, which was
in texture elegant, and even rich, and arranged in a manner which partook
partly of the Parisian fashion and partly of the more simple dress of the
Highlands, blended together with great taste. Her hair was not disfigured
by the art of the friseur, but fell in jetty ringlets on her neck,
confined only by a circlet, richly set with diamonds. This peculiarity
she adopted in compliance with the Highland prejudices, which could not
endure that a womanâ€™s head should be covered before wedlock.

Flora Mac-Ivor bore a most striking resemblance to her brother Fergus; so
much so that they might have played Viola and Sebastian with the same
exquisite effect produced by the appearance of Mrs. Henry Siddons and her
brother, Mr. William Murray, in these characters. They had the same
antique and regular correctness of profile; the same dark eyes,
eye-lashes, and eye-brows; the same clearness of complexion, excepting
that Fergusâ€™s was embrowned by exercise and Floraâ€™s possessed the utmost
feminine delicacy. But the haughty and somewhat stern regularity of
Fergusâ€™s features was beautifully softened in those of Flora. Their
voices were also similar in tone, though differing in the key. That of
Fergus, especially while issuing orders to his followers during their
military exercise, reminded Edward of a favourite passage in the
description of Emetrius:
   --whose voice was heard around,
    Loud as a trumpet with a silver sound.
That of Flora, on the contrary, was soft and sweet--â€˜an excellent thing
in womanâ€™; yet, in urging any favourite topic, which she often pursued
with natural eloquence, it possessed as well the tones which impress awe
and conviction as those of persuasive insinuation. The eager glance of
the keen black eye, which, in the Chieftain, seemed impatient even of the
material obstacles it encountered, had in his sister acquired a gentle
pensiveness. His looks seemed to seek glory, power, all that could exalt
him above others in the race of humanity; while those of his sister, as
if she were already conscious of mental superiority, seemed to pity,
rather than envy, those who were struggling for any farther distinction.
Her sentiments corresponded with the expression of her countenance. Early
education had impressed upon her mind, as well as on that of the
Chieftain, the most devoted attachment to the exiled family of Stuart.
She believed it the duty of her brother, of his clan, of every man in
Britain, at whatever personal hazard, to contribute to that restoration
which the partisans of the Chevalier St. George had not ceased to hope
for. For this she was prepared to do all, to suffer all, to sacrifice
all. But her loyalty, as it exceeded her brotherâ€™s in fanaticism,
excelled it also in purity. Accustomed to petty intrigue, and necessarily
involved in a thousand paltry and selfish discussions, ambitious also by
nature, his political faith was tinctured, at least, if not tainted, by
the views of interest and advancement so easily combined with it; and at
the moment he should unsheathe his claymore, it might be difficult to say
whether it would be most with the view of making James Stuart a king or
Fergus Mac-Ivor an earl. This, indeed, was a mixture of feeling which he
did not avow even to himself, but it existed, nevertheless, in a powerful
degree.

In Floraâ€™s bosom, on the contrary, the zeal of loyalty burnt pure and
unmixed with any selfish feeling; she would have as soon made religion
the mask of ambitious and interested views as have shrouded them under
the opinions which she had been taught to think patriotism. Such
instances of devotion were not uncommon among the followers of the
unhappy race of Stuart, of which many memorable proofs will recur to the
minds of most of my readers. But peculiar attention on the part of the
Chevalier de St. George and his princess to the parents of Fergus and his
sister, and to themselves when orphans, had riveted their faith. Fergus,
upon the death of his parents, had been for some time a page of honour in
the train of the Chevalierâ€™s lady, and, from his beauty and sprightly
temper, was uniformly treated by her with the utmost distinction. This
was also extended to Flora, who was maintained for some time at a convent
of the first order at the princessâ€™s expense, and removed from thence
into her own family, where she spent nearly two years. Both brother and
sister retained the deepest and most grateful sense of her kindness.

Having thus touched upon the leading principle of Floraâ€™s character, I
may dismiss the rest more slightly. She was highly accomplished, and had
acquired those elegant manners to be expected from one who, in early
youth, had been the companion of a princess; yet she had not learned to
substitute the gloss of politeness for the reality of feeling. When
settled in the lonely regions of Glennaquoich, she found that her
resources in French, English, and Italian literature were likely to be
few and interrupted; and, in order to fill up the vacant time, she
bestowed a part of it upon the music and poetical traditions of the
Highlanders, and began really to feel the pleasure in the pursuit which
her brother, whose perceptions of literary merit were more blunt, rather
affected for the sake of popularity than actually experienced. Her
resolution was strengthened in these researches by the extreme delight
which her inquiries seemed to afford those to whom she resorted for
information.

Her love of her clan, an attachment which was almost hereditary in her
bosom, was, like her loyalty, a more pure passion than that of her
brother. He was too thorough a politician, regarded his patriarchal
influence too much as the means of accomplishing his own aggrandisement,
that we should term him the model of a Highland Chieftain. Flora felt the
same anxiety for cherishing and extending their patriarchal sway, but it
was with the generous desire of vindicating from poverty, or at least
from want and foreign oppression, those whom her brother was by birth,
according to the notions of the time and country, entitled to govern. The
savings of her income, for she had a small pension from the Princess
Sobieski, were dedicated, not to add to the comforts of the peasantry,
for that was a word which they neither knew nor apparently wished to
know, but to relieve their absolute necessities when in sickness or
extreme old age. At every other period they rather toiled to procure
something which they might share with the Chief, as a proof of their
attachment, than expected other assistance from him save what was
afforded by the rude hospitality of his castle, and the general division
and subdivision of his estate among them. Flora was so much beloved by
them that, when Mac-Murrough composed a song in which he enumerated all
the principal beauties of the district, and intimated her superiority by
concluding, that â€˜the fairest apple hung on the highest bough,â€™ he
received, in donatives from the individuals of the clan, more seed-barley
than would have sowed his Highland Parnassus, the bardâ€™s croft, as it was
called, ten times over.

From situation as well as choice, Miss Mac-Ivorâ€™s society was extremely
limited. Her most intimate friend had been Rose Bradwardine, to whom she
was much attached; and when seen together, they would have afforded an
artist two admirable subjects for the gay and the melancholy muse. Indeed
Rose was so tenderly watched by her father, and her circle of wishes was
so limited, that none arose but what he was willing to gratify, and
scarce any which did not come within the compass of his power. With Flora
it was otherwise. While almost a girl she had undergone the most complete
change of scene, from gaiety and splendour to absolute solitude and
comparative poverty; and the ideas and wishes which she chiefly fostered
respected great national events, and changes not to be brought round
without both hazard and bloodshed, and therefore not to be thought of
with levity. Her manner, consequently, was grave, though she readily
contributed her talents to the amusement of society, and stood very high
in the opinion of the old Baron, who used to sing along with her such
French duets of Lindor and Cloris, etc., as were in fashion about the end
of the reign of old Louis le Grand.

It was generally believed, though no one durst have hinted it to the
Baron of Bradwardine, that Floraâ€™s entreaties had no small share in
allaying the wrath of Fergus upon occasion of their quarrel. She took her
brother on the assailable side, by dwelling first upon the Baronâ€™s age,
and then representing the injury which the cause might sustain, and the
damage which must arise to his own character in point of prudence--so
necessary to a political agent, if he persisted in carrying it to
extremity. Otherwise it is probable it would have terminated in a duel,
both because the Baron had, on a former occasion, shed blood of the clan,
though the matter had been timely accommodated, and on account of his
high reputation for address at his weapon, which Fergus almost
condescended to envy. For the same reason she had urged their
reconciliation, which the Chieftain the more readily agreed to as it
favoured some ulterior projects of his own.

To this young lady, now presiding at the female empire of the tea-table,
Fergus introduced Captain Waverley, whom she received with the usual
forms of politeness.




CHAPTER XXII

HIGHLAND MINSTRELSY


When the first salutations had passed, Fergus said to his sister, â€˜My
dear Flora, before I return to the barbarous ritual of our forefathers, I
must tell you that Captain Waverley is a worshipper of the Celtic muse,
not the less so perhaps that he does not understand a word of her
language. I have told him you are eminent as a translator of Highland
poetry, and that Mac-Murrough admires your version of his songs upon the
same principle that Captain Waverley admires the original,--because he
does not comprehend them. Will you have the goodness to read or recite to
our guest in English the extraordinary string of names which Mac-Murrough
has tacked together in Gaelic? My life to a moor-fowlâ€™s feather, you are
provided with a version; for I know you are in all the bardâ€™s councils,
and acquainted with his songs long before he rehearses them in the hall.â€™

â€˜How can you say so, Fergus? You know how little these verses can
possibly interest an English stranger, even if I could translate them as
you pretend.â€™

â€˜Not less than they interest me, lady fair. To-day your joint
composition, for I insist you had a share in it, has cost me the last
silver cup in the castle, and I suppose will cost me something else next
time I hold cour pleniere, if the muse descends on Mac-Murrough; for you
know our proverb,--â€œWhen the hand of the chief ceases to bestow, the
breath of the bard is frozen in the utterance.â€--Well, I would it were
even so: there are three things that are useless to a modern
Highlander,--a sword which he must not draw, a bard to sing of deeds
which he dare not imitate, and a large goat-skin purse without a
louis-dâ€™or to put into it.â€™

â€˜Well, brother, since you betray my secrets, you cannot expect me to keep
yours. I assure you, Captain Waverley, that Fergus is too proud to
exchange his broadsword for a marechalâ€™s baton, that he esteems
Mac-Murrough a far greater poet than Homer, and would not give up his
goat-skin purse for all the louis-dâ€™or which it could contain.â€™

â€˜Well pronounced, Flora; blow for blow, as Conan [Footnote: See Note 23.]
said to the devil. Now do you two talk of bards and poetry, if not of
purses and claymores, while I return to do the final honours to the
senators of the tribe of Ivor.â€™ So saying, he left the room.

The conversation continued between Flora and Waverley; for two
well-dressed young women, whose character seemed to hover between that of
companions and dependants, took no share in it. They were both pretty
girls, but served only as foils to the grace and beauty of their
patroness. The discourse followed the turn which the Chieftain had given
it, and Waverley was equally amused and surprised with the account which
the lady gave him of Celtic poetry.

â€˜The recitation,â€™ she said, â€˜of poems recording the feats of heroes, the
complaints of lovers, and the wars of contending tribes, forms the chief
amusement of a winter fire-side in the Highlands. Some of these are said
to be very ancient, and if they are ever translated into any of the
languages of civilised Europe, cannot fail to produce a deep and general
sensation. Others are more modern, the composition of those family bards
whom the chieftains of more distinguished name and power retain as the
poets and historians of their tribes. These, of course, possess various
degrees of merit; but much of it must evaporate in translation, or be
lost on those who do not sympathise with the feelings of the poet.â€™

â€˜And your bard, whose effusions seemed to produce such effect upon the
company to-day, is he reckoned among the favourite poets of the
mountains?â€™

â€˜That is a trying question. His reputation is high among his countrymen,
and you must not expect me to depreciate it. [Footnote: The Highland poet
almost always was an improvisatore. Captain Burt met one of them at
Lovatâ€™s table.]

â€˜But the song, Miss Mac-Ivor, seemed to awaken all those warriors, both
young and old.â€™

â€˜The song is little more than a catalogue of names of the Highland clans
under their distinctive peculiarities, and an exhortation to them to
remember and to emulate the actions of their forefathers.â€™

â€˜And am I wrong in conjecturing, however extraordinary the guess appears,
that there was some allusion to me in the verses which he recited?â€™

â€˜You have a quick observation, Captain Waverley, which in this instance
has not deceived you. The Gaelic language, being uncommonly vocalic, is
well adapted for sudden and extemporaneous poetry; and a bard seldom
fails to augment the effects of a premeditated song by throwing in any
stanzas which may be suggested by the circumstances attending the
recitation.â€™

â€˜I would give my best horse to know what the Highland bard could find to
say of such an unworthy Southron as myself.â€™

â€˜It shall not even cost you a lock of his mane. Una, mavourneen! (She
spoke a few words to one of the young girls in attendance, who instantly
curtsied and tripped out of the room.) I have sent Una to learn from the
bard the expressions he used, and you shall command my skill as
dragoman.â€™

Una returned in a few minutes, and repeated to her mistress a few lines
in Gaelic. Flora seemed to think for a moment, and then, slightly
colouring, she turned to Waverley--â€˜It is impossible to gratify your
curiosity, Captain Waverley, without exposing my own presumption. If you
will give me a few moments for consideration, I will endeavour to engraft
the meaning of these lines upon a rude English translation which I have
attempted of a part of the original. The duties of the tea-table seem to
be concluded, and, as the evening is delightful, Una will show you the
way to one of my favourite haunts, and Cathleen and I will join you
there.â€™

Una, having received instructions in her native language, conducted
Waverley out by a passage different from that through which he had
entered the apartment. At a distance he heard the hall of the Chief still
resounding with the clang of bagpipes and the high applause of his
guests. Having gained the open air by a postern door, they walked a
little way up the wild, bleak, and narrow valley in which the house was
situated, following the course of the stream that winded through it. In a
spot, about a quarter of a mile from the castle, two brooks, which formed
the little river, had their junction. The larger of the two came down the
long bare valley, which extended, apparently without any change or
elevation of character, as far as the hills which formed its boundary
permitted the eye to reach. But the other stream, which had its source
among the mountains on the left hand of the strath, seemed to issue from
a very narrow and dark opening betwixt two large rocks. These streams
were different also in character. The larger was placid, and even sullen
in its course, wheeling in deep eddies, or sleeping in dark blue pools;
but the motions of the lesser brook were rapid and furious, issuing from
between precipices, like a maniac from his confinement, all foam and
uproar.

It was up the course of this last stream that Waverley, like a knight of
romance, was conducted by the fair Highland damsel, his silent guide. A
small path, which had been rendered easy in many places for Floraâ€™s
accommodation, led him through scenery of a very different description
from that which he had just quitted. Around the castle all was cold,
bare, and desolate, yet tame even in desolation; but this narrow glen, at
so short a distance, seemed to open into the land of romance. The rocks
assumed a thousand peculiar and varied forms. In one place a crag of huge
size presented its gigantic bulk, as if to forbid the passengerâ€™s farther
progress; and it was not until he approached its very base that Waverley
discerned the sudden and acute turn by which the pathway wheeled its
course around this formidable obstacle. In another spot the projecting
rocks from the opposite sides of the chasm had approached so near to each
other that two pine-trees laid across, and covered with turf, formed a
rustic bridge at the height of at least one hundred and fifty feet. It
had no ledges, and was barely three feet in breadth.

While gazing at this pass of peril, which crossed, like a single black
line, the small portion of blue sky not intercepted by the projecting
rocks on either side, it was with a sensation of horror that Waverley
beheld Flora and her attendant appear, like inhabitants of another
region, propped, as it were, in mid air, upon this trembling structure.
She stopped upon observing him below, and, with an air of graceful ease
which made him shudder, waved her handkerchief to him by way of signal.
He was unable, from the sense of dizziness which her situation conveyed,
to return the salute; and was never more relieved than when the fair
apparition passed on from the precarious eminence which she seemed to
occupy with so much indifference, and disappeared on the other side.

Advancing a few yards, and passing under the bridge which he had viewed
with so much terror, the path ascended rapidly from the edge of the
brook, and the glen widened into a sylvan amphitheatre, waving with
birch, young oaks, and hazels, with here and there a scattered yew-tree.
The rocks now receded, but still showed their grey and shaggy crests
rising among the copse-wood. Still higher rose eminences and peaks, some
bare, some clothed with wood, some round and purple with heath, and
others splintered into rocks and crags. At a short turning the path,
which had for some furlongs lost sight of the brook, suddenly placed
Waverley in front of a romantic waterfall. It was not so remarkable
either for great height or quantity of water as for the beautiful
accompaniments which made the spot interesting. After a broken cataract
of about twenty feet, the stream was received in a large natural basin
filled to the brim with water, which, where the bubbles of the fall
subsided, was so exquisitely clear that, although it was of great depth,
the eye could discern each pebble at the bottom. Eddying round this
reservoir, the brook found its way as if over a broken part of the ledge,
and formed a second fall, which seemed to seek the very abyss; then,
wheeling out beneath from among the smooth dark rocks which it had
polished for ages, it wandered murmuring down the glen, forming the
stream up which Waverley had just ascended. [Footnote: See Note 24.] The
borders of this romantic reservoir corresponded in beauty; but it was
beauty of a stern and commanding cast, as if in the act of expanding into
grandeur. Mossy banks of turf were broken and interrupted by huge
fragments of rock, and decorated with trees and shrubs, some of which had
been planted under the direction of Flora, but so cautiously that they
added to the grace without diminishing the romantic wildness of the
scene.

Here, like one of those lovely forms which decorate the landscapes of
Poussin, Waverley found Flora gazing on the waterfall. Two paces further
back stood Cathleen, holding a small Scottish harp, the use of which had
been taught to Flora by Rory Dall, one of the last harpers of the Western
Highlands. The sun, now stooping in the west, gave a rich and varied
tinge to all the objects which surrounded Waverley, and seemed to add
more than human brilliancy to the full expressive darkness of Floraâ€™s
eye, exalted the richness and purity of her complexion, and enhanced the
dignity and grace of her beautiful form. Edward thought he had never,
even in his wildest dreams, imagined a figure of such exquisite and
interesting loveliness. The wild beauty of the retreat, bursting upon him
as if by magic, augmented the mingled feeling of delight and awe with
which he approached her, like a fair enchantress of Boiardo or Ariosto,
by whose nod the scenery around seemed to have been created an Eden in
the wilderness.

Flora, like every beautiful woman, was conscious of her own power, and
pleased with its effects, which she could easily discern from the
respectful yet confused address of the young soldier. But, as she
possessed excellent sense, she gave the romance of the scene and other
accidental circumstances full weight in appreciating the feelings with
which Waverley seemed obviously to be impressed; and, unacquainted with
the fanciful and susceptible peculiarities of his character, considered
his homage as the passing tribute which a woman of even inferior charms
might have expected in such a situation. She therefore quietly led the
way to a spot at such a distance from the cascade that its sound should
rather accompany than interrupt that of her voice and instrument, and,
sitting down upon a mossy fragment of rock, she took the harp from
Cathleen.

â€˜I have given you the trouble of walking to this spot, Captain Waverley,
both because I thought the scenery would interest you, and because a
Highland song would suffer still more from my imperfect translation were
I to introduce it without its own wild and appropriate accompaniments. To
speak in the poetical language of my country, the seat of the Celtic Muse
is in the mist of the secret and solitary hill, and her voice in the
murmur of the mountain stream. He who woos her must love the barren rock
more than the fertile valley, and the solitude of the desert better than
the festivity of the hall.â€™

Few could have heard this lovely woman make this declaration, with a
voice where harmony was exalted by pathos, without exclaiming that the
muse whom she invoked could never find a more appropriate representative.
But Waverley, though the thought rushed on his mind, found no courage to
utter it. Indeed, the wild feeling of romantic delight with which he
heard the few first notes she drew from her instrument amounted almost to
a sense of pain. He would not for worlds have quitted his place by her
side; yet he almost longed for solitude, that he might decipher and
examine at leisure the complication of emotions which now agitated his
bosom.

Flora had exchanged the measured and monotonous recitative of the bard
for a lofty and uncommon Highland air, which had been a battle-song in
former ages. A few irregular strains introduced a prelude of a wild and
peculiar tone, which harmonised well with the distant waterfall, and the
soft sigh of the evening breeze in the rustling leaves of an aspen, which
overhung the seat of the fair harpress. The following verses convey but
little idea of the feelings with which, so sung and accompanied, they
were heard by Waverley:--

    There is mist on the mountain, and night on the vale,
    But more dark is the sleep of the sons of the Gael.
    A stranger commanded--it sunk on the land,
    It has frozen each heart, and benumbâ€™d every hand!

    The dirk and the target lie sordid with dust,
    The bloodless claymore is but reddenâ€™d with rust;
    On the hill or the glen if a gun should appear,
    It is only to war with the heath-cock or deer.

    The deeds of our sires if our bards should rehearse,
    Let a blush or a blow be the meed of their verse!
    Be mute every string, and be hushâ€™d every tone,
    That shall bid us remember the fame that is flown.

    But the dark hours of night and of slumber are past,
    The morn on our mountains is dawning at last;
    Glenaladaleâ€™s peaks are illumined with the rays,
    And the streams of Glenfinnan leap bright in the blaze.

[Footnote: The young and daring adventurer, Charles Edward, landed at
Glenaladale, in Moidart, and displayed his standard in the valley of
Glenfinnan, mustering around it the Mac-Donalds, the Camerons, and other
less numerous clans, whom he had prevailed on to join him. There is a
monument erected on the spot, with a Latin inscription by the late Doctor
Gregory.]

    O high-minded Moray! the exiled! the dear!
    In the blush of the dawning the STANDARD uprear!
    Wide, wide on the winds of the north let it fly,
    Like the sunâ€™s latest flash when the tempest is nigh!

[Footnote: The Marquis of Tullibardineâ€™s elder brother, who, long exiled,
returned to Scotland with Charles Edward in 1745.]

    Ye sons of the strong, when that dawning shall break,
    Need the harp of the aged remind you to wake?
    That dawn never beamâ€™d on your forefathersâ€™ eye,
    But it roused each high chieftain to vanquish or die.

    O, sprung from the Kings who in Islay kept state,
    Proud chiefs of Clan Ranald, Glengarry, and Sleat!
    Combine like three streams from one mountain of snow,
    And resistless in union rush down on the foe!

    True son of Sir Evan, undaunted Lochiel,
    Place thy targe on thy shoulder and burnish thy steel!
    Rough Keppoch, give breath to thy bugleâ€™s bold swell,
    Till far Coryarrick resound to the knell!

    Stern son of Lord Kenneth, high chief of Kintail,
    Let the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale!
    May the race of Clan Gillean, the fearless and free,
    Remember Glenlivat, Harlaw, and Dundee!

    Let the clan of grey Fingon, whose offspring has given
    Such heroes to earth and such martyrs to heaven,
    Unite with the race of renownâ€™d Rorri More,
    To launch the long galley and stretch to the oar.

    How Mac-Shimei will joy when their chief shall display
    The yew-crested bonnet oâ€™er tresses of grey!
    How the race of wrongâ€™d Alpine and murderâ€™d Glencoe
    Shall shout for revenge when they pour on the foe!

    Ye sons of brown Dermid, who slew the wild boar,
    Resume the pure faith of the great Callum-More!
    Mac-Neil of the islands, and Moy of the Lake,
    For honour, for freedom, for vengeance awake!

Here a large greyhound, bounding up the glen, jumped upon Flora and
interrupted her music by his importunate caresses. At a distant whistle
he turned and shot down the path again with the rapidity of an arrow.
â€˜That is Fergusâ€™s faithful attendant, Captain Waverley, and that was his
signal. He likes no poetry but what is humorous, and comes in good time
to interrupt my long catalogue of the tribes, whom one of your saucy
English poets calls

    Our bootless host of high-born beggars,
    Mac-Leans, Mac-Kenzies, and Mac-Gregors.â€™

Waverley expressed his regret at the interruption.

â€˜O you cannot guess how much you have lost! The bard, as in duty bound,
has addressed three long stanzas to Vich Ian Vohr of the Banners,
enumerating all his great properties, and not forgetting his being a
cheerer of the harper and bard--â€œa giver of bounteous gifts.â€ Besides,
you should have heard a practical admonition to the fair-haired son of
the stranger, who lives in the land where the grass is always green--the
rider on the shining pampered steed, whose hue is like the raven, and
whose neigh is like the scream of the eagle for battle. This valiant
horseman is affectionately conjured to remember that his ancestors were
distinguished by their loyalty as well as by their courage. All this you
have lost; but, since your curiosity is not satisfied, I judge, from the
distant sound of my brotherâ€™s whistle, I may have time to sing the
concluding stanzas before he comes to laugh at my translation.â€™
    Awake on your hills, on your islands awake,
    Brave sons of the mountain, the frith, and the lake!
    â€˜T is the bugle--but not for the chase is the call;
    â€˜T is the pibrochâ€™s shrill summons--but not to the hall.

    â€˜T is the summons of heroes for conquest or death,
    When the banners are blazing on mountain and heath:
    They call to the dirk, the claymore, and the targe,
    To the march and the muster, the line and the charge.

    Be the brand of each chieftain like Finâ€™s in his ire!
    May the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire!
    Burst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore,
    Or die like your sires, and endure it no more!






CHAPTER XXIII

WAVERLEY CONTINUES AT GLENNAQUOICH


As Flora concluded her song, Fergus stood before them. â€˜I knew I should
find you here, even without the assistance of my friend Bran. A simple
and unsublimed taste now, like my own, would prefer a jet dâ€™eau at
Versailles to this cascade, with all its accompaniments of rock and roar;
but this is Floraâ€™s Parnassus, Captain Waverley, and that fountain her
Helicon. It would be greatly for the benefit of my cellar if she could
teach her coadjutor, Mac-Murrough, the value of its influence: he has
just drunk a pint of usquebaugh to correct, he said, the coldness of the
claret. Let me try its virtues.â€™ He sipped a little water in the hollow
of his hand, and immediately commenced, with a theatrical air,--

    â€˜O Lady of the desert, hail!
     That lovest the harping of the Gael,
     Through fair and fertile regions borne,
     Where never yet grew grass or corn.

But English poetry will never succeed under the influence of a Highland
Helicon. Allons, courage!

O vous, qui buvez, a tasse pleine, A cette heureuse fontaine, Ou on ne
voit, sur le rivage, Que quelques vilains troupeaux, Suivis de nymphes de
village, Qui les escortent sans sabots--â€™

â€˜A truce, dear Fergus! spare us those most tedious and insipid persons of
all Arcadia. Do not, for Heavenâ€™s sake, bring down Coridon and Lindor
upon us.â€™

â€˜Nay, if you cannot relish la houlette et le chalumeau, have with you in
heroic strains.â€™

â€˜Dear Fergus, you have certainly partaken of the inspiration of
Mac-Murroughâ€™s cup rather than of mine.â€™

â€˜I disclaim it, ma belle demoiselle, although I protest it would be the
more congenial of the two. Which of your crack-brained Italian romancers
is it that says,
                               Io dâ€™Elicona niente
    Mi curo, in fe de Dio; cheâ€™l bere dâ€™acque
    (Bea chi ber ne vuol) sempre mi spiacque!
[Footnote:
    Good sooth, I reck nought of your Helicon;
    Drink water whoso will, in faith I will drink none.]
But if you prefer the Gaelic, Captain Waverley, here is little Cathleen
shall sing you Drimmindhu. Come, Cathleen, astore (i.e. my dear), begin;
no apologies to the cean-kinne.â€™

Cathleen sung with much liveliness a little Gaelic song, the burlesque
elegy of a countryman on the loss of his cow, the comic tones of which,
though he did not understand the language, made Waverley laugh more than
once. [Footnote: This ancient Gaelic ditty is still well known, both in
the Highlands and in Ireland It was translated into English, and
published, if I mistake not, under the auspices of the facetious Tom
Dâ€™Urfey, by the title of â€˜Colley, my Cow.â€™]

â€˜Admirable, Cathleen!â€™ cried the Chieftain; â€˜I must find you a handsome
husband among the clansmen one of these days.â€™

Cathleen laughed, blushed, and sheltered herself behind her companion.

In the progress of their return to the castle, the Chieftain warmly
pressed Waverley to remain for a week or two, in order to see a grand
hunting party, in which he and some other Highland gentlemen proposed to
join. The charms of melody and beauty were too strongly impressed in
Edwardâ€™s breast to permit his declining an invitation so pleasing. It was
agreed, therefore, that he should write a note to the Baron of
Bradwardine, expressing his intention to stay a fortnight at
Glennaquoich, and requesting him to forward by the bearer (a gilly of the
Chieftainâ€™s) any letters which might have arrived for him.

This turned the discourse upon the Baron, whom Fergus highly extolled as
a gentleman and soldier. His character was touched with yet more
discrimination by Flora, who observed he was the very model of the old
Scottish cavalier, with all his excellencies and peculiarities. â€˜It is a
character, Captain Waverley, which is fast disappearing; for its best
point was a self-respect which was never lost sight of till now. But in
the present time the gentlemen whose principles do not permit them to pay
court to the existing government are neglected and degraded, and many
conduct themselves accordingly; and, like some of the persons you have
seen at Tully-Veolan, adopt habits and companions inconsistent with their
birth and breeding. The ruthless proscription of party seems to degrade
the victims whom it brands, however unjustly. But let us hope a brighter
day is approaching, when a Scottish country gentleman may be a scholar
without the pedantry of our friend the Baron, a sportsman without the low
habits of Mr. Falconer, and a judicious improver of his property without
becoming a boorish two-legged steer like Killancureit.â€™

Thus did Flora prophesy a revolution, which time indeed has produced, but
in a manner very different from what she had in her mind.

The amiable Rose was next mentioned, with the warmest encomium on her
person, manners, and mind. â€˜That man,â€™ said Flora, â€˜will find an
inestimable treasure in the affections of Rose Bradwardine who shall be
so fortunate as to become their object. Her very soul is in home, and in
the discharge of all those quiet virtues of which home is the centre. Her
husband will be to her what her father now is, the object of all her
care, solicitude, and affection. She will see nothing, and connect
herself with nothing, but by him and through him. If he is a man of sense
and virtue, she will sympathise in his sorrows, divert his fatigue, and
share his pleasures. If she becomes the property of a churlish or
negligent husband, she will suit his taste also, for she will not long
survive his unkindness. And, alas! how great is the chance that some such
unworthy lot may be that of my poor friend! O that I were a queen this
moment, and could command the most amiable and worthy youth of my kingdom
to accept happiness with the hand of Rose Bradwardine!â€™

â€˜I wish you would command her to accept mine en attendant,â€™ said Fergus,
laughing.

I donâ€™t know by what caprice it was that this wish, however jocularly
expressed, rather jarred on Edwardâ€™s feelings, notwithstanding his
growing inclination to Flora and his indifference to Miss Bradwardine.
This is one of the inexplicabilities of human nature, which we leave
without comment.

â€˜Yours, brother?â€™ answered Flora, regarding him steadily. â€˜No; you have
another bride--Honour; and the dangers you must run in pursuit of her
rival would break poor Roseâ€™s heart.â€™

With this discourse they reached the castle, and Waverley soon prepared
his despatches for Tully-Veolan. As he knew the Baron was punctilious in
such matters, he was about to impress his billet with a seal on which his
armorial bearings were engraved, but he did not find it at his watch, and
thought he must have left it at Tully-Veolan. He mentioned his loss,
borrowing at the same time the family seal of the Chieftain.

â€˜Surely,â€™ said Miss Mac-Ivor, â€˜Donald Bean Lean would not--â€™

â€˜My life for him in such circumstances,â€™ answered her brother; â€˜besides,
he would never have left the watch behind.â€™

â€˜After all, Fergus,â€™ said Flora, â€˜and with every allowance, I am
surprised you can countenance that man.â€™

â€˜I countenance him? This kind sister of mine would persuade you, Captain
Waverley, that I take what the people of old used to call â€œa steakraid,â€
 that is, a â€œcollop of the foray,â€ or, in plainer words, a portion of the
robberâ€™s booty, paid by him to the Laird, or Chief, through whose grounds
he drove his prey. O, it is certain that, unless I can find some way to
charm Floraâ€™s tongue, General Blakeney will send a sergeantâ€™s party from
Stirling (this he said with haughty and emphatic irony) to seize Vich Ian
Vohr, as they nickname me, in his own castle.â€™

â€˜Now, Fergus, must not our guest be sensible that all this is folly and
affectation? You have men enough to serve you without enlisting banditti,
and your own honour is above taint. Why donâ€™t you send this Donald Bean
Lean, whom I hate for his smoothness and duplicity even more than for his
rapine, out of your country at once? No cause should induce me to
tolerate such a character.â€™

â€˜No cause, Flora?â€™ said the Chieftain significantly.

â€˜No cause, Fergus! not even that which is nearest to my heart. Spare it
the omen of such evil supporters!â€™

â€˜O but, sister,â€™ rejoined the Chief gaily, â€˜you donâ€™t consider my respect
for la belle passion. Evan Dhu Maccombich is in love with Donaldâ€™s
daughter, Alice, and you cannot expect me to disturb him in his amours.
Why, the whole clan would cry shame on me. You know it is one of their
wise sayings, that a kinsman is part of a manâ€™s body, but a
foster-brother is a piece of his heart.â€™

â€˜Well, Fergus, there is no disputing with you; but I would all this may
end well.â€™

â€˜Devoutly prayed, my dear and prophetic sister, and the best way in the
world to close a dubious argument. But hear ye not the pipes, Captain
Waverley? Perhaps you will like better to dance to them in the hall than
to be deafened with their harmony without taking part in the exercise
they invite us to.â€™

Waverley took Floraâ€™s hand. The dance, song, and merry-making proceeded,
and closed the dayâ€™s entertainment at the castle of Vich Ian Vohr. Edward
at length retired, his mind agitated by a variety of new and conflicting
feelings, which detained him from rest for some time, in that not
unpleasing state of mind in which fancy takes the helm, and the soul
rather drifts passively along with the rapid and confused tide of
reflections than exerts itself to encounter, systematise, or examine
them. At a late hour he fell asleep, and dreamed of Flora Mac-Ivor.




CHAPTER XXIV

A STAG-HUNT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES


Shall this be a long or a short chapter? This is a question in which you,
gentle reader, have no vote, however much you may be interested in the
consequences; just as you may (like myself) probably have nothing to do
with the imposing a new tax, excepting the trifling circumstance of being
obliged to pay it. More happy surely in the present case, since, though
it lies within my arbitrary power to extend my materials as I think
proper, I cannot call you into Exchequer if you do not think proper to
read my narrative. Let me therefore consider. It is true that the annals
and documents in my hands say but little of this Highland chase; but then
I can find copious materials for description elsewhere. There is old
Lindsay of Pitscottie ready at my elbow, with his Athole hunting, and his
â€˜lofted and joisted palace of green timber; with all kind of drink to be
had in burgh and land, as ale, beer, wine, muscadel, malvaise, hippocras,
and aquavitae; with wheat-bread, main-bread, ginge-bread, beef, mutton,
lamb, veal, venison, goose, grice, capon, coney, crane, swan, partridge,
plover, duck, drake, brisselcock, pawnies, black-cock, muir-fowl, and
capercailziesâ€™; not forgetting the â€˜costly bedding, vaiselle, and napry,â€™
and least of all the â€˜excelling stewards, cunning baxters, excellent
cooks, and pottingars, with confections and drugs for the desserts.â€™
Besides the particulars which may be thence gleaned for this Highland
feast (the splendour of which induced the Popeâ€™s legate to dissent from
an opinion which he had hitherto held, that Scotland, namely, was
the--the--the latter end of the world)--besides these, might I not
illuminate my pages with Taylor the Water Poetâ€™s hunting in the Braes of
Mar, where,--

    Through heather, mosse, â€˜mong frogs, and bogs, and fogs,
      â€˜Mongst craggy cliffs and thunder-batterâ€™d hills,
    Hares, hinds, bucks, roes, are chased by men and dogs,
      Where two hoursâ€™ hunting fourscore fat deer kills.
    Lowland, your sports are low as is your seat;
    The Highland games and minds are high and great?

But without further tyranny over my readers, or display of the extent of
my own reading, I shall content myself with borrowing a single incident
from the memorable hunting at Lude, commemorated in the ingenious Mr.
Gunnâ€™s essay on the Caledonian Harp, and so proceed in my story with all
the brevity that my natural style of composition, partaking of what
scholars call the periphrastic and ambagitory, and the vulgar the
circumbendibus, will permit me.

The solemn hunting was delayed, from various causes, for about three
weeks. The interval was spent by Waverley with great satisfaction at
Glennaquoich; for the impression which Flora had made on his mind at
their first meeting grew daily stronger. She was precisely the character
to fascinate a youth of romantic imagination. Her manners, her language,
her talents for poetry and music, gave additional and varied influence to
her eminent personal charms. Even in her hours of gaiety she was in his
fancy exalted above the ordinary daughters of Eve, and seemed only to
stoop for an instant to those topics of amusement and gallantry which
others appear to live for. In the neighbourhood of this enchantress,
while sport consumed the morning and music and the dance led on the hours
of evening, Waverley became daily more delighted with his hospitable
landlord, and more enamoured of his bewitching sister.

At length the period fixed for the grand hunting arrived, and Waverley
and the Chieftain departed for the place of rendezvous, which was a dayâ€™s
journey to the northward of Glennaquoich. Fergus was attended on this
occasion by about three hundred of his clan, well armed and accoutred in
their best fashion. Waverley complied so far with the custom of the
country as to adopt the trews (he could not be reconciled to the kilt),
brogues, and bonnet, as the fittest dress for the exercise in which he
was to be engaged, and which least exposed him to be stared at as a
stranger when they should reach the place of rendezvous. They found on
the spot appointed several powerful Chiefs, to all of whom Waverley was
formally presented, and by all cordially received. Their vassals and
clansmen, a part of whose feudal duty it was to attend on these parties,
appeared in such numbers as amounted to a small army. These active
assistants spread through the country far and near, forming a circle,
technically called the tinchel, which, gradually closing, drove the deer
in herds together towards the glen where the Chiefs and principal
sportsmen lay in wait for them. In the meanwhile these distinguished
personages bivouacked among the flowery heath, wrapped up in their
plaids, a mode of passing a summerâ€™s night which Waverley found by no
means unpleasant.

For many hours after sunrise the mountain ridges and passes retained
their ordinary appearance of silence and solitude, and the Chiefs, with
their followers, amused themselves with various pastimes, in which the
joys of the shell, as Ossian has it, were not forgotten. â€˜Others apart
sate on a hill retired,â€™ probably as deeply engaged in the discussion of
politics and news as Miltonâ€™s spirits in metaphysical disquisition. At
length signals of the approach of the game were descried and heard.
Distant shouts resounded from valley to valley, as the various parties of
Highlanders, climbing rocks, struggling through copses, wading brooks,
and traversing thickets, approached more and more near to each other, and
compelled the astonished deer, with the other wild animals that fled
before them, into a narrower circuit. Every now and then the report of
muskets was heard, repeated by a thousand echoes. The baying of the dogs
was soon added to the chorus, which grew ever louder and more loud. At
length the advanced parties of the deer began to show themselves; and as
the stragglers came bounding down the pass by two or three at a time, the
Chiefs showed their skill by distinguishing the fattest deer, and their
dexterity in bringing them down with their guns. Fergus exhibited
remarkable address, and Edward was also so fortunate as to attract the
notice and applause of the sportsmen.

But now the main body of the deer appeared at the head of the glen,
compelled into a very narrow compass, and presenting such a formidable
phalanx that their antlers appeared at a distance, over the ridge of the
steep pass, like a leafless grove. Their number was very great, and from
a desperate stand which they made, with the tallest of the red-deer stags
arranged in front, in a sort of battle-array, gazing on the group which
barred their passage down the glen, the more experienced sportsmen began
to augur danger. The work of destruction, however, now commenced on all
sides. Dogs and hunters were at work, and muskets and fusees resounded
from every quarter. The deer, driven to desperation, made at length a
fearful charge right upon the spot where the more distinguished sportsmen
had taken their stand. The word was given in Gaelic to fling themselves
upon their faces; but Waverley, on whose English ears the signal was
lost, had almost fallen a sacrifice to his ignorance of the ancient
language in which it was communicated. Fergus, observing his danger,
sprung up and pulled him with violence to the ground, just as the whole
herd broke down upon them. The tide being absolutely irresistible, and
wounds from a stagâ€™s horn highly dangerous, the activity of the Chieftain
may be considered, on this occasion, as having saved his guestâ€™s life. He
detained him with a firm grasp until the whole herd of deer had fairly
run over them. Waverley then attempted to rise, but found that he had
suffered several very severe contusions, and, upon a further examination,
discovered that he had sprained his ankle violently.

[Footnote: The thrust from the tynes, or branches, of the stagâ€™s horns
was accounted far more dangerous than those of the boarâ€™s tusk:--

    If thou be hurt with horn of stag,
    it brings thee to thy bier,
    But barberâ€™s hand shall boarâ€™s hurt heal,
    thereof have thou no fear.]

This checked the mirth of the meeting, although the Highlanders,
accustomed to such incidents, and prepared for them, had suffered no harm
themselves. A wigwam was erected almost in an instant, where Edward was
deposited on a couch of heather. The surgeon, or he who assumed the
office, appeared to unite the characters of a leech and a conjuror. He
was an old smoke-dried Highlander, wearing a venerable grey beard, and
having for his sole garment a tartan frock, the skirts of which descended
to the knee, and, being undivided in front, made the vestment serve at
once for doublet and breeches. [Footnote: This garb, which resembled the
dress often put on children in Scotland, called a polonie (i. e.
polonaise), is a very ancient modification of the Highland garb. It was,
in fact, the hauberk or shirt of mail, only composed of cloth instead of
rings of armour.] He observed great ceremony in approaching Edward; and
though our hero was writhing with pain, would not proceed to any
operation which might assuage it until he had perambulated his couch
three times, moving from east to west, according to the course of the
sun. This, which was called making the deasil, [Footnote: Old Highlanders
will still make the deasil around those whom they wish well to. To go
round a person in the opposite direction, or withershins (German
wider-shins), is unlucky, and a sort of incantation.] both the leech and
the assistants seemed to consider as a matter of the last importance to
the accomplishment of a cure; and Waverley, whom pain rendered incapable
of expostulation, and who indeed saw no chance of its being attended to,
submitted in silence.

After this ceremony was duly performed, the old Esculapius let his
patientâ€™s blood with a cupping-glass with great dexterity, and proceeded,
muttering all the while to himself in Gaelic, to boil on the fire certain
herbs, with which he compounded an embrocation. He then fomented the
parts which had sustained injury, never failing to murmur prayers or
spells, which of the two Waverley could not distinguish, as his ear only
caught the words Gaspar-Melchior-Balthazar-max-prax-fax, and similar
gibberish. The fomentation had a speedy effect in alleviating the pain
and swelling, which our hero imputed to the virtue of the herbs or the
effect of the chafing, but which was by the bystanders unanimously
ascribed to the spells with which the operation had been accompanied.
Edward was given to understand that not one of the ingredients had been
gathered except during the full moon, and that the herbalist had, while
collecting them, uniformly recited a charm, which in English ran thus:--

    Hail to thee, thou holy herb,
    That sprung on holy ground!
    All in the Mount Olivet
    First wert thou found.
    Thou art boot for many a bruise,
    And healest many a wound;
    In our Ladyâ€™s blessed name,
    I take thee from the ground.

[Footnote: This metrical spell, or something very like it, is preserved
by Reginald Scott in his work on Witchcraft.]

Edward observed with some surprise that even Fergus, notwithstanding his
knowledge and education, seemed to fall in with the superstitious ideas
of his countrymen, either because he deemed it impolitic to affect
scepticism on a matter of general belief, or more probably because, like
most men who do not think deeply or accurately on such subjects, he had
in his mind a reserve of superstition which balanced the freedom of his
expressions and practice upon other occasions. Waverley made no
commentary, therefore, on the manner of the treatment, but rewarded the
professor of medicine with a liberality beyond the utmost conception of
his wildest hopes. He uttered on the occasion so many incoherent
blessings in Gaelic and English that Mac-Ivor, rather scandalised at the
excess of his acknowledgments, cut them short by exclaiming, Ceud mile
mhalloich ort! i.e. â€˜A hundred thousand curses on you!â€™ and so pushed the
helper of men out of the cabin.

After Waverley was left alone, the exhaustion of pain and fatigue--for
the whole dayâ€™s exercise had been severe--threw him into a profound, but
yet a feverish sleep, which he chiefly owed to an opiate draught
administered by the old Highlander from some decoction of herbs in his
pharmacopoeia.

Early the next morning, the purpose of their meeting being over, and
their sports damped by the untoward accident, in which Fergus and all his
friends expressed the greatest sympathy, it became a question how to
dispose of the disabled sportsman. This was settled by Mac-Ivor, who had
a litter prepared, of â€˜birch and hazel-grey,â€™

[FOOTNOTE:
    On the morrow they made their biers
    Of birch and hazel grey. Chevy Chase.]
which was borne by his people with such caution and dexterity as renders
it not improbable that they may have been the ancestors of some of those
sturdy Gael who have now the happiness to transport the belles of
Edinburgh in their sedan-chairs to ten routs in one evening. When Edward
was elevated upon their shoulders he could not help being gratified with
the romantic effect produced by the breaking up of this sylvan camp.
[Footnote: See Note 25.]

The various tribes assembled, each at the pibroch of their native clan,
and each headed by their patriarchal ruler. Some, who had already begun
to retire, were seen winding up the hills, or descending the passes which
led to the scene of action, the sound of their bagpipes dying upon the
ear. Others made still a moving picture upon the narrow plain, forming
various changeful groups, their feathers and loose plaids waving in the
morning breeze, and their arms glittering in the rising sun. Most of the
Chiefs came to take farewell of Waverley, and to express their anxious
hope they might again, and speedily, meet; but the care of Fergus
abridged the ceremony of taking leave. At length, his own men being
completely assembled and mustered, Mac-Ivor commenced his march, but not
towards the quarter from which they had come. He gave Edward to
understand that the greater part of his followers now on the field were
bound on a distant expedition, and that when he had deposited him in the
house of a gentleman, who he was sure would pay him every attention, he
himself should be under the necessity of accompanying them the greater
part of the way, but would lose no time in rejoining his friend.

Waverley was rather surprised that Fergus had not mentioned this ulterior
destination when they set out upon the hunting-party; but his situation
did not admit of many interrogatories. The greater part of the clansmen
went forward under the guidance of old Ballenkeiroch and Evan Dhu
Maccombich, apparently in high spirits. A few remained for the purpose of
escorting the Chieftain, who walked by the side of Edwardâ€™s litter, and
attended him with the most affectionate assiduity. About noon, after a
journey which the nature of the conveyance, the pain of his bruises, and
the roughness of the way rendered inexpressibly painful, Waverley was
hospitably received into the house of a gentleman related to Fergus, who
had prepared for him every accommodation which the simple habits of
living then universal in the Highlands put in his power. In this person,
an old man about seventy, Edward admired a relic of primitive simplicity.
He wore no dress but what his estate afforded; the cloth was the fleece
of his own sheep, woven by his own servants, and stained into tartan by
the dyes produced from the herbs and lichens of the hills around him. His
linen was spun by his daughters and maidservants, from his own flax; nor
did his table, though plentiful, and varied with game and fish, offer an
article but what was of native produce.

Claiming himself no rights of clanship or vassalage, he was fortunate in
the alliance and protection of Vich Ian Vohr and other bold and
enterprising Chieftains, who protected him in the quiet unambitious life
he loved. It is true, the youth born on his grounds were often enticed to
leave him for the service of his more active friends; but a few old
servants and tenants used to shake their grey locks when they heard their
master censured for want of spirit, and observed, â€˜When the wind is
still, the shower falls soft.â€™ This good old man, whose charity and
hospitality were unbounded, would have received Waverley with kindness
had he been the meanest Saxon peasant, since his situation required
assistance. But his attention to a friend and guest of Vich Ian Vohr was
anxious and unremitted. Other embrocations were applied to the injured
limb, and new spells were put in practice. At length, after more
solicitude than was perhaps for the advantage of his health, Fergus took
farewell of Edward for a few days, when, he said, he would return to
Tomanrait, and hoped by that time Waverley would be able to ride one of
the Highland ponies of his landlord, and in that manner return to
Glennaquoich.

The next day, when his good old host appeared, Edward learned that his
friend had departed with the dawn, leaving none of his followers except
Callum Beg, the sort of foot-page who used to attend his person, and who
had now in charge to wait upon Waverley. On asking his host if he knew
where the Chieftain was gone, the old man looked fixedly at him, with
something mysterious and sad in the smile which was his only reply.
Waverley repeated his question, to which his host answered in a
proverb,--

    What sent the messengers to hell,
    Was asking what they knew full well.

[Footnote: Corresponding to the Lowland saying, â€˜Mony ane speirs the gate
they ken fuâ€™ weel.â€™]

He was about to proceed, but Callum Beg said, rather pertly, as Edward
thought, that â€˜Ta Tighearnach (i.e. the Chief) did not like ta Sassenagh
duinhe-wassel to be pingled wiâ€™ mickle speaking, as she was na tat weel.â€™
From this Waverley concluded he should disoblige his friend by inquiring
of a stranger the object of a journey which he himself had not
communicated.

It is unnecessary to trace the progress of our heroâ€™s recovery. The sixth
morning had arrived, and he was able to walk about with a staff, when
Fergus returned with about a score of his men. He seemed in the highest
spirits, congratulated Waverley on his progress towards recovery, and
finding he was able to sit on horseback, proposed their immediate return
to Glennaquoich. Waverley joyfully acceded, for the form of its fair
mistress had lived in his dreams during all the time of his confinement.

Now he has ridden oâ€™er moor and moss, Oâ€™er hill and many a glen,

Fergus, all the while, with his myrmidons, striding stoutly by his side,
or diverging to get a shot at a roe or a heath-cock. Waverleyâ€™s bosom
beat thick when they approached the old tower of Ian nan Chaistel, and
could distinguish the fair form of its mistress advancing to meet them.

Fergus began immediately, with his usual high spirits, to exclaim, â€˜Open
your gates, incomparable princess, to the wounded Moor Abindarez, whom
Rodrigo de Narvez, constable of Antiquera, conveys to your castle; or
open them, if you like it better, to the renowned Marquis of Mantua, the
sad attendant of his half-slain friend Baldovinos of the Mountain. Ah,
long rest to thy soul, Cervantes! without quoting thy remnants, how
should I frame my language to befit romantic ears!â€™

Flora now advanced, and welcoming Waverley with much kindness, expressed
her regret for his accident, of which she had already heard particulars,
and her surprise that her brother should not have taken better care to
put a stranger on his guard against the perils of the sport in which he
engaged him. Edward easily exculpated the Chieftain, who, indeed, at his
own personal risk, had probably saved his life.

This greeting over, Fergus said three or four words to his sister in
Gaelic. The tears instantly sprung to her eyes, but they seemed to be
tears of devotion and joy, for she looked up to heaven and folded her
hands as in a solemn expression of prayer or gratitude. After the pause
of a minute, she presented to Edward some letters which had been
forwarded from Tully-Veolan during his absence, and at the same time
delivered some to her brother. To the latter she likewise gave three or
four numbers of the Caledonian Mercury, the only newspaper which was then
published to the north of the Tweed.

Both gentlemen retired to examine their despatches, and Edward speedily
found that those which he had received contained matters of very deep
interest.




CHAPTER XXV

NEWS FROM ENGLAND


The letters which Waverley had hitherto received from his relations in
England were not such as required any particular notice in this
narrative. His father usually wrote to him with the pompous affectation
of one who was too much oppressed by public affairs to find leisure to
attend to those of his own family. Now and then he mentioned persons of
rank in Scotland to whom he wished his son should pay some attention; but
Waverley, hitherto occupied by the amusements which he had found at
Tully-Veolan and Glennaquoich, dispensed with paying any attention to
hints so coldly thrown out, especially as distance, shortness of leave of
absence, and so forth furnished a ready apology. But latterly the burden
of Mr. Richard Waverleyâ€™s paternal epistles consisted in certain
mysterious hints of greatness and influence which he was speedily to
attain, and which would ensure his sonâ€™s obtaining the most rapid
promotion, should he remain in the military service. Sir Everardâ€™s
letters were of a different tenor. They were short; for the good Baronet
was none of your illimitable correspondents, whose manuscript overflows
the folds of their large post paper, and leaves no room for the seal; but
they were kind and affectionate, and seldom concluded without some
allusion to our heroâ€™s stud, some question about the state of his purse,
and a special inquiry after such of his recruits as had preceded him from
Waverley-Honour. Aunt Rachel charged him to remember his principles of
religion, to take care of his health, to beware of Scotch mists, which,
she had heard, would wet an Englishman through and through, never to go
out at night without his great-coat, and, above all, to wear flannel next
to his skin.

Mr. Pembroke only wrote to our hero one letter, but it was of the bulk of
six epistles of these degenerate days, containing, in the moderate
compass of ten folio pages, closely written, a precis of a supplementary
quarto manuscript of addenda, delenda, et corrigenda in reference to the
two tracts with which he had presented Waverley. This he considered as a
mere sop in the pan to stay the appetite of Edwardâ€™s curiosity until he
should find an opportunity of sending down the volume itself, which was
much too heavy for the post, and which he proposed to accompany with
certain interesting pamphlets, lately published by his friend in Little
Britain, with whom he had kept up a sort of literary correspondence, in
virtue of which the library shelves of Waverley-Honour were loaded with
much trash, and a good round bill, seldom summed in fewer than three
figures, was yearly transmitted, in which Sir Everard Waverley of
Waverley-Honour, Bart., was marked Dr. to Jonathan Grubbet, bookseller
and stationer, Little Britain. Such had hitherto been the style of the
letters which Edward had received from England; but the packet delivered
to him at Glennaquoich was of a different and more interesting
complexion. It would be impossible for the reader, even were I to insert
the letters at full length, to comprehend the real cause of their being
written, without a glance into the interior of the British cabinet at the
period in question.

The ministers of the day happened (no very singular event) to be divided
into two parties; the weakest of which, making up by assiduity of
intrigue their inferiority in real consequence, had of late acquired some
new proselytes, and with them the hope of superseding their rivals in the
favour of their sovereign, and overpowering them in the House of Commons.
Amongst others, they had thought it worth while to practise upon Richard
Waverley. This honest gentleman, by a grave mysterious demeanour, an
attention to the etiquette of business rather more than to its essence, a
facility in making long dull speeches, consisting of truisms and
commonplaces, hashed up with a technical jargon of office, which
prevented the inanity of his orations from being discovered, had acquired
a certain name and credit in public life, and even established, with
many, the character of a profound politician; none of your shining
orators, indeed, whose talents evaporate in tropes of rhetoric and
flashes of wit, but one possessed of steady parts for business, which
would wear well, as the ladies say in choosing their silks, and ought in
all reason to be good for common and every-day use, since they were
confessedly formed of no holiday texture.

This faith had become so general that the insurgent party in the cabinet,
of which we have made mention, after sounding Mr. Richard Waverley, were
so satisfied with his sentiments and abilities as to propose that, in
case of a certain revolution in the ministry, he should take an
ostensible place in the new order of things, not indeed of the very first
rank, but greatly higher, in point both of emolument and influence, than
that which he now enjoyed. There was no resisting so tempting a proposal,
notwithstanding that the Great Man under whose patronage he had enlisted,
and by whose banner he had hitherto stood firm, was the principal object
of the proposed attack by the new allies. Unfortunately this fair scheme
of ambition was blighted in the very bud by a premature movement. All the
official gentlemen concerned in it who hesitated to take the part of a
voluntary resignation were informed that the king had no further occasion
for their services; and in Richard Waverleyâ€™s case, which the minister
considered as aggravated by ingratitude, dismissal was accompanied by
something like personal contempt and contumely. The public, and even the
party of whom he shared the fall, sympathised little in the
disappointment of this selfish and interested statesman; and he retired
to the country under the comfortable reflection that he had lost, at the
same time, character, credit, and,--what he at least equally
deplored,--emolument.

Richard Waverleyâ€™s letter to his son upon this occasion was a masterpiece
of its kind. Aristides himself could not have made out a harder case. An
unjust monarch and an ungrateful country were the burden of each rounded
paragraph. He spoke of long services and unrequited sacrifices; though
the former had been overpaid by his salary, and nobody could guess in
what the latter consisted, unless it were in his deserting, not from
conviction, but for the lucre of gain, the Tory principles of his family.
In the conclusion, his resentment was wrought to such an excess by the
force of his own oratory, that he could not repress some threats of
vengeance, however vague and impotent, and finally acquainted his son
with his pleasure that he should testify his sense of the ill-treatment
he had sustained by throwing up his commission as soon as the letter
reached him. This, he said, was also his uncleâ€™s desire, as he would
himself intimate in due course.

Accordingly, the next letter which Edward opened was from Sir Everard.
His brotherâ€™s disgrace seemed to have removed from his well-natured bosom
all recollection of their differences, and, remote as he was from every
means of learning that Richardâ€™s disgrace was in reality only the just as
well as natural consequence of his own unsuccessful intrigues, the good
but credulous Baronet at once set it down as a new and enormous instance
of the injustice of the existing government. It was true, he said, and he
must not disguise it even from Edward, that his father could not have
sustained such an insult as was now, for the first time, offered to one
of his house, unless he had subjected himself to it by accepting of an
employment under the present system. Sir Everard had no doubt that he now
both saw and felt the magnitude of this error, and it should be his (Sir
Everardâ€™s) business to take care that the cause of his regret should not
extend itself to pecuniary consequences. It was enough for a Waverley to
have sustained the public disgrace; the patrimonial injury could easily
be obviated by the head of their family. But it was both the opinion of
Mr. Richard Waverley and his own that Edward, the representative of the
family of Waverley-Honour, should not remain in a situation which
subjected him also to such treatment as that with which his father had
been stigmatised. He requested his nephew therefore to take the fittest,
and at the same time the most speedy, opportunity of transmitting his
resignation to the War Office, and hinted, moreover, that little ceremony
was necessary where so little had been used to his father. He sent
multitudinous greetings to the Baron of Bradwardine.

A letter from Aunt Rachel spoke out even more plainly. She considered the
disgrace of brother Richard as the just reward of his forfeiting his
allegiance to a lawful though exiled sovereign, and taking the oaths to
an alien; a concession which her grandfather, Sir Nigel Waverley, refused
to make, either to the Roundhead Parliament or to Cromwell, when his life
and fortune stood in the utmost extremity. She hoped her dear Edward
would follow the footsteps of his ancestors, and as speedily as possible
get rid of the badge of servitude to the usurping family, and regard the
wrongs sustained by his father as an admonition from Heaven that every
desertion of the line of loyalty becomes its own punishment. She also
concluded with her respects to Mr. Bradwardine, and begged Waverley would
inform her whether his daughter, Miss Rose, was old enough to wear a pair
of very handsome ear-rings, which she proposed to send as a token of her
affection. The good lady also desired to be informed whether Mr.
Bradwardine took as much Scotch snuff and danced as unweariedly as he did
when he was at Waverley-Honour about thirty years ago.

These letters, as might have been expected, highly excited Waverleyâ€™s
indignation. From the desultory style of his studies, he had not any
fixed political opinion to place in opposition to the movements of
indignation which he felt at his fatherâ€™s supposed wrongs. Of the real
cause of his disgrace Edward was totally ignorant; nor had his habits at
all led him to investigate the politics of the period in which he lived,
or remark the intrigues in which his father had been so actively engaged.
Indeed, any impressions which he had accidentally adopted concerning the
parties of the times were (owing to the society in which he had lived at
Waverley-Honour) of a nature rather unfavourable to the existing
government and dynasty. He entered, therefore, without hesitation into
the resentful feeling of the relations who had the best title to dictate
his conduct, and not perhaps the less willingly when he remembered the
tedium of his quarters, and the inferior figure which he had made among
the officers of his regiment. If he could have had any doubt upon the
subject it would have been decided by the following letter from his
commanding officer, which, as it is very short, shall be inserted
verbatim:--

SIR,--

Having carried somewhat beyond the line of my duty an indulgence which
even the lights of nature, and much more those of Christianity, direct
towards errors which may arise from youth and inexperience, and that
altogether without effect, I am reluctantly compelled, at the present
crisis, to use the only remaining remedy which is in my power. You are,
therefore, hereby commanded to repair to ----, the headquarters of the
regiment, within three days after the date of this letter. If you shall
fail to do so, I must report you to the War Office as absent without
leave, and also take other steps, which will be disagreeable to you as
well as to,

Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

J. GARDINER, Lieut.-Col.

Commanding the----Regt. Dragoons.

Edwardâ€™s blood boiled within him as he read this letter. He had been
accustomed from his very infancy to possess in a great measure the
disposal of his own time, and thus acquired habits which rendered the
rules of military discipline as unpleasing to him in this as they were in
some other respects. An idea that in his own case they would not be
enforced in a very rigid manner had also obtained full possession of his
mind, and had hitherto been sanctioned by the indulgent conduct of his
lieutenant-colonel. Neither had anything occurred, to his knowledge, that
should have induced his commanding officer, without any other warning
than the hints we noticed at the end of the fourteenth chapter, so
suddenly to assume a harsh and, as Edward deemed it, so insolent a tone
of dictatorial authority. Connecting it with the letters he had just
received from his family, he could not but suppose that it was designed
to make him feel, in his present situation, the same pressure of
authority which had been exercised in his fatherâ€™s case, and that the
whole was a concerted scheme to depress and degrade every member of the
Waverley family.

Without a pause, therefore, Edward wrote a few cold lines, thanking his
lieutenant-colonel for past civilities, and expressing regret that he
should have chosen to efface the remembrance of them by assuming a
different tone towards him. The strain of his letter, as well as what he
(Edward) conceived to be his duty in the present crisis, called upon him
to lay down his commission; and he therefore inclosed the formal
resignation of a situation which subjected him to so unpleasant a
correspondence, and requested Colonel Gardiner would have the goodness to
forward it to the proper authorities.

Having finished this magnanimous epistle, he felt somewhat uncertain
concerning the terms in which his resignation ought to be expressed, upon
which subject he resolved to consult Fergus Mac-Ivor. It may be observed
in passing that the bold and prompt habits of thinking, acting, and
speaking which distinguished this young Chieftain had given him a
considerable ascendency over the mind of Waverley. Endowed with at least
equal powers of understanding, and with much finer genius, Edward yet
stooped to the bold and decisive activity of an intellect which was
sharpened by the habit of acting on a preconceived and regular system, as
well as by extensive knowledge of the world.

When Edward found his friend, the latter had still in his hand the
newspaper which he had perused, and advanced to meet him with the
embarrassment of one who has unpleasing news to communicate. â€˜Do your
letters, Captain Waverley, confirm the unpleasing information which I
find in this paper?â€™

He put the paper into his hand, where his fatherâ€™s disgrace was
registered in the most bitter terms, transferred probably from some
London journal. At the end of the paragraph was this remarkable
innuendo:--

â€˜We understand that â€œthis same RICHARD who hath done all thisâ€ is not the
only example of the WAVERING HONOUR of W-v-r-ly H-n-r. See the Gazette of
this day.â€™

With hurried and feverish apprehension our hero turned to the place
referred to, and found therein recorded, â€˜Edward Waverley, captain
in----regiment dragoons, superseded for absence without leaveâ€™; and in
the list of military promotions, referring to the same regiment, he
discovered this farther article, â€˜Lieut. Julius Butler, to be captain,
VICE Edward Waverley, superseded.â€™

Our heroâ€™s bosom glowed with the resentment which undeserved and
apparently premeditated insult was calculated to excite in the bosom of
one who had aspired after honour, and was thus wantonly held up to public
scorn and disgrace. Upon comparing the date of his colonelâ€™s letter with
that of the article in the Gazette, he perceived that his threat of
making a report upon his absence had been literally fulfilled, and
without inquiry, as it seemed, whether Edward had either received his
summons or was disposed to comply with it. The whole, therefore, appeared
a formed plan to degrade him in the eyes of the public; and the idea of
its having succeeded filled him with such bitter emotions that, after
various attempts to conceal them, he at length threw himself into
Mac-Ivorâ€™s arms, and gave vent to tears of shame and indignation.

It was none of this Chieftainâ€™s faults to be indifferent to the wrongs of
his friends; and for Edward, independent of certain plans with which he
was connected, he felt a deep and sincere interest. The proceeding
appeared as extraordinary to him as it had done to Edward. He indeed knew
of more motives than Waverley was privy to for the peremptory order that
he should join his regiment. But that, without further inquiry into the
circumstances of a necessary delay, the commanding officer, in
contradiction to his known and established character, should have
proceeded in so harsh and unusual a manner was a mystery which he could
not penetrate. He soothed our hero, however, to the best of his power,
and began to turn his thoughts on revenge for his insulted honour.

Edward eagerly grasped at the idea. â€˜Will you carry a message for me to
Colonel Gardiner, my dear Fergus, and oblige me for ever?â€™

Fergus paused. â€˜It is an act of friendship which you should command,
could it be useful, or lead to the righting your honour; but in the
present case I doubt if your commanding officer would give you the
meeting on account of his having taken measures which, however harsh and
exasperating, were still within the strict bounds of his duty. Besides,
Gardiner is a precise Huguenot, and has adopted certain ideas about the
sinfulness of such rencontres, from which it would be impossible to make
him depart, especially as his courage is beyond all suspicion. And
besides, I--I, to say the truth--I dare not at this moment, for some very
weighty reasons, go near any of the military quarters or garrisons
belonging to this government.â€™

â€˜And am I,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜to sit down quiet and contented under the
injury I have received?â€™

â€˜That will I never advise my friend,â€™ replied Mac-Ivor. â€˜But I would have
vengeance to fall on the head, not on the hand, on the tyrannical and
oppressive government which designed and directed these premeditated and
reiterated insults, not on the tools of office which they employed in the
execution of the injuries they aimed at you.â€™

â€˜On the government!â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜Yes,â€™ replied the impetuous Highlander, â€˜on the usurping House of
Hanover, whom your grandfather would no more have served than he would
have taken wages of red-hot gold from the great fiend of hell!â€™

â€˜But since the time of my grandfather two generations of this dynasty
have possessed the throne,â€™ said Edward coolly.

â€˜True,â€™ replied the Chieftain; â€˜and because we have passively given them
so long the means of showing their native character,--because both you
and I myself have lived in quiet submission, have even truckled to the
times so far as to accept commissions under them, and thus have given
them an opportunity of disgracing us publicly by resuming them, are we
not on that account to resent injuries which our fathers only
apprehended, but which we have actually sustained? Or is the cause of the
unfortunate Stuart family become less just, because their title has
devolved upon an heir who is innocent of the charges of misgovernment
brought against his father? Do you remember the lines of your favourite
poet?

    Had Richard unconstrainâ€™d resignâ€™d the throne,
    A king can give no more than is his own;
    The title stood entailâ€™d had Richard had a son.

You see, my dear Waverley, I can quote poetry as well as Flora and you.
But come, clear your moody brow, and trust to me to show you an
honourable road to a speedy and glorious revenge. Let us seek Flora, who
perhaps has more news to tell us of what has occurred during our absence.
She will rejoice to hear that you are relieved of your servitude. But
first add a postscript to your letter, marking the time when you received
this calvinistical colonelâ€™s first summons, and express your regret that
the hastiness of his proceedings prevented your anticipating them by
sending your resignation. Then let him blush for his injustice.â€™

The letter was sealed accordingly, covering a formal resignation of the
commission, and Mac-Ivor despatched it with some letters of his own by a
special messenger, with charge to put them into the nearest post-office
in the Lowlands.




CHAPTER XXVI

AN ECLAIRCISSEMENT


The hint which the Chieftain had thrown out respecting Flora was not
unpremeditated. He had observed with great satisfaction the growing
attachment of Waverley to his sister, nor did he see any bar to their
union, excepting the situation which Waverleyâ€™s father held in the
ministry, and Edwardâ€™s own commission in the army of George II. These
obstacles were now removed, and in a manner which apparently paved the
way for the sonâ€™s becoming reconciled to another allegiance. In every
other respect the match would be most eligible. The safety, happiness,
and honourable provision of his sister, whom he dearly loved, appeared to
be ensured by the proposed union; and his heart swelled when he
considered how his own interest would be exalted in the eyes of the
ex-monarch to whom he had dedicated his service, by an alliance with one
of those ancient, powerful, and wealthy English families of the steady
cavalier faith, to awaken whose decayed attachment to the Stuart family
was now a matter of such vital importance to the Stuart cause. Nor could
Fergus perceive any obstacle to such a scheme. Waverleyâ€™s attachment was
evident; and as his person was handsome, and his taste apparently
coincided with her own, he anticipated no opposition on the part of
Flora. Indeed, between his ideas of patriarchal power and those which he
had acquired in France respecting the disposal of females in marriage,
any opposition from his sister, dear as she was to him, would have been
the last obstacle on which he would have calculated, even had the union
been less eligible.

Influenced by these feelings, the Chief now led Waverley in quest of Miss
Mac-Ivor, not without the hope that the present agitation of his guestâ€™s
spirits might give him courage to cut short what Fergus termed the
romance of the courtship. They found Flora, with her faithful attendants,
Una and Cathleen, busied in preparing what appeared to Waverley to be
white bridal favours. Disguising as well as he could the agitation of his
mind, Waverley asked for what joyful occasion Miss Mac-Ivor made such
ample preparation.

â€˜It is for Fergusâ€™s bridal,â€™ she said, smiling.

â€˜Indeed!â€™ said Edward; â€˜he has kept his secret well. I hope he will allow
me to be his brideâ€™s-man.â€™

â€˜That is a manâ€™s office, but not yours, as Beatrice says,â€™ retorted
Flora.

â€˜And who is the fair lady, may I be permitted to ask, Miss Mac-Ivor?â€™

â€˜Did not I tell you long since that Fergus wooed no bride but Honour?â€™
answered Flora.

â€˜And am I then incapable of being his assistant and counsellor in the
pursuit of honour?â€™ said our hero, colouring deeply. â€˜Do I rank so low in
your opinion?â€™

â€˜Far from it, Captain Waverley. I would to God you were of our
determination! and made use of the expression which displeased you,
solely

    Because you are not of our quality,
    But stand against us as an enemy.â€™

â€˜That time is past, sister,â€™ said Fergus; â€˜and you may wish Edward
Waverley (no longer captain) joy of being freed from the slavery to an
usurper, implied in that sable and ill-omened emblem.â€™

â€˜Yes,â€™ said Waverley, undoing the cockade from his hat, â€˜it has pleased
the king who bestowed this badge upon me to resume it in a manner which
leaves me little reason to regret his service.â€™

â€˜Thank God for that!â€™ cried the enthusiast; â€˜and O that they may be blind
enough to treat every man of honour who serves them with the same
indignity, that I may have less to sigh for when the struggle
approaches!â€™

â€˜And now, sister,â€™ said the Chieftain, â€˜replace his cockade with one of a
more lively colour. I think it was the fashion of the ladies of yore to
arm and send forth their knights to high achievement.â€™

â€˜Not,â€™ replied the lady, â€˜till the knight adventurer had well weighed the
justice and the danger of the cause, Fergus. Mr. Waverley is just now too
much agitated by feelings of recent emotion for me to press upon him a
resolution of consequence.â€™

Waverley felt half alarmed at the thought of adopting the badge of what
was by the majority of the kingdom esteemed rebellion, yet he could not
disguise his chagrin at the coldness with which Flora parried her
brotherâ€™s hint. â€˜Miss Mac-Ivor, I perceive, thinks the knight unworthy of
her encouragement and favour,â€™ said he, somewhat bitterly.

â€˜Not so, Mr. Waverley,â€™ she replied, with great sweetness. â€˜Why should I
refuse my brotherâ€™s valued friend a boon which I am distributing to his
whole clan? Most willingly would I enlist every man of honour in the
cause to which my brother has devoted himself. But Fergus has taken his
measures with his eyes open. His life has been devoted to this cause from
his cradle; with him its call is sacred, were it even a summons to the
tomb. But how can I wish you, Mr. Waverley, so new to the world, so far
from every friend who might advise and ought to influence you,--in a
moment, too, of sudden pique and indignation,--how can I wish you to
plunge yourself at once into so desperate an enterprise?â€™

Fergus, who did not understand these delicacies, strode through the
apartment biting his lip, and then, with a constrained smile, said,
â€˜Well, sister, I leave you to act your new character of mediator between
the Elector of Hanover and the subjects of your lawful sovereign and
benefactor,â€™ and left the room.

There was a painful pause, which was at length broken by Miss Mac-Ivor.
â€˜My brother is unjust,â€™ she said, â€˜because he can bear no interruption
that seems to thwart his loyal zeal.â€™

â€˜And do you not share his ardour?â€™ asked Waverley,

â€˜Do I not?â€™ answered Flora. â€˜God knows mine exceeds his, if that be
possible. But I am not, like him, rapt by the bustle of military
preparation, and the infinite detail necessary to the present
undertaking, beyond consideration of the grand principles of justice and
truth, on which our enterprise is grounded; and these, I am certain, can
only be furthered by measures in themselves true and just. To operate
upon your present feelings, my dear Mr. Waverley, to induce you to an
irretrievable step, of which you have not considered either the justice
or the danger, is, in my poor judgment, neither the one nor the other.â€™

â€˜Incomparable Flora!â€™ said Edward, taking her hand, â€˜how much do I need
such a monitor!â€™

â€˜A better one by far,â€™ said Flora, gently withdrawing her hand, â€˜Mr.
Waverley will always find in his own bosom, when he will give its small
still voice leisure to be heard.â€™

â€˜No, Miss Mac-Ivor, I dare not hope it; a thousand circumstances of fatal
self-indulgence have made me the creature rather of imagination than
reason. Durst I but hope--could I but think--that you would deign to be
to me that affectionate, that condescending friend, who would strengthen
me to redeem my errors, my future life--â€™

â€˜Hush, my dear sir! now you carry your joy at escaping the hands of a
Jacobite recruiting officer to an unparalleled excess of gratitude.â€™

â€˜Nay, dear Flora, trifle with me no longer; you cannot mistake the
meaning of those feelings which I have almost involuntarily expressed;
and since I have broken the barrier of silence, let me profit by my
audacity. Or may I, with your permission, mention to your brother--â€™

â€˜Not for the world, Mr. Waverley!â€™

â€˜What am I to understand?â€™ said Edward. â€˜Is there any fatal bar--has any
prepossession--â€™

â€˜None, sir,â€™ answered Flora. â€˜I owe it to myself to say that I never yet
saw the person on whom I thought with reference to the present subject.â€™

â€˜The shortness of our acquaintance, perhaps--If Miss Mac-Ivor will deign
to give me time--â€™

â€˜I have not even that excuse. Captain Waverleyâ€™s character is so
open--is, in short, of that nature that it cannot be misconstrued, either
in its strength or its weakness.â€™

â€˜And for that weakness you despise me?â€™ said Edward.

â€˜Forgive me, Mr. Waverley--and remember it is but within this half hour
that there existed between us a barrier of a nature to me insurmountable,
since I never could think of an officer in the service of the Elector of
Hanover in any other light than as a casual acquaintance. Permit me then
to arrange my ideas upon so unexpected a topic, and in less than an hour
I will be ready to give you such reasons for the resolution I shall
express as may be satisfactory at least, if not pleasing to you.â€™ So
saying Flora withdrew, leaving Waverley to meditate upon the manner in
which she had received his addresses.

Ere he could make up his mind whether to believe his suit had been
acceptable or no, Fergus re-entered the apartment. â€˜What, a la mort,
Waverley?â€™ he cried. â€˜Come down with me to the court, and you shall see a
sight worth all the tirades of your romances. An hundred firelocks, my
friend, and as many broadswords, just arrived from good friends; and two
or three hundred stout fellows almost fighting which shall first possess
them. But let me look at you closer. Why, a true Highlander would say you
had been blighted by an evil eye. Or can it be this silly girl that has
thus blanked your spirit. Never mind her, dear Edward; the wisest of her
sex are fools in what regards the business of life.â€™

â€˜Indeed, my good friend,â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜all that I can charge
against your sister is, that she is too sensible, too reasonable.â€™

â€˜If that be all, I ensure you for a louis-dâ€™or against the mood lasting
four-and-twenty hours. No woman was ever steadily sensible for that
period; and I will engage, if that will please you, Flora shall be as
unreasonable to-morrow as any of her sex. You must learn, my dear Edward,
to consider women en mousquetaire.â€™ So saying, he seized Waverleyâ€™s arm
and dragged him off to review his military preparations.




CHAPTER XXVII

UPON THE SAME SUBJECT


Fergus Mac-Ivor had too much tact and delicacy to renew the subject which
he had interrupted. His head was, or appeared to be, so full of guns,
broadswords, bonnets, canteens, and tartan hose that Waverley could not
for some time draw his attention to any other topic.

â€˜Are you to take the field so soon, Fergus,â€™ he asked, â€˜that you are
making all these martial preparations?â€™

â€˜When we have settled that you go with me, you shall know all; but
otherwise, the knowledge might rather be prejudicial to you.â€™

â€˜But are you serious in your purpose, with such inferior forces, to rise
against an established government? It is mere frenzy.â€™

â€˜Laissez faire a Don Antoine; I shall take good care of myself. We shall
at least use the compliment of Conan, who never got a stroke but he gave
one. I would not, however,â€™ continued the Chieftain, â€˜have you think me
mad enough to stir till a favourable opportunity: I will not slip my dog
before the gameâ€™s afoot. But, once more, will you join with us, and you
shall know all?â€™

â€˜How can I?â€™ said Waverley; â€˜I, who have so lately held that commission
which is now posting back to those that gave it? My accepting it implied
a promise of fidelity, and an acknowledgment of the legality of the
government.â€™

â€˜A rash promise,â€™ answered Fergus, â€˜is not a steel handcuff, it may be
shaken off, especially when it was given under deception, and has been
repaid by insult. But if you cannot immediately make up your mind to a
glorious revenge, go to England, and ere you cross the Tweed you will
hear tidings that will make the world ring; and if Sir Everard be the
gallant old cavalier I have heard him described by some of our HONEST
gentlemen of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, he will
find you a better horse-troop and a better cause than you have lost.â€™

â€˜But your sister, Fergus?â€™

â€˜Out, hyperbolical fiend!â€™ replied the Chief, laughing; â€˜how vexest thou
this man! Speakâ€™st thou of nothing but of ladies?â€™

â€˜Nay, be serious, my dear friend,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜I feel that the
happiness of my future life must depend upon the answer which Miss
Mac-Ivor shall make to what I ventured to tell her this morning.â€™

â€˜And is this your very sober earnest,â€™ said Fergus, more gravely, â€˜or are
we in the land of romance and fiction?â€™

â€˜My earnest, undoubtedly. How could you suppose me jesting on such a
subject?â€™

â€˜Then, in very sober earnest,â€™ answered his friend, â€˜I am very glad to
hear it; and so highly do I think of Flora, that you are the only man in
England for whom I would say so much. But before you shake my hand so
warmly, there is more to be considered. Your own family--will they
approve your connecting yourself with the sister of a high-born Highland
beggar?â€™

â€˜My uncleâ€™s situation,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜his general opinions, and his
uniform indulgence, entitle me to say, that birth and personal qualities
are all he would look to in such a connection. And where can I find both
united in such excellence as in your sister?â€™

â€˜O nowhere! cela va sans dire,â€™ replied Fergus, with a smile. â€˜But your
father will expect a fatherâ€™s prerogative in being consulted.â€™

â€˜Surely; but his late breach with the ruling powers removes all
apprehension of objection on his part, especially as I am convinced that
my uncle will be warm in my cause.â€™

â€˜Religion perhaps,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜may make obstacles, though we are not
bigotted Catholics.â€™

â€˜My grandmother was of the Church of Rome, and her religion was never
objected to by my family. Do not think of MY friends, dear Fergus; let me
rather have your influence where it may be more necessary to remove
obstacles--I mean with your lovely sister.â€™

â€˜My lovely sister,â€™ replied Fergus, â€˜like her loving brother, is very apt
to have a pretty decisive will of her own, by which, in this case, you
must be ruled; but you shall not want my interest, nor my counsel. And,
in the first place, I will give you one hint--Loyalty is her ruling
passion; and since she could spell an English book she has been in love
with the memory of the gallant Captain Wogan, who renounced the service
of the usurper Cromwell to join the standard of Charles II, marched a
handful of cavalry from London to the Highlands to join Middleton, then
in arms for the king, and at length died gloriously in the royal cause.
Ask her to show you some verses she made on his history and fate; they
have been much admired, I assure you. The next point is--I think I saw
Flora go up towards the waterfall a short time since; follow, man,
follow! donâ€™t allow the garrison time to strengthen its purposes of
resistance. Alerte a la muraille! Seek Flora out, and learn her decision
as soon as you can, and Cupid go with you, while I go to look over belts
and cartouch-boxes.â€™

Waverley ascended the glen with an anxious and throbbing heart. Love,
with all its romantic train of hopes, fears, and wishes, was mingled with
other feelings of a nature less easily defined. He could not but remember
how much this morning had changed his fate, and into what a complication
of perplexity it was likely to plunge him. Sunrise had seen him possessed
of an esteemed rank in the honourable profession of arms, his father to
all appearance rapidly rising in the favour of his sovereign. All this
had passed away like a dream: he himself was dishonoured, his father
disgraced, and he had become involuntarily the confidant at least, if not
the accomplice, of plans, dark, deep, and dangerous, which must infer
either the subversion of the government he had so lately served or the
destruction of all who had participated in them. Should Flora even listen
to his suit favourably, what prospect was there of its being brought to a
happy termination amid the tumult of an impending insurrection? Or how
could he make the selfish request that she should leave Fergus, to whom
she was so much attached, and, retiring with him to England, wait, as a
distant spectator, the success of her brotherâ€™s undertaking, or the ruin
of all his hopes and fortunes? Or, on the other hand, to engage himself,
with no other aid than his single arm, in the dangerous and precipitate
counsels of the Chieftain, to be whirled along by him, the partaker of
all his desperate and impetuous motions, renouncing almost the power of
judging, or deciding upon the rectitude or prudence of his actions, this
was no pleasing prospect for the secret pride of Waverley to stoop to.
And yet what other conclusion remained, saving the rejection of his
addresses by Flora, an alternative not to be thought of in the present
high-wrought state of his feelings with anything short of mental agony.
Pondering the doubtful and dangerous prospect before him, he at length
arrived near the cascade, where, as Fergus had augured, he found Flora
seated.

She was quite alone, and as soon as she observed his approach she rose
and came to meet him. Edward attempted to say something within the verge
of ordinary compliment and conversation, but found himself unequal to the
task. Flora seemed at first equally embarrassed, but recovered herself
more speedily, and (an unfavourable augury for Waverleyâ€™s suit) was the
first to enter upon the subject of their last interview. â€˜It is too
important, in every point of view, Mr. Waverley, to permit me to leave
you in doubt on my sentiments.â€™

â€˜Do not speak them speedily,â€™ said Waverley, much agitated, â€˜unless they
are such as I fear, from your manner, I must not dare to anticipate. Let
time--let my future conduct--let your brotherâ€™s influence--â€™

â€˜Forgive me, Mr. Waverley,â€™ said Flora, her complexion a little
heightened, but her voice firm and composed. â€˜I should incur my own heavy
censure did I delay expressing my sincere conviction that I can never
regard you otherwise than as a valued friend. I should do you the highest
injustice did I conceal my sentiments for a moment. I see I distress you,
and I grieve for it, but better now than later; and O, better a thousand
times, Mr. Waverley, that you should feel a present momentary
disappointment than the long and heart-sickening griefs which attend a
rash and ill-assorted marriage!â€™

â€˜Good God!â€™ exclaimed Waverley, â€˜why should you anticipate such
consequences from a union where birth is equal, where fortune is
favourable, where, if I may venture to say so, the tastes are similar,
where you allege no preference for another, where you even express a
favourable opinion of him whom you reject?â€™

â€˜Mr. Waverley, I HAVE that favourable opinion,â€™ answered Flora; â€˜and so
strongly that, though I would rather have been silent on the grounds of
my resolution, you shall command them, if you exact such a mark of my
esteem and confidence.â€™

She sat down upon a fragment of rock, and Waverley, placing himself near
her, anxiously pressed for the explanation she offered.

â€˜I dare hardly,â€™ she said, â€˜tell you the situation of my feelings, they
are so different from those usually ascribed to young women at my period
of life; and I dare hardly touch upon what I conjecture to be the nature
of yours, lest I should give offence where I would willingly administer
consolation. For myself, from my infancy till this day I have had but one
wish--the restoration of my royal benefactors to their rightful throne.
It is impossible to express to you the devotion of my feelings to this
single subject; and I will frankly confess that it has so occupied my
mind as to exclude every thought respecting what is called my own
settlement in life. Let me but live to see the day of that happy
restoration, and a Highland cottage, a French convent, or an English
palace will be alike indifferent to me.â€™

â€˜But, dearest Flora, how is your enthusiastic zeal for the exiled family
inconsistent with my happiness?â€™

â€˜Because you seek, or ought to seek, in the object of your attachment a
heart whose principal delight should be in augmenting your domestic
felicity and returning your affection, even to the height of romance. To
a man of less keen sensibility, and less enthusiastic tenderness of
disposition, Flora Mac-Ivor might give content, if not happiness; for,
were the irrevocable words spoken, never would she be deficient in the
duties which she vowed.â€™

â€˜And why,--why, Miss Mac-Ivor, should you think yourself a more valuable
treasure to one who is less capable of loving, of admiring you, than to
me?â€™

â€˜Simply because the tone of our affections would be more in unison, and
because his more blunted sensibility would not require the return of
enthusiasm which I have not to bestow. But you, Mr. Waverley, would for
ever refer to the idea of domestic happiness which your imagination is
capable of painting, and whatever fell short of that ideal representation
would be construed into coolness and indifference, while you might
consider the enthusiasm with which I regarded the success of the royal
family as defrauding your affection of its due return.â€™

â€˜In other words, Miss Mac-Ivor, you cannot love me?â€™ said her suitor
dejectedly.

â€˜I could esteem you, Mr. Waverley, as much, perhaps more, than any man I
have ever seen; but I cannot love you as you ought to be loved. O! do
not, for your own sake, desire so hazardous an experiment! The woman whom
you marry ought to have affections and opinions moulded upon yours. Her
studies ought to be your studies; her wishes, her feelings, her hopes,
her fears, should all mingle with yours. She should enhance your
pleasures, share your sorrows, and cheer your melancholy.â€™

â€˜And why will not you, Miss Mac-Ivor, who can so well describe a happy
union, why will not you be yourself the person you describe?â€™

â€˜Is it possible you do not yet comprehend me?â€™ answered Flora. â€˜Have I
not told you that every keener sensation of my mind is bent exclusively
towards an event upon which, indeed, I have no power but those of my
earnest prayers?â€™

â€˜And might not the granting the suit I solicit,â€™ said Waverley, too
earnest on his purpose to consider what he was about to say, â€˜even
advance the interest to which you have devoted yourself? My family is
wealthy and powerful, inclined in principles to the Stuart race, and
should a favourable opportunity--â€™

â€˜A favourable opportunity!â€™ said Flora--somewhat scornfully. â€˜Inclined in
principles! Can such lukewarm adherence be honourable to yourselves, or
gratifying to your lawful sovereign? Think, from my present feelings,
what I should suffer when I held the place of member in a family where
the rights which I hold most sacred are subjected to cold discussion, and
only deemed worthy of support when they shall appear on the point of
triumphing without it!â€™

â€˜Your doubts,â€™ quickly replied Waverley, â€˜are unjust as far as concerns
myself. The cause that I shall assert, I dare support through every
danger, as undauntedly as the boldest who draws sword in its behalf.â€™

â€˜Of that,â€™ answered Flora, â€˜I cannot doubt for a moment. But consult your
own good sense and reason rather than a prepossession hastily adopted,
probably only because you have met a young woman possessed of the usual
accomplishments in a sequestered and romantic situation. Let your part in
this great and perilous drama rest upon conviction, and not on a hurried
and probably a temporary feeling.â€™

Waverley attempted to reply, but his words failed him. Every sentiment
that Flora had uttered vindicated the strength of his attachment; for
even her loyalty, although wildly enthusiastic, was generous and noble,
and disdained to avail itself of any indirect means of supporting the
cause to which she was devoted.

After walking a little way in silence down the path, Flora thus resumed
the conversation.--â€˜One word more, Mr. Waverley, ere we bid farewell to
this topic for ever; and forgive my boldness if that word have the air of
advice. My brother Fergus is anxious that you should join him in his
present enterprise. But do not consent to this; you could not, by your
single exertions, further his success, and you would inevitably share his
fall, if it be Godâ€™s pleasure that fall he must. Your character would
also suffer irretrievably. Let me beg you will return to your own
country; and, having publicly freed yourself from every tie to the
usurping government, I trust you will see cause, and find opportunity, to
serve your injured sovereign with effect, and stand forth, as your loyal
ancestors, at the head of your natural followers and adherents, a worthy
representative of the house of Waverley.â€™

â€˜And should I be so happy as thus to distinguish myself, might I not
hope--â€™

â€˜Forgive my interruption,â€™ said Flora. â€˜The present time only is ours,
and I can but explain to you with candour the feelings which I now
entertain; how they might be altered by a train of events too favourable
perhaps to be hoped for, it were in vain even to conjecture. Only be
assured, Mr. Waverley, that, after my brotherâ€™s honour and happiness,
there is none which I shall more sincerely pray for than for yours.â€™

With these words she parted from him, for they were now arrived where two
paths separated. Waverley reached the castle amidst a medley of
conflicting passions. He avoided any private interview with Fergus, as he
did not find himself able either to encounter his raillery or reply to
his solicitations. The wild revelry of the feast, for Mac-Ivor kept open
table for his clan, served in some degree to stun reflection. When their
festivity was ended, he began to consider how he should again meet Miss
Mac-Ivor after the painful and interesting explanation of the morning.
But Flora did not appear. Fergus, whose eyes flashed when he was told by
Cathleen that her mistress designed to keep her apartment that evening,
went himself in quest of her; but apparently his remonstrances were in
vain, for he returned with a heightened complexion and manifest symptoms
of displeasure. The rest of the evening passed on without any allusion,
on the part either of Fergus or Waverley, to the subject which engrossed
the reflections of the latter, and perhaps of both.

When retired to his own apartment, Edward endeavoured to sum up the
business of the day. That the repulse he had received from Flora would be
persisted in for the present, there was no doubt. But could he hope for
ultimate success in case circumstances permitted the renewal of his suit?
Would the enthusiastic loyalty, which at this animating moment left no
room for a softer passion, survive, at least in its engrossing force, the
success or the failure of the present political machinations? And if so,
could he hope that the interest which she had acknowledged him to possess
in her favour might be improved into a warmer attachment? He taxed his
memory to recall every word she had used, with the appropriate looks and
gestures which had enforced them, and ended by finding himself in the
same state of uncertainty. It was very late before sleep brought relief
to the tumult of his mind, after the most painful and agitating day which
he had ever passed.




CHAPTER XXVIII

A LETTER FROM TULLY-VEOLAN


In the morning, when Waverleyâ€™s troubled reflections had for some time
given way to repose, there came music to his dreams, but not the voice of
Selma. He imagined himself transported back to Tully-Veolan, and that he
heard Davie Gellatley singing in the court those matins which used
generally to be the first sounds that disturbed his repose while a guest
of the Baron of Bradwardine. The notes which suggested this vision
continued, and waxed louder, until Edward awoke in earnest. The illusion,
however, did not seem entirely dispelled. The apartment was in the
fortress of Ian nan Chaistel, but it was still the voice of Davie
Gellatley that made the following lines resound under the window:--

    My heartâ€™s in the Highlands, my heart is not here,
    My heartâ€™s in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;
    A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
    My heartâ€™s in the Highlands wherever I go.

[Footnote: These lines form the burden of an old song to which Burns
wrote additional verses.]

Curious to know what could have determined Mr. Gellatley on an excursion
of such unwonted extent, Edward began to dress himself in all haste,
during which operation the minstrelsy of Davie changed its tune more than
once:--

    Thereâ€™s nought in the Highlands but syboes and leeks,
    And lang-leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks,
    Wanting the breeks, and without hose and shoon,
    But weâ€™ll aâ€™win the breeks when King Jamie comes hame.

[Footnote: These lines are also ancient, and I believe to the tune of
â€˜Weâ€™ll never hae peace till Jamie comes hame,â€™ to which Burns likewise
wrote some verses.]

By the time Waverley was dressed and had issued forth, David had
associated himself with two or three of the numerous Highland loungers
who always graced the gates of the castle with their presence, and was
capering and dancing full merrily in the doubles and full career of a
Scotch foursome reel, to the music of his own whistling. In this double
capacity of dancer and musician he continued, until an idle piper, who
observed his zeal, obeyed the unanimous call of seid suas (i.e. blow up),
and relieved him from the latter part of his trouble. Young and old then
mingled in the dance as they could find partners. The appearance of
Waverley did not interrupt Davidâ€™s exercise, though he contrived, by
grinning, nodding, and throwing one or two inclinations of the body into
the graces with which he performed the Highland fling, to convey to our
hero symptoms of recognition. Then, while busily employed in setting,
whooping all the while, and snapping his fingers over his head, he of a
sudden prolonged his side-step until it brought him to the place where
Edward was standing, and, still keeping time to the music like Harlequin
in a pantomime, he thrust a letter into our heroâ€™s hand, and continued
his saltation without pause or intermission. Edward, who perceived that
the address was in Roseâ€™s hand-writing, retired to peruse it, leaving the
faithful bearer to continue his exercise until the piper or he should be
tired out.

The contents of the letter greatly surprised him. It had originally
commenced with â€˜Dear Sirâ€™; but these words had been carefully erased, and
the monosyllable â€˜Sirâ€™ substituted in their place. The rest of the
contents shall be given in Roseâ€™s own language.

I fear I am using an improper freedom by intruding upon you, yet I cannot
trust to any one else to let you know some things which have happened
here, with which it seems necessary you should be acquainted. Forgive me,
if I am wrong in what I am doing; for, alas! Mr. Waverley, I have no
better advice than that of my own feelings; my dear father is gone from
this place, and when he can return to my assistance and protection, God
alone knows. You have probably heard that, in consequence of some
troublesome news from the Highlands, warrants were sent out for
apprehending several gentlemen in these parts, and, among others, my dear
father. In spite of all my tears and entreaties that he would surrender
himself to the government, he joined with Mr. Falconer and some other
gentlemen, and they have all gone northwards, with a body of about forty
horsemen. So I am not so anxious concerning his immediate safety as about
what may follow afterwards, for these troubles are only beginning. But
all this is nothing to you, Mr. Waverley, only I thought you would be
glad to learn that my father has escaped, in case you happen to have
heard that he was in danger.

The day after my father went off there came a party of soldiers to
Tully-Veolan, and behaved very rudely to Bailie Macwheeble; but the
officer was very civil to me, only said his duty obliged him to search
for arms and papers. My father had provided against this by taking away
all the arms except the old useless things which hung in the hall, and he
had put all his papers out of the way. But O! Mr. Waverley, how shall I
tell you, that they made strict inquiry after you, and asked when you had
been at Tully-Veolan, and where you now were. The officer is gone back
with his party, but a non-commissioned officer and four men remain as a
sort of garrison in the house. They have hitherto behaved very well, as
we are forced to keep them in good-humour. But these soldiers have hinted
as if, on your falling into their hands, you would be in great danger; I
cannot prevail on myself to write what wicked falsehoods they said, for I
am sure they are falsehoods; but you will best judge what you ought to
do. The party that returned carried off your servant prisoner, with your
two horses, and everything that you left at Tully-Veolan. I hope God will
protect you, and that you will get safe home to England, where you used
to tell me there was no military violence nor fighting among clans
permitted, but everything was done according to an equal law that
protected all who were harmless and innocent. I hope you will exert your
indulgence as to my boldness in writing to you, where it seems to me,
though perhaps erroneously, that your safety and honour are concerned. I
am sure--at least I think, my father would approve of my writing; for Mr.
Rubrick is fled to his cousinâ€™s at the Duchran, to to be out of danger
from the soldiers and the Whigs, and Bailie Macwheeble does not like to
meddle (he says) in other menâ€™s concerns, though I hope what may serve my
fatherâ€™s friend at such a time as this cannot be termed improper
interference. Farewell, Captain Waverley! I shall probably never see you
more; for it would be very improper to wish you to call at Tully-Veolan
just now, even if these men were gone; but I will always remember with
gratitude your kindness in assisting so poor a scholar as myself, and
your attentions to my dear, dear father.

I remain, your obliged servant,

ROSE COMYNE BRADWARDINE.

P.S.--I hope you will send me a line by David Gellatley, just to say you
have received this and that you will take care of yourself; and forgive
me if I entreat you, for your own sake, to join none of these unhappy
cabals, but escape, as fast as possible, to your own fortunate country.
My compliments to my dear Flora and to Glennaquoich. Is she not as
handsome and accomplished as I have described her?

Thus concluded the letter of Rose Bradwardine, the contents of which both
surprised and affected Waverley. That the Baron should fall under the
suspicions of government, in consequence of the present stir among the
partisans of the house of Stuart, seemed only the natural consequence of
his political predilections; but how HE himself should have been involved
in such suspicions, conscious that until yesterday he had been free from
harbouring a thought against the prosperity of the reigning family,
seemed inexplicable. Both at Tully-Veolan and Glennaquoich his hosts had
respected his engagements with the existing government, and though enough
passed by accidental innuendo that might induce him to reckon the Baron
and the Chief among those disaffected gentlemen who were still numerous
in Scotland, yet until his own connection with the army had been broken
off by the resumption of his commission, he had no reason to suppose that
they nourished any immediate or hostile attempts against the present
establishment. Still he was aware that, unless he meant at once to
embrace the proposal of Fergus Mac-Ivor, it would deeply concern him to
leave the suspicious neighbourhood without delay, and repair where his
conduct might undergo a satisfactory examination. Upon this he the rather
determined, as Floraâ€™s advice favoured his doing so, and because he felt
inexpressible repugnance at the idea of being accessary to the plague of
civil war. Whatever were the original rights of the Stuarts, calm
reflection told him that, omitting the question how far James the Second
could forfeit those of his posterity, he had, according to the united
voice of the whole nation, justly forfeited his own. Since that period
four monarchs had reigned in peace and glory over Britain, sustaining and
exalting the character of the nation abroad and its liberties at home.
Reason asked, was it worth while to disturb a government so long settled
and established, and to plunge a kingdom into all the miseries of civil
war, for the purpose of replacing upon the throne the descendants of a
monarch by whom it had been wilfully forfeited? If, on the other hand,
his own final conviction of the goodness of their cause, or the commands
of his father or uncle, should recommend to him allegiance to the
Stuarts, still it was necessary to clear his own character by showing
that he had not, as seemed to be falsely insinuated, taken any step to
this purpose during his holding the commission of the reigning monarch.

The affectionate simplicity of Rose and her anxiety for his safety, his
sense too of her unprotected state, and of the terror and actual dangers
to which she might be exposed, made an impression upon his mind, and he
instantly wrote to thank her in the kindest terms for her solicitude on
his account, to express his earnest good wishes for her welfare and that
of her father, and to assure her of his own safety. The feelings which
this task excited were speedily lost in the necessity which he now saw of
bidding farewell to Flora Mac-Ivor, perhaps for ever. The pang attending
this reflection was inexpressible; for her high-minded elevation of
character, her self-devotion to the cause which she had embraced, united
to her scrupulous rectitude as to the means of serving it, had vindicated
to his judgment the choice adopted by his passions. But time pressed,
calumny was busy with his fame, and every hourâ€™s delay increased the
power to injure it. His departure must be instant.

With this determination he sought out Fergus, and communicated to him the
contents of Roseâ€™s letter, with his own resolution instantly to go to
Edinburgh, and put into the hands of some one or other of those persons
of influence to whom he had letters from his father his exculpation from
any charge which might be preferred against him.

â€˜You run your head into the lionâ€™s mouth,â€™ answered Mac-Ivor. â€˜You do not
know the severity of a government harassed by just apprehensions, and a
consciousness of their own illegality and insecurity. I shall have to
deliver you from some dungeon in Stirling or Edinburgh Castle.â€™

â€˜My innocence, my rank, my fatherâ€™s intimacy with Lord M--, General G--,
etc., will be a sufficient protection,â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜You will find the contrary,â€™ replied the Chieftain, â€˜these gentlemen
will have enough to do about their own matters. Once more, will you take
the plaid, and stay a little while with us among the mists and the crows,
in the bravest cause ever sword was drawn in?â€™

[Footnote: A Highland rhyme on Glencairnâ€™s Expedition, in 1650, has these
lines--

      Weâ€™ll bide a while amang ta crows,
      Weâ€™ll wiske ta sword and bend ta bows]

â€˜For many reasons, my dear Fergus, you must hold me excused.â€™

â€˜Well then,â€™ said Mac-Ivor, â€˜I shall certainly find you exerting your
poetical talents in elegies upon a prison, or your antiquarian researches
in detecting the Oggam [Footnote: The Oggam is a species of the old Irish
character. The idea of the correspondence betwixt the Celtic and Punic,
founded on a scene in Plautus, was not started till General Vallancey set
up his theory, long after the date of Fergus Mac-Ivor] character or some
Punic hieroglyphic upon the keystones of a vault, curiously arched. Or
what say you to un petit pendement bien joli? against which awkward
ceremony I donâ€™t warrant you, should you meet a body of the armed
West-Country Whigs.â€™

â€˜And why should they use me so?â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜For a hundred good reasons,â€™ answered Fergus. â€˜First, you are an
Englishman; secondly, a gentleman; thirdly, a prelatist abjured; and,
fourthly, they have not had an opportunity to exercise their talents on
such a subject this long while. But donâ€™t be cast down, beloved; all will
be done in the fear of the Lord.â€™

â€˜Well, I must run my hazard.â€™

â€˜You are determined, then?â€™

â€˜I am.â€™

â€˜Wilful will doâ€™tâ€™ said Fergus. â€˜But you cannot go on foot, and I shall
want no horse, as I must march on foot at the head of the children of
Ivor; you shall have brown Dermid.â€™

â€˜If you will sell him, I shall certainly be much obliged.â€™

â€˜If your proud English heart cannot be obliged by a gift or loan, I will
not refuse money at the entrance of a campaign: his price is twenty
guineas. [Remember, reader, it was Sixty Years Since.] And when do you
propose to depart?â€™

â€˜The sooner the better,â€™ answered Waverley.

â€˜You are right, since go you must, or rather, since go you will. I will
take Floraâ€™s pony and ride with you as far as Bally-Brough. Callum Beg,
see that our horses are ready, with a pony for yourself, to attend and
carry Mr. Waverleyâ€™s baggage as far as--(naming a small town), where he
can have a horse and guide to Edinburgh. Put on a Lowland dress, Callum,
and see you keep your tongue close, if you would not have me cut it out.
Mr. Waverley rides Dermid.â€™ Then turning to Edward, â€˜You will take leave
of my sister?â€™

â€˜Surely--that is, if Miss Mac-Ivor will honour me so far.â€™

â€˜Cathleen, let my sister know Mr. Waverley wishes to bid her farewell
before he leaves us. But Rose Bradwardine, her situation must be thought
of; I wish she were here. And why should she not? There are but four
red-coats at Tully-Veolan, and their muskets would be very useful to us.â€™

To these broken remarks Edward made no answer; his ear indeed received
them, but his soul was intent upon the expected entrance of Flora. The
door opened. It was but Cathleen, with her ladyâ€™s excuse, and wishes for
Captain Waverleyâ€™s health and happiness.




CHAPTER XXIX

WAVERLEYâ€™S RECEPTION IN THE LOWLANDS AFTER HIS HIGHLAND TOUR


It was noon when the two friends stood at the top of the pass of
Bally-Brough. â€˜I must go no farther,â€™ said Fergus Mac-Ivor, who during
the journey had in vain endeavoured to raise his friendâ€™s spirits. â€˜If my
cross-grained sister has any share in your dejection, trust me she thinks
highly of you, though her present anxiety about the public cause prevents
her listening to any other subject. Confide your interest to me; I will
not betray it, providing you do not again assume that vile cockade.â€™

â€˜No fear of that, considering the manner in which it has been recalled.
Adieu, Fergus; do not permit your sister to forget me.â€™

â€˜And adieu, Waverley; you may soon hear of her with a prouder title. Get
home, write letters, and make friends as many and as fast as you can;
there will speedily be unexpected guests on the coast of Suffolk, or my
news from France has deceived me.â€™ [Footnote: The sanguine Jacobites,
during the eventful years 1745-46, kept up the spirits of their party by
the rumour of descents from France on behalf of the Chevalier St.
George.]

Thus parted the friends; Fergus returning back to his castle, while
Edward, followed by Callum Beg, the latter transformed from point to
point into a Low-Country groom, proceeded to the little town of--.

Edward paced on under the painful and yet not altogether embittered
feelings which separation and uncertainty produce in the mind of a
youthful lover. I am not sure if the ladies understand the full value of
the influence of absence, nor do I think it wise to teach it them, lest,
like the Clelias and Mandanes of yore, they should resume the humour of
sending their lovers into banishment. Distance, in truth, produces in
idea the same effect as in real perspective. Objects are softened, and
rounded, and rendered doubly graceful; the harsher and more ordinary
points of character are mellowed down, and those by which it is
remembered are the more striking outlines that mark sublimity, grace, or
beauty. There are mists too in the mental as well as the natural horizon,
to conceal what is less pleasing in distant objects, and there are happy
lights, to stream in full glory upon those points which can profit by
brilliant illumination.

Waverley forgot Flora Mac-Ivorâ€™s prejudices in her magnanimity, and
almost pardoned her indifference towards his affection when he
recollected the grand and decisive object which seemed to fill her whole
soul. She, whose sense of duty so wholly engrossed her in the cause of a
benefactor, what would be her feelings in favour of the happy individual
who should be so fortunate as to awaken them? Then came the doubtful
question, whether he might not be that happy man,--a question which fancy
endeavoured to answer in the affirmative, by conjuring up all she had
said in his praise, with the addition of a comment much more flattering
than the text warranted. All that was commonplace, all that belonged to
the every-day world, was melted away and obliterated in those dreams of
imagination, which only remembered with advantage the points of grace and
dignity that distinguished Flora from the generality of her sex, not the
particulars which she held in common with them. Edward was, in short, in
the fair way of creating a goddess out of a high-spirited, accomplished,
and beautiful young woman; and the time was wasted in castle-building
until, at the descent of a steep hill, he saw beneath him the market-town
of ----.

The Highland politeness of Callum Beg--there are few nations, by the way,
who can boast of so much natural politeness as the Highlanders [Footnote:
The Highlander, in former times, had always a high idea of his own
gentility, and was anxious to impress the same upon those with whom he
conversed. His language abounded in the phrases of courtesy and
compliment; and the habit of carrying arms, and mixing with those who did
so, made it particularly desirable they should use cautious politeness in
their intercourse with each other.]--the Highland civility of his
attendant had not permitted him to disturb the reveries of our hero. But
observing him rouse himself at the sight of the village, Callum pressed
closer to his side, and hoped â€˜when they cam to the public, his honour
wad not say nothing about Vich Ian Vohr, for ta people were bitter Whigs,
deil burst tem.â€™

Waverley assured the prudent page that he would be cautious; and as he
now distinguished, not indeed the ringing of bells, but the tinkling of
something like a hammer against the side of an old mossy, green, inverted
porridge-pot that hung in an open booth, of the size and shape of a
parrotâ€™s cage, erected to grace the east end of a building resembling an
old barn, he asked Callum Beg if it were Sunday.

â€˜Could na say just preceesely; Sunday seldom cam aboon the pass of
Bally-Brough.â€™

On entering the town, however, and advancing towards the most apparent
public-house which presented itself, the numbers of old women, in tartan
screens and red cloaks, who streamed from the barn-resembling building,
debating as they went the comparative merits of the blessed youth Jabesh
Rentowel and that chosen vessel Maister Goukthrapple, induced Callum to
assure his temporary master â€˜that it was either ta muckle Sunday hersell,
or ta little government Sunday that they caâ€™d ta fast.â€™

On alighting at the sign of the Seven-branched Golden Candlestick, which,
for the further delectation of the guests, was graced with a short Hebrew
motto, they were received by mine host, a tall thin puritanical figure,
who seemed to debate with himself whether he ought to give shelter to
those who travelled on such a day. Reflecting, however, in all
probability, that he possessed the power of mulcting them for this
irregularity, a penalty which they might escape by passing into Gregor
Duncansonâ€™s, at the sign of the Highlander and the Hawick Gill, Mr.
Ebenezer Cruickshanks condescended to admit them into his dwelling.

To this sanctified person Waverley addressed his request that he would
procure him a guide, with a saddle-horse, to carry his portmanteau to
Edinburgh.

â€˜And whar may ye be coming from?â€™ demanded mine host of the Candlestick.

â€˜I have told you where I wish to go; I do not conceive any further
information necessary either for the guide or his saddle-horse.â€™

â€˜Hem! Ahem!â€™ returned he of the Candlestick, somewhat disconcerted at
this rebuff. â€˜Itâ€™s the general fast, sir, and I cannot enter into ony
carnal transactions on sic a day, when the people should be humbled and
the backsliders should return, as worthy Mr. Goukthrapple said; and
moreover when, as the precious Mr. Jabesh Rentowel did weel observe, the
land was mourning for covenants burnt, broken, and buried.â€™

â€˜My good friend,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜if you cannot let me have a horse and
guide, my servant shall seek them elsewhere.â€™

â€˜Aweel! Your servant? and what for gangs he not forward wiâ€™ you himsell?â€™

Waverley had but very little of a captain of horseâ€™s spirit within him--I
mean of that sort of spirit which I have been obliged to when I happened,
in a mail coach or diligence, to meet some military man who has kindly
taken upon him the disciplining of the waiters and the taxing of
reckonings. Some of this useful talent our hero had, however, acquired
during his military service, and on this gross provocation it began
seriously to arise. â€˜Look ye, sir; I came here for my own accommodation,
and not to answer impertinent questions. Either say you can, or cannot,
get me what I want; I shall pursue my course in either case.â€™

Mr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks left the room with some indistinct mutterings;
but whether negative or acquiescent, Edward could not well distinguish.
The hostess, a civil, quiet, laborious drudge, came to take his orders
for dinner, but declined to make answer on the subject of the horse and
guide; for the Salique law, it seems, extended to the stables of the
Golden Candlestick.

From a window which overlooked the dark and narrow court in which Callum
Beg rubbed down the horses after their journey, Waverley heard the
following dialogue betwixt the subtle foot-page of Vich Ian Vohr and his
landlord:--

â€˜Yeâ€™ll be frae the north, young man?â€™ began the latter.

â€˜And ye may say that,â€™ answered Callum.

â€˜And yeâ€™ll hae ridden a lang way the day, it may weel be?â€™

â€˜Sae lang, that I could weel tak a dram.â€™

â€˜Gudewife, bring the gill stoup.â€™

Here some compliments passed fitting the occasion, when my host of the
Golden Candlestick, having, as he thought, opened his guestâ€™s heart by
this hospitable propitiation, resumed his scrutiny.

â€˜Yeâ€™ll no hae mickle better whisky than that aboon the Pass?â€™

â€˜I am nae frae aboon the Pass.â€™

â€˜Yeâ€™re a Highlandman by your tongue?â€™

â€˜Na; I am but just Aberdeen-a-way.â€™

â€˜And did your master come frae Aberdeen wiâ€™ you?â€™

â€˜Ay; thatâ€™s when I left it mysell,â€™ answered the cool and impenetrable
Callum Beg.

â€˜And what kind of a gentleman is he?â€™

â€˜I believe he is ane oâ€™ King Georgeâ€™s state officers; at least heâ€™s aye
for ganging on to the south, and he has a hantle siller, and never
grudges onything till a poor body, or in the way of a lawing.â€™

â€˜He wants a guide and a horse frae hence to Edinburgh?â€™

â€˜Ay, and ye maun find it him forthwith.â€™

â€˜Ahem! It will be chargeable.â€™

â€˜He cares na for that a bodle.â€™

â€˜Aweel, Duncan--did ye say your name was Duncan, or Donald?â€™

â€˜Na, man--Jamie--Jamie Steenson--I telt ye before.â€™

This last undaunted parry altogether foiled Mr. Cruickshanks, who, though
not quite satisfied either with the reserve of the master or the extreme
readiness of the man, was contented to lay a tax on the reckoning and
horse-hire that might compound for his ungratified curiosity. The
circumstance of its being the fast day was not forgotten in the charge,
which, on the whole, did not, however, amount to much more than double
what in fairness it should have been.

Callum Beg soon after announced in person the ratification of this
treaty, adding, â€˜Ta auld deevil was ganging to ride wiâ€™ ta duinhe-wassel
hersell.â€™

â€˜That will not be very pleasant, Callum, nor altogether safe, for our
host seems a person of great curiosity; but a traveller must submit to
these inconveniences. Meanwhile, my good lad, here is a trifle for you to
drink Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s health.â€™

The hawkâ€™s eye of Callum flashed delight upon a golden guinea, with which
these last words were accompanied. He hastened, not without a curse on
the intricacies of a Saxon breeches pocket, or spleuchan, as he called
it, to deposit the treasure in his fob; and then, as if he conceived the
benevolence called for some requital on his part, he gathered close up to
Edward, with an expression of countenance peculiarly knowing, and spoke
in an undertone, â€˜If his honour thought ta auld deevil Whig carle was a
bit dangerous, she could easily provide for him, and teil ane ta wiser.â€™

â€˜How, and in what manner?â€™

â€˜Her ain sell,â€™ replied Callum, â€˜could wait for him a wee bit frae the
toun, and kittle his quarters wiâ€™her skene-occle.â€™

â€˜Skene-occle! whatâ€™s that?â€™

Callum unbuttoned his coat, raised his left arm, and, with an emphatic
nod, pointed to the hilt of a small dirk, snugly deposited under it, in
the lining of his jacket. Waverley thought he had misunderstood his
meaning; he gazed in his face, and discovered in Callumâ€™s very handsome
though embrowned features just the degree of roguish malice with which a
lad of the same age in England would have brought forward a plan for
robbing an orchard.

â€˜Good God, Callum, would you take the manâ€™s life?â€™

â€˜Indeed,â€™ answered the young desperado, â€˜and I think he has had just a
lang enough lease o â€˜t, when heâ€™s for betraying honest folk that come to
spend siller at his public.â€™

Edward saw nothing was to be gained by argument, and therefore contented
himself with enjoining Callum to lay aside all practices against the
person of Mr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks; in which injunction the page seemed
to acquiesce with an air of great indifference.

â€˜Ta duinhe-wassel might please himsell; ta auld rudas loon had never done
Callum nae ill. But hereâ€™s a bit line frae ta Tighearna, tat he bade me
gie your honour ere I came back.â€™

The letter from the Chief contained Floraâ€™s lines on the fate of Captain
Wogan, whose enterprising character is so well drawn by Clarendon. He had
originally engaged in the service of the Parliament, but had abjured that
party upon the execution of Charles I; and upon hearing that the royal
standard was set up by the Earl of Glencairn and General Middleton in the
Highlands of Scotland, took leave of Charles II, who was then at Paris,
passed into England, assembled a body of Cavaliers in the neighbourhood
of London, and traversed the kingdom, which had been so long under
domination of the usurper, by marches conducted with such skill,
dexterity, and spirit that he safely united his handful of horsemen with
the body of Highlanders then in arms. After several months of desultory
warfare, in which Woganâ€™s skill and courage gained him the highest
reputation, he had the misfortune to be wounded in a dangerous manner,
and no surgical assistance being within reach he terminated his short but
glorious career.

There were obvious reasons why the politic Chieftain was desirous to
place the example of this young hero under the eye of Waverley, with
whose romantic disposition it coincided so peculiarly. But his letter
turned chiefly upon some trifling commissions which Waverley had promised
to execute for him in England, and it was only toward the conclusion that
Edward found these words: â€˜I owe Flora a grudge for refusing us her
company yesterday; and, as I am giving you the trouble of reading these
lines, in order to keep in your memory your promise to procure me the
fishing-tackle and cross-bow from London, I will enclose her verses on
the Grave of Wogan. This I know will tease her; for, to tell you the
truth, I think her more in love with the memory of that dead hero than
she is likely to be with any living one, unless he shall tread a similar
path. But English squires of our day keep their oak-trees to shelter
their deer parks, or repair the losses of an evening at Whiteâ€™s, and
neither invoke them to wreathe their brows nor shelter their graves. Let
me hope for one brilliant exception in a dear friend, to whom I would
most gladly give a dearer title.â€™

The verses were inscribed,

To an Oak Tree

In the Church-Yard of ----, in the Highlands of Scotland, said to mark
the Grave of Captain Wogan, killed in 1649.

    Emblem of Englandâ€™s ancient faith,
      Full proudly may thy branches wave,
    Where loyalty lies low in death,
      And valour fills a timeless grave.

    And thou, brave tenant of the tomb!
      Repine not if our clime deny,
    Above thine honourâ€™d sod to bloom
      The flowerets of a milder sky.

    These owe their birth to genial May;
      Beneath a fiercer sun they pine,
    Before the winter storm decay;
      And can their worth be type of thine?

    No! for, â€˜mid storms of Fate opposing,
      Still higher swellâ€™d thy dauntless heart,
    And, while Despair the scene was closing,
      Commenced thy brief but brilliant part.

    â€˜T was then thou soughtâ€™st on Albynâ€™s hill,
      (When Englandâ€™s sons the strife resignâ€™d)
    A rugged race resisting still,
      And unsubdued though unrefined.

    Thy deathâ€™s hour heard no kindred wail,
      No holy knell thy requiem rung;
    Thy mourners were the plaided Gael,
      Thy dirge the clamourous pibroch sung.

    Yet who, in Fortuneâ€™s summer-shine
      To waste lifeâ€™s longest term away,
    Would change that glorious dawn of thine,
      Though darkenâ€™d ere its noontide day!

    Be thine the tree whose dauntless boughs
      Brave summerâ€™s drought and winterâ€™s gloom.
    Rome bound with oak her patriotsâ€™ brows,
      As Albyn shadows Woganâ€™s tomb.

Whatever might be the real merit of Flora Mac-Ivorâ€™s poetry, the
enthusiasm which it intimated was well calculated to make a corresponding
impression upon her lover. The lines were read--read again, then
deposited in Waverleyâ€™s bosom, then again drawn out, and read line by
line, in a low and smothered voice, and with frequent pauses which
prolonged the mental treat, as an epicure protracts, by sipping slowly,
the enjoyment of a delicious beverage. The entrance of Mrs. Cruickshanks
with the sublunary articles of dinner and wine hardly interrupted this
pantomime of affectionate enthusiasm.

At length the tall ungainly figure and ungracious visage of Ebenezer
presented themselves. The upper part of his form, notwithstanding the
season required no such defence, was shrouded in a large great-coat,
belted over his under habiliments, and crested with a huge cowl of the
same stuff, which, when drawn over the head and hat, completely
overshadowed both, and, being buttoned beneath the chin, was called a
trot-cozy. His hand grasped a huge jockey-whip, garnished with
brassmounting. His thin legs tenanted a pair of gambadoes, fastened at
the sides with rusty clasps. Thus accoutred, he stalked into the midst of
the apartment, and announced his errand in brief phrase: â€˜Yer horses are
ready.â€™

â€˜You go with me yourself then, landlord?â€™

â€˜I do, as far as Perth; where ye may be supplied with a guide to Embroâ€™,
as your occasions shall require.â€™

Thus saying, he placed under Waverleyâ€™s eye the bill which he held in his
hand; and at the same time, self-invited, filled a glass of wine and
drank devoutly to a blessing on their journey. Waverley stared at the
manâ€™s impudence, but, as their connection was to be short and promised to
be convenient, he made no observation upon it; and, having paid his
reckoning, expressed his intention to depart immediately. He mounted
Dermid accordingly and sallied forth from the Golden Candlestick,
followed by the puritanical figure we have described, after he had, at
the expense of some time and difficulty, and by the assistance of a
â€˜louping-on-stane,â€™ or structure of masonry erected for the travellerâ€™s
convenience in front of the house, elevated his person to the back of a
long-backed, raw-boned, thin-gutted phantom of a broken-down blood-horse,
on which Waverleyâ€™s portmanteau was deposited. Our hero, though not in a
very gay humour, could hardly help laughing at the appearance of his new
squire, and at imagining the astonishment which his person and equipage
would have excited at Waverley-Honour.

Edwardâ€™s tendency to mirth did not escape mine host of the Candlestick,
who, conscious of the cause, infused a double portion of souring into the
pharisaical leaven of his countenance, and resolved internally that, in
one way or other, the young â€˜Englisherâ€™ should pay dearly for the
contempt with which he seemed to regard him. Callum also stood at the
gate and enjoyed, with undissembled glee, the ridiculous figure of Mr.
Cruickshanks. As Waverley passed him he pulled off his hat respectfully,
and, approaching his stirrup, bade him â€˜Tak heed the auld whig deevil
played him nae cantrip.â€™

Waverley once more thanked and bade him farewell, and then rode briskly
onward, not sorry to be out of hearing of the shouts of the children, as
they beheld old Ebenezer rise and sink in his stirrups to avoid the
concussions occasioned by a hard trot upon a half-paved street. The
village of--was soon several miles behind him.



VOLUME II.

CHAPTER I

SHOWS THAT THE LOSS OF A HORSEâ€™S SHOE MAY BE A SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE

The manner and air of Waverley, but, above all, the glittering contents
of his purse, and the indifference with which he seemed to regard them,
somewhat overawed his companion, and deterred him from making any
attempts to enter upon conversation. His own reflections were moreover
agitated by various surmises, and by plans of self-interest with which
these were intimately connected. The travellers journeyed, therefore, in
silence, until it was interrupted by the annunciation, on the part of the
guide, that his â€˜naig had lost a fore-foot shoe, which, doubtless, his
honour would consider it was his part to replace.â€™

This was what lawyers call a fishing question, calculated to ascertain
how far Waverley was disposed to submit to petty imposition. â€˜My part to
replace your horseâ€™s shoe, you rascal!â€™ said Waverley, mistaking the
purport of the intimation.

â€˜Indubitably,â€™ answered Mr. Cruickshanks; â€˜though there was no preceese
clause to that effect, it canna be expected that I am to pay for the
casualties whilk may befall the puir naig while in your honourâ€™s service.
Nathless, if your honour--â€™

â€˜O, you mean I am to pay the farrier; but where shall we find one?â€™

Rejoiced at discerning there would be no objection made on the part of
his temporary master, Mr. Cruickshanks assured him that Cairnvreckan, a
village which they were about to enter, was happy in an excellent
blacksmith; â€˜but as he was a professor, he would drive a nail for no man
on the Sabbath or kirk-fast, unless it were in a case of absolute
necessity, for which he always charged sixpence each shoe.â€™ The most
important part of this communication, in the opinion of the speaker, made
a very slight impression on the hearer, who only internally wondered what
college this veterinary professor belonged to, not aware that the word
was used to denote any person who pretended to uncommon sanctity of faith
and manner.

As they entered the village of Cairnvreckan, they speedily distinguished
the smithâ€™s house. Being also a public, it was two stories high, and
proudly reared its crest, covered with grey slate, above the thatched
hovels by which it was surrounded. The adjoining smithy betokened none of
the Sabbatical silence and repose which Ebenezer had augured from the
sanctity of his friend. On the contrary, hammer clashed and anvil rang,
the bellows groaned, and the whole apparatus of Vulcan appeared to be in
full activity. Nor was the labour of a rural and pacific nature. The
master smith, benempt, as his sign intimated, John Mucklewrath, with two
assistants, toiled busily in arranging, repairing, and furbishing old
muskets, pistols, and swords, which lay scattered around his workshop in
military confusion. The open shed, containing the forge, was crowded with
persons who came and went as if receiving and communicating important
news, and a single glance at the aspect of the people who traversed the
street in haste, or stood assembled in groups, with eyes elevated and
hands uplifted, announced that some extraordinary intelligence was
agitating the public mind of the municipality of Cairnvreckan. â€˜There is
some news,â€™ said mine host of the Candlestick, pushing his lantern-jawed
visage and bare-boned nag rudely forward into the crowd--â€˜there is some
news; and, if it please my Creator, I will forthwith obtain speirings
thereof.â€™

Waverley, with better regulated curiosity than his attendantâ€™s,
dismounted and gave his horse to a boy who stood idling near. It arose,
perhaps, from the shyness of his character in early youth, that he felt
dislike at applying to a stranger even for casual information, without
previously glancing at his physiognomy and appearance. While he looked
about in order to select the person with whom he would most willingly
hold communication, the buzz around saved him in some degree the trouble
of interrogatories. The names of Lochiel, Clanronald, Glengarry, and
other distinguished Highland Chiefs, among whom Vich Ian Vohr was
repeatedly mentioned, were as familiar in menâ€™s mouths as household
words; and from the alarm generally expressed, he easily conceived that
their descent into the Lowlands, at the head of their armed tribes, had
either already taken place or was instantly apprehended.

Ere Waverley could ask particulars, a strong, large-boned, hard-featured
woman, about forty, dressed as if her clothes had been flung on with a
pitchfork, her cheeks flushed with a scarlet red where they were not
smutted with soot and lamp-black, jostled through the crowd, and,
brandishing high a child of two years old, which she danced in her arms
without regard to its screams of terror, sang forth with all her might,--

    Charlie is my darling, my darling, my darling,
    Charlie is my darling,
    The young Chevalier!

â€˜Dâ€™ ye hear whatâ€™s come ower ye now,â€™ continued the virago, â€˜ye whingeing
Whig carles? Dâ€™ye hear whaâ€™s coming to cow yer cracks?
    Little wot ye whaâ€™s coming,
    Little wot ye whaâ€™s coming,
    Aâ€™ the wild Macraws are coming.â€™
The Vulcan of Cairnvreckan, who acknowledged his Venus in this exulting
Bacchante, regarded her with a grim and ire-foreboding countenance, while
some of the senators of the village hastened to interpose. â€˜Whisht,
gudewife; is this a time or is this a day to be singing your ranting fule
sangs in?--a time when the wine of wrath is poured out without mixture in
the cup of indignation, and a day when the land should give testimony
against popery, and prelacy, and quakerism, and independency, and
supremacy, and erastianism, and antinomianism, and aâ€™ the errors of the
church?â€™

â€˜And thatâ€™s aâ€™ your Whiggery,â€™ reechoed the Jacobite heroine; â€˜thatâ€™s aâ€™
your Whiggery, and your presbytery, ye cut-lugged, graning carles! What!
dâ€™ ye think the lads wiâ€™ the kilts will care for yer synods and yer
presbyteries, and yer buttock-mail, and yer stool oâ€™ repentance?
Vengeance on the black face oâ€™t! mony an honester womanâ€™s been set upon
it than streeks doon beside ony Whig in the country. I mysell--â€™

Here John Mucklewrath, who dreaded her entering upon a detail of personal
experience, interposed his matrimonial authority. â€˜Gae hame, and be
d--(that I should say sae), and put on the sowens for supper.â€™

â€˜And you, ye doilâ€™d dotard,â€™ replied his gentle helpmate, her wrath,
which had hitherto wandered abroad over the whole assembly, being at once
and violently impelled into its natural channel, â€˜YE stand there
hammering dog-heads for fules that will never snap them at a Highlandman,
instead of earning bread for your family and shoeing this winsome young
gentlemanâ€™s horse thatâ€™s just come frae the north! Iâ€™se warrant him nane
of your whingeing King George folk, but a gallant Gordon, at the least oâ€™
him.â€™

The eyes of the assembly were now turned upon Waverley, who took the
opportunity to beg the smith to shoe his guideâ€™s horse with all speed, as
he wished to proceed on his journey; for he had heard enough to make him
sensible that there would be danger in delaying long in this place. The
smithâ€™s eyes rested on him with a look of displeasure and suspicion, not
lessened by the eagerness with which his wife enforced Waverleyâ€™s
mandate. â€˜Dâ€™ye hear what the weel-favoured young gentleman says, ye
drunken neâ€™er-do-good?â€™

â€˜And what may your name be, sir?â€™ quoth Mucklewrath.

â€˜It is of no consequence to you, my friend, provided I pay your labour.â€™

â€˜But it may be of consequence to the state, sir,â€™ replied an old farmer,
smelling strongly of whisky and peat-smoke; â€˜and I doubt we maun delay
your journey till you have seen the Laird.â€™

â€˜You certainly,â€™ said Waverley, haughtily, â€˜will find it both difficult
and dangerous to detain me, unless you can produce some proper
authority.â€™

There was a pause and a whisper among the crowd--â€˜Secretary
Murrayâ€™--â€˜Lord Lewis Gordonâ€™--â€˜Maybe the Chevalier himsell!â€™ Such were
the surmises that passed hurriedly among them, and there was obviously an
increased disposition to resist Waverleyâ€™s departure. He attempted to
argue mildly with them, but his voluntary ally, Mrs. Mucklewrath, broke
in upon and drowned his expostulations, taking his part with an abusive
violence which was all set down to Edwardâ€™s account by those on whom it
was bestowed. â€˜YEâ€™LL stop ony gentleman thatâ€™s the Princeâ€™s freend?â€™ for
she too, though with other feelings, had adopted the general opinion
respecting Waverley. â€˜I daur ye to touch him,â€™ spreading abroad her long
and muscular fingers, garnished with claws which a vulture might have
envied. â€˜Iâ€™ll set my ten commandments in the face oâ€™ the first loon that
lays a finger on him.â€™

â€˜Gae hame, gudewife,â€™ quoth the farmer aforesaid; â€˜it wad better set you
to be nursing the gudemanâ€™s bairns than to be deaving us here.â€™

â€˜HIS bairns?â€™ retorted the Amazon, regarding her husband with a grin of
ineffable contempt--â€˜HIS bairns!

    O gin ye were dead, gudeman,
      And a green turf on your head, gudeman!
    Then I wad ware my widowhood
      Upon a ranting Highlandmanâ€™

This canticle, which excited a suppressed titter among the younger part
of the audience, totally overcame the patience of the taunted man of the
anvil. â€˜Deil be in me but Iâ€™ll put this het gad down her throat!â€™ cried
he in an ecstasy of wrath, snatching a bar from the forge; and he might
have executed his threat, had he not been withheld by a part of the mob,
while the rest endeavoured to force the termagant out of his presence.

Waverley meditated a retreat in the confusion, but his horse was nowhere
to be seen. At length he observed at some distance his faithful
attendant, Ebenezer, who, as soon as he had perceived the turn matters
were likely to take, had withdrawn both horses from the press, and,
mounted on the one and holding the other, answered the loud and repeated
calls of Waverley for his horse. â€˜Na, na! if ye are nae friend to kirk
and the king, and are detained as siccan a person, ye maun answer to
honest men of the country for breach of contract; and I maun keep the
naig and the walise for damage and expense, in respect my horse and
mysell will lose to-morrowâ€™s dayâ€™s wark, besides the afternoon
preaching.â€™

Edward, out of patience, hemmed in and hustled by the rabble on every
side, and every moment expecting personal violence, resolved to try
measures of intimidation, and at length drew a pocket-pistol,
threatening, on the one hand, to shoot whomsoever dared to stop him, and,
on the other, menacing Ebenezer with a similar doom if he stirred a foot
with the horses. The sapient Partridge says that one man with a pistol is
equal to a hundred unarmed, because, though he can shoot but one of the
multitude, yet no one knows but that he himself may be that luckless
individual. The levy en masse of Cairnvreckan would therefore probably
have given way, nor would Ebenezer, whose natural paleness had waxed
three shades more cadaverous, have ventured to dispute a mandate so
enforced, had not the Vulcan of the village, eager to discharge upon some
more worthy object the fury which his helpmate had provoked, and not ill
satisfied to find such an object in Waverley, rushed at him with the
red-hot bar of iron with such determination as made the discharge of his
pistol an act of self-defence. The unfortunate man fell; and while
Edward, thrilled with a natural horror at the incident, neither had
presence of mind to unsheathe his sword nor to draw his remaining pistol,
the populace threw themselves upon him, disarmed him, and were about to
use him with great violence, when the appearance of a venerable
clergyman, the pastor of the parish, put a curb on their fury.

This worthy man (none of the Goukthrapples or Rentowels) maintained his
character with the common people, although he preached the practical
fruits of Christian faith as well as its abstract tenets, and was
respected by the higher orders, notwithstanding he declined soothing
their speculative errors by converting the pulpit of the gospel into a
school of heathen morality. Perhaps it is owing to this mixture of faith
and practice in his doctrine that, although his memory has formed a sort
of era in the annals of Cairnvreckan, so that the parishioners, to denote
what befell Sixty Years Since, still say it happened â€˜in good Mr.
Mortonâ€™s time,â€™ I have never been able to discover which he belonged to,
the evangelical or the moderate party in the kirk. Nor do I hold the
circumstance of much moment, since, in my own remembrance, the one was
headed by an Erskine, the other by a Robertson.

[Footnote: The Reverend John Erskine, D. D, an eminent Scottish divine
and a most excellent man, headed the Evangelical party in the Church of
Scotland at the time when the celebrated Doctor Robertson, the historian,
was the leader of the Moderate party. These two distinguished persons
were colleagues in the Old Grey Friarsâ€™ Church, Edinburgh; and, however
much they differed in church politics, preserved the most perfect harmony
as private friends and as clergymen serving the same cure]

Mr. Morton had been alarmed by the discharge of the pistol and the
increasing hubbub around the smithy. His first attention, after he had
directed the bystanders to detain Waverley, but to abstain from injuring
him, was turned to the body of Mucklewrath, over which his wife, in a
revulsion of feeling, was weeping, howling, and tearing her elf-locks in
a state little short of distraction. On raising up the smith, the first
discovery was that he was alive; and the next that he was likely to live
as long as if he had never heard the report of a pistol in his life. He
had made a narrow escape, however; the bullet had grazed his head and
stunned him for a moment or two, which trance terror and confusion of
spirit had prolonged somewhat longer. He now arose to demand vengeance on
the person of Waverley, and with difficulty acquiesced in the proposal of
Mr. Morton that he should be carried before the Laird, as a justice of
peace, and placed at his disposal. The rest of the assistants unanimously
agreed to the measure recommended; even Mrs. Mucklewrath, who had begun
to recover from her hysterics, whimpered forth, â€˜She wadna say naething
against what the minister proposed; he was eâ€™en ower gude for his trade,
and she hoped to see him wiâ€™ a dainty decent bishopâ€™s gown on his back; a
comelier sight than your Geneva cloaks and bands, I wis.â€™

All controversy being thus laid aside, Waverley, escorted by the whole
inhabitants of the village who were not bed-ridden, was conducted to the
house of Cairnvreckan, which was about half a mile distant.




CHAPTER II

AN EXAMINATION


Major Melville of Cairnvreckan, an elderly gentleman, who had spent his
youth in the military service, received Mr. Morton with great kindness,
and our hero with civility, which the equivocal circumstances wherein
Edward was placed rendered constrained and distant.

The nature of the smithâ€™s hurt was inquired into, and, as the actual
injury was likely to prove trifling, and the circumstances in which it
was received rendered the infliction on Edwardâ€™s part a natural act of
self-defence, the Major conceived he might dismiss that matter on
Waverleyâ€™s depositing in his hands a small sum for the benefit of the
wounded person.

â€˜I could wish, sir,â€™ continued the Major, â€˜that my duty terminated here;
but it is necessary that we should have some further inquiry into the
cause of your journey through the country at this unfortunate and
distracted time.â€™

Mr. Ebenezer Cruickshanks now stood forth, and communicated to the
magistrate all he knew or suspected from the reserve of Waverley and the
evasions of Callum Beg. The horse upon which Edward rode, he said, he
knew to belong to Vich Ian Vohr, though he dared not tax Edwardâ€™s former
attendant with the fact, lest he should have his house and stables burnt
over his head some night by that godless gang, the Mac-Ivors. He
concluded by exaggerating his own services to kirk and state, as having
been the means, under God (as he modestly qualified the assertion), of
attaching this suspicious and formidable delinquent. He intimated hopes
of future reward, and of instant reimbursement for loss of time, and even
of character, by travelling on the state business on the fast-day.

To this Major Melville answered, with great composure, that so far from
claiming any merit in this affair, Mr. Cruickshanks ought to deprecate
the imposition of a very heavy fine for neglecting to lodge, in terms of
the recent proclamation, an account with the nearest magistrate of any
stranger who came to his inn; that, as Mr. Cruickshanks boasted so much
of religion and loyalty, he should not impute this conduct to
disaffection, but only suppose that his zeal for kirk and state had been
lulled asleep by the opportunity of charging a stranger with double
horse-hire; that, however, feeling himself incompetent to decide singly
upon the conduct of a person of such importance, he should reserve it for
consideration of the next quarter-sessions. Now our history for the
present saith no more of him of the Candlestick, who wended dolorous and
malcontent back to his own dwelling.

Major Melville then commanded the villagers to return to their homes,
excepting two, who officiated as constables, and whom he directed to wait
below. The apartment was thus cleared of every person but Mr. Morton,
whom the Major invited to remain; a sort of factor, who acted as clerk;
and Waverley himself. There ensued a painful and embarrassed pause, till
Major Melville, looking upon Waverley with much compassion, and often
consulting a paper or memorandum which he held in his hand, requested to
know his name.

â€˜Edward Waverley.â€™

â€˜I thought so; late of the--dragoons, and nephew of Sir Everard Waverley
of Waverley-Honour?â€™

â€˜The same.â€™

â€˜Young gentleman, I am extremely sorry that this painful duty has fallen
to my lot.â€™

â€˜Duty, Major Melville, renders apologies superfluous.â€™

â€˜True, sir; permit me, therefore, to ask you how your time has been
disposed of since you obtained leave of absence from your regiment,
several weeks ago, until the present moment?â€™

â€˜My reply,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜to so general a question must be guided by
the nature of the charge which renders it necessary. I request to know
what that charge is, and upon what authority I am forcibly detained to
reply to it?â€™

â€˜The charge, Mr. Waverley, I grieve to say, is of a very high nature, and
affects your character both as a soldier and a subject. In the former
capacity you are charged with spreading mutiny and rebellion among the
men you commanded, and setting them the example of desertion, by
prolonging your own absence from the regiment, contrary to the express
orders of your commanding officer. The civil crime of which you stand
accused is that of high treason and levying war against the king, the
highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty.â€™

â€˜And by what authority am I detained to reply to such heinous calumnies?â€™

â€˜By one which you must not dispute, nor I disobey.â€™

He handed to Waverley a warrant from the Supreme Criminal Court of
Scotland, in full form, for apprehending and securing the person of
Edward Waverley, Esq., suspected of treasonable practices and other high
crimes and misdemeanours.

The astonishment which Waverley expressed at this communication was
imputed by Major Melville to conscious guilt, while Mr. Morton was rather
disposed to construe it into the surprise of innocence unjustly
suspected. There was something true in both conjectures; for although
Edwardâ€™s mind acquitted him of the crime with which he was charged, yet a
hasty review of his own conduct convinced him he might have great
difficulty in establishing his innocence to the satisfaction of others.

â€˜It is a very painful part of this painful business,â€™ said Major
Melville, after a pause, â€˜that, under so grave a charge, I must
necessarily request to see such papers as you have on your person.â€™

â€˜You shall, sir, without reserve,â€™ said Edward, throwing his pocket-book
and memorandums upon the table; â€˜there is but one with which I could wish
you would dispense.â€™

â€˜I am afraid, Mr. Waverley, I can indulge you with no reservation,â€™

â€˜You shall see it then, sir; and as it can be of no service, I beg it may
be returned.â€™

He took from his bosom the lines he had that morning received, and
presented them with the envelope. The Major perused them in silence, and
directed his clerk to make a copy of them. He then wrapped the copy in
the envelope, and placing it on the table before him, returned the
original to Waverley, with an air of melancholy gravity.

After indulging the prisoner, for such our hero must now be considered,
with what he thought a reasonable time for reflection, Major Melville
resumed his examination, premising that, as Mr. Waverley seemed to object
to general questions, his interrogatories should be as specific as his
information permitted. He then proceeded in his investigation, dictating,
as he went on, the import of the questions and answers to the amanuensis,
by whom it was written down.

â€˜Did Mr. Waverley know one Humphry Houghton, a non-commissioned officer
in Gardinerâ€™s dragoons?â€™

â€˜Certainly; he was sergeant of my troop, and son of a tenant of my
uncle.â€™

â€˜Exactly--and had a considerable share of your confidence, and an
influence among his comrades?â€™

â€˜I had never occasion to repose confidence in a person of his
description,â€™ answered Waverley. â€˜I favoured Sergeant Houghton as a
clever, active young fellow, and I believe his fellow-soldiers respected
him accordingly.â€™

â€˜But you used through this man,â€™ answered Major Melville, â€˜to communicate
with such of your troop as were recruited upon Waverley-Honour?â€™

â€˜Certainly; the poor fellows, finding themselves in a regiment chiefly
composed of Scotch or Irish, looked up to me in any of their little
distresses, and naturally made their countryman and sergeant their
spokesman on such occasions.â€™

â€˜Sergeant Houghtonâ€™s influence,â€™ continued the Major, â€˜extended, then,
particularly over those soldiers who followed you to the regiment from
your uncleâ€™s estate?â€™

â€˜Surely; but what is that to the present purpose?â€™

â€˜To that I am just coming, and I beseech your candid reply. Have you,
since leaving the regiment, held any correspondence, direct or indirect,
with this Sergeant Houghton?â€™

â€˜I!--I hold correspondence with a man of his rank and situation! How, or
for what purpose?â€™

â€˜That you are to explain. But did you not, for example, send to him for
some books?â€™

â€˜You remind me of a trifling commission,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜which I gave
Sergeant Houghton, because my servant could not read. I do recollect I
bade him, by letter, select some books, of which I sent him a list, and
send them to me at Tully-Veolan.â€™

â€˜And of what description were those books?â€™

â€˜They related almost entirely to elegant literature; they were designed
for a ladyâ€™s perusal.â€™

â€˜Were there not, Mr. Waverley, treasonable tracts and pamphlets among
them?â€™

â€˜There were some political treatises, into which I hardly looked. They
had been sent to me by the officiousness of a kind friend, whose heart is
more to be esteemed than his prudence or political sagacity; they seemed
to be dull compositions.â€™

â€˜That friend,â€™ continued the persevering inquirer, â€˜was a Mr. Pembroke, a
nonjuring clergyman, the author of two treasonable works, of which the
manuscripts were found among your baggage?â€™

â€˜But of which, I give you my honour as a gentleman,â€™ replied Waverley, â€˜I
never read six pages.â€™

â€˜I am not your judge, Mr. Waverley; your examination will be transmitted
elsewhere. And now to proceed. Do you know a person that passes by the
name of Wily Will, or Will Ruthven?â€™

â€˜I never heard of such a name till this moment.â€™

â€˜Did you never through such a person, or any other person, communicate
with Sergeant Humphry Houghton, instigating him to desert, with as many
of his comrades as he could seduce to join him, and unite with the
Highlanders and other rebels now in arms under the command of the Young
Pretender?â€™

â€˜I assure you I am not only entirely guiltless of the plot you have laid
to my charge, but I detest it from the very bottom of my soul, nor would
I be guilty of such treachery to gain a throne, either for myself or any
other man alive.â€™

â€˜Yet when I consider this envelope in the handwriting of one of those
misguided gentlemen who are now in arms against their country, and the
verses which it enclosed, I cannot but find some analogy between the
enterprise I have mentioned and the exploit of Wogan, which the writer
seems to expect you should imitate.â€™

Waverley was struck with the coincidence, but denied that the wishes or
expectations of the letter-writer were to be regarded as proofs of a
charge otherwise chimerical.

â€˜But, if I am rightly informed, your time was spent, during your absence
from the regiment, between the house of this Highland Chieftain and that
of Mr. Bradwardine of Bradwardine, also in arms for this unfortunate
cause?â€™

â€˜I do not mean to disguise it; but I do deny, most resolutely, being
privy to any of their designs against the government.â€™

â€˜You do not, however, I presume, intend to deny that you attended your
host Glennaquoich to a rendezvous, where, under a pretence of a general
hunting match, most of the accomplices of his treason were assembled to
concert measures for taking arms?â€™

â€˜I acknowledge having been at such a meeting,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜but I
neither heard nor saw anything which could give it the character you
affix to it.â€™

â€˜From thence you proceeded,â€™ continued the magistrate, â€˜with Glennaquoich
and a part of his clan to join the army of the Young Pretender, and
returned, after having paid your homage to him, to discipline and arm the
remainder, and unite them to his bands on their way southward?â€™

â€˜I never went with Glennaquoich on such an errand. I never so much as
heard that the person whom you mention was in the country.â€™

He then detailed the history of his misfortune at the hunting match, and
added, that on his return he found himself suddenly deprived of his
commission, and did not deny that he then, for the first time, observed
symptoms which indicated a disposition in the Highlanders to take arms;
but added that, having no inclination to join their cause, and no longer
any reason for remaining in Scotland, he was now on his return to his
native country, to which he had been summoned by those who had a right to
direct his motions, as Major Melville would perceive from the letters on
the table.

Major Melville accordingly perused the letters of Richard Waverley, of
Sir Everard, and of Aunt Rachel; but the inferences he drew from them
were different from what Waverley expected. They held the language of
discontent with government, threw out no obscure hints of revenge, and
that of poor Aunt Rachel, which plainly asserted the justice of the
Stuart cause, was held to contain the open avowal of what the others only
ventured to insinuate.

â€˜Permit me another question, Mr. Waverley,â€™ said Major Melville. â€˜Did you
not receive repeated letters from your commanding officer, warning you
and commanding you to return to your post, and acquainting you with the
use made of your name to spread discontent among your soldiers?â€™

â€˜I never did, Major Melville. One letter, indeed, I received from him,
containing a civil intimation of his wish that I would employ my leave of
absence otherwise than in constant residence at Bradwardine, as to which,
I own, I thought he was not called on to interfere; and, finally, I
received, on the same day on which I observed myself superseded in the
â€œGazette,â€ a second letter from Colonel Gardiner, commanding me to join
the regiment, an order which, owing to my absence, already mentioned and
accounted for, I received too late to be obeyed. If there were any
intermediate letters, and certainly from the Colonelâ€™s high character I
think it probable that there were, they have never reached me.â€™

â€˜I have omitted, Mr. Waverley,â€™ continued Major Melville, â€˜to inquire
after a matter of less consequence, but which has nevertheless been
publicly talked of to your disadvantage. It is said that a treasonable
toast having been proposed in your hearing and presence, you, holding his
Majestyâ€™s commission, suffered the task of resenting it to devolve upon
another gentleman of the company. This, sir, cannot be charged against
you in a court of justice; but if, as I am informed, the officers of your
regiment requested an explanation of such a rumour, as a gentleman and
soldier I cannot but be surprised that you did not afford it to them.â€™

This was too much. Beset and pressed on every hand by accusations, in
which gross falsehoods were blended with such circumstances of truth as
could not fail to procure them credit,--alone, unfriended, and in a
strange land, Waverley almost gave up his life and honour for lost, and,
leaning his head upon his hand, resolutely refused to answer any further
questions, since the fair and candid statement he had already made had
only served to furnish arms against him.

Without expressing either surprise or displeasure at the change in
Waverleyâ€™s manner, Major Melville proceeded composedly to put several
other queries to him.

â€˜What does it avail me to answer you?â€™ said Edward sullenly. â€˜You appear
convinced of my guilt, and wrest every reply I have made to support your
own preconceived opinion. Enjoy your supposed triumph, then, and torment
me no further. If I am capable of the cowardice and treachery your charge
burdens me with, I am not worthy to be believed in any reply I can make
to you. If I am not deserving of your suspicion--and God and my own
conscience bear evidence with me that it is so--then I do not see why I
should, by my candour, lend my accusers arms against my innocence. There
is no reason I should answer a word more, and I am determined to abide by
this resolution.â€™

And again he resumed his posture of sullen and determined silence.

â€˜Allow me,â€™ said the magistrate, â€˜to remind you of one reason that may
suggest the propriety of a candid and open confession. The inexperience
of youth, Mr. Waverley, lays it open to the plans of the more designing
and artful; and one of your friends at least--I mean Mac-Ivor of
Glennaquoich--ranks high in the latter class, as, from your apparent
ingenuousness, youth, and unacquaintance with the manners of the
Highlands, I should be disposed to place you among the former. In such a
case, a false step or error like yours, which I shall be happy to
consider as involuntary, may be atoned for, and I would willingly act as
intercessor. But, as you must necessarily be acquainted with the strength
of the individuals in this country who have assumed arms, with their
means and with their plans, I must expect you will merit this mediation
on my part by a frank and candid avowal of all that has come to your
knowledge upon these heads; in which case, I think I can venture to
promise that a very short personal restraint will be the only ill
consequence that can arise from your accession to these unhappy
intrigues.â€™

Waverley listened with great composure until the end of this exhortation,
when, springing from his seat with an energy he had not yet displayed, he
replied, â€˜Major Melville, since that is your name, I have hitherto
answered your questions with candour, or declined them with temper,
because their import concerned myself alone; but, as you presume to
esteem me mean enough to commence informer against others, who received
me, whatever may be their public misconduct, as a guest and friend, I
declare to you that I consider your questions as an insult infinitely
more offensive than your calumnious suspicions; and that, since my hard
fortune permits me no other mode of resenting them than by verbal
defiance, you should sooner have my heart out of my bosom than a single
syllable of information on subjects which I could only become acquainted
with in the full confidence of unsuspecting hospitality.â€™

Mr. Morton and the Major looked at each other; and the former, who, in
the course of the examination, had been repeatedly troubled with a sorry
rheum, had recourse to his snuff-box and his handkerchief.

â€˜Mr. Waverley,â€™ said the Major, â€˜my present situation prohibits me alike
from giving or receiving offence, and I will not protract a discussion
which approaches to either. I am afraid I must sign a warrant for
detaining you in custody, but this house shall for the present be your
prison. I fear I cannot persuade you to accept a share of our
supper?--(Edward shook his head)--but I will order refreshments in your
apartment.â€™

Our hero bowed and withdrew, under guard of the officers of justice, to a
small but handsome room, where, declining all offers of food or wine, he
flung himself on the bed, and, stupified by the harassing events and
mental fatigue of this miserable day, he sunk into a deep and heavy
slumber. This was more than he himself could have expected; but it is
mentioned of the North-American Indians, when at the stake of torture,
that on the least intermission of agony they will sleep until the fire is
applied to awaken them.




CHAPTER III

A CONFERENCE AND THE CONSEQUENCE


Major Melville had detained Mr. Morton during his examination of
Waverley, both because he thought he might derive assistance from his
practical good sense and approved loyalty, and also because it was
agreeable to have a witness of unimpeached candour and veracity to
proceedings which touched the honour and safety of a young Englishman of
high rank and family, and the expectant heir of a large fortune. Every
step he knew would be rigorously canvassed, and it was his business to
place the justice and integrity of his own conduct beyond the limits of
question.

When Waverley retired, the laird and clergyman of Cairnvreckan sat down
in silence to their evening meal. While the servants were in attendance
neither chose to say anything on the circumstances which occupied their
minds, and neither felt it easy to speak upon any other. The youth and
apparent frankness of Waverley stood in strong contrast to the shades of
suspicion which darkened around him, and he had a sort of naivete and
openness of demeanour that seemed to belong to one unhackneyed in the
ways of intrigue, and which pleaded highly in his favour.

Each mused over the particulars of the examination, and each viewed it
through the medium of his own feelings. Both were men of ready and acute
talent, and both were equally competent to combine various parts of
evidence, and to deduce from them the necessary conclusions. But the wide
difference of their habits and education often occasioned a great
discrepancy in their respective deductions from admitted premises.

Major Melville had been versed in camps and cities; he was  vigilant by
profession and cautious from experience, had met with much evil in the
world, and therefore, though himself an upright magistrate and an
honourable man, his opinions of others were always strict, and sometimes
unjustly severe. Mr. Morton, on the contrary, had passed from the
literary pursuits of a college, where he was beloved by his companions
and respected by his teachers, to the ease and simplicity of his present
charge, where his opportunities of witnessing evil were few, and never
dwelt upon but in order to encourage repentance and amendment; and where
the love and respect of his parishioners repaid his affectionate zeal in
their behalf by endeavouring to disguise from him what they knew would
give him the most acute pain, namely, their own occasional transgressions
of the duties which it was the business of his life to recommend. Thus it
was a common saying in the neighbourhood (though both were popular
characters), that the laird knew only the ill in the parish and the
minister only the good.

A love of letters, though kept in subordination to his clerical studies
and duties, also distinguished the pastor of Cairnvreckan, and had tinged
his mind in earlier days with a slight feeling of romance, which no after
incidents of real life had entirely dissipated. The early loss of an
amiable young woman whom he had married for love, and who was quickly
followed to the grave by an only child, had also served, even after the
lapse of many years, to soften a disposition naturally mild and
contemplative. His feelings on the present occasion were therefore likely
to differ from those of the severe disciplinarian, strict magistrate, and
distrustful man of the world.

When the servants had withdrawn, the silence of both parties continued,
until Major Melville, filling his glass and pushing the bottle to Mr.
Morton, commenced--

â€˜A distressing affair this, Mr. Morton. I fear this youngster has brought
himself within the compass of a halter.â€™

â€˜God forbid!â€™ answered the clergyman.

â€˜Marry, and amen,â€™ said the temporal magistrate; â€˜but I think even your
merciful logic will hardly deny the conclusion.â€™

â€˜Surely, Major,â€™ answered the clergyman, â€˜I should hope it might be
averted, for aught we have heard tonight?â€™

â€˜Indeed!â€™ replied Melville. â€˜But, my good parson, you are one of those
who would communicate to every criminal the benefit of clergy.â€™

â€˜Unquestionably I would. Mercy and long-suffering are the grounds of the
doctrine I am called to teach.â€™

â€˜True, religiously speaking; but mercy to a criminal may be gross
injustice to the community. I donâ€™t speak of this young fellow in
particular, who I heartily wish may be able to clear himself, for I like
both his modesty and his spirit. But I fear he has rushed upon his fate.â€™

â€˜And why? Hundreds of misguided gentlemen are now in arms against the
government, many, doubtless, upon principles which education and early
prejudice have gilded with the names of patriotism and heroism; Justice,
when she selects her victims from such a multitude (for surely all will
not be destroyed), must regard the moral motive. He whom ambition or hope
of personal advantage has led to disturb the peace of a well-ordered
government, let him fall a victim to the laws; but surely youth, misled
by the wild visions of chivalry and imaginary loyalty, may plead for
pardon.â€™

â€˜If visionary chivalry and imaginary loyalty come within the predicament
of high treason,â€™ replied the magistrate, â€˜I know no court in
Christendom, my dear Mr. Morton, where they can sue out their Habeas
Corpus.â€™

â€˜But I cannot see that this youthâ€™s guilt is at all established to my
satisfaction,â€™ said the clergyman.

â€˜Because your good-nature blinds your good sense,â€™ replied Major
Melville. â€˜Observe now: This young man, descended of a family of
hereditary Jacobites, his uncle the leader of the Tory interest in the
county of ----, his father a disobliged and discontented courtier, his
tutor a nonjuror and the author of two treasonable volumes--this youth, I
say, enters into Gardinerâ€™s dragoons, bringing with him a body of young
fellows from his uncleâ€™s estate, who have not stickled at avowing in
their way the High-Church principles they learned at Waverley-Honour, in
their disputes with their comrades. To these young men Waverley is
unusually attentive; they are supplied with money beyond a soldierâ€™s
wants and inconsistent with his discipline; and are under the management
of a favourite sergeant, through whom they hold an unusually close
communication with their captain, and affect to consider themselves as
independent of the other officers, and superior to their comrades.â€™

â€˜All this, my dear Major, is the natural consequence of their attachment
to their young landlord, and of their finding themselves in a regiment
levied chiefly in the north of Ireland and the west of Scotland, and of
course among comrades disposed to quarrel with them, both as Englishmen
and as members of the Church of England.â€™

â€˜Well said, parson!â€™ replied the magistrate. â€˜I would some of your synod
heard you. But let me go on. This young man obtains leave of absence,
goes to Tully-Veolan--the principles of the Baron of Bradwardine are
pretty well known, not to mention that this ladâ€™s uncle brought him off
in the year fifteen; he engages there in a brawl, in which he is said to
have disgraced the commission he bore; Colonel Gardiner writes to him,
first mildly, then more sharply--I think you will not doubt his having
done so, since he says so; the mess invite him to explain the quarrel in
which he is said to have been involved; he neither replies to his
commander nor his comrades. In the meanwhile his soldiers become mutinous
and disorderly, and at length, when the rumour of this unhappy rebellion
becomes general, his favourite Sergeant Houghton and another fellow are
detected in correspondence with a French emissary, accredited, as he
says, by Captain Waverley, who urges him, according to the menâ€™s
confession, to desert with the troop and join their captain, who was with
Prince Charles. In the meanwhile this trusty captain is, by his own
admission, residing at Glennaquoich with the most active, subtle, and
desperate Jacobite in Scotland; he goes with him at least as far as their
famous hunting rendezvous, and I fear a little farther. Meanwhile two
other summonses are sent him; one warning him of the disturbances in his
troop, another peremptorily ordering him to repair to the regiment,
which, indeed, common sense might have dictated, when he observed
rebellion thickening all round him. He returns an absolute refusal, and
throws up his commission.â€™

â€˜He had been already deprived of it,â€™ said Mr. Morton.

â€˜But he regrets,â€™ replied Melville, â€˜that the measure had anticipated his
resignation. His baggage is seized at his quarters and at Tully-Veolan,
and is found to contain a stock of pestilent Jacobitical pamphlets,
enough to poison a whole country, besides the unprinted lucubrations of
his worthy friend and tutor Mr. Pembroke.â€™

â€˜He says he never read them,â€™ answered the minister.

â€˜In an ordinary case I should believe him,â€™ replied the magistrate, â€˜for
they are as stupid and pedantic in composition as mischievous in their
tenets. But can you suppose anything but value for the principles they
maintain would induce a young man of his age to lug such trash about with
him? Then, when news arrive of the approach of the rebels, he sets out in
a sort of disguise, refusing to tell his name; and, if yon old fanatic
tell truth, attended by a very suspicious character, and mounted on a
horse known to have belonged to Glennaquoich, and bearing on his person
letters from his family expressing high rancour against the house of
Brunswick, and a copy of verses in praise of one Wogan, who abjured the
service of the Parliament to join the Highland insurgents, when in arms
to restore the house of Stuart, with a body of English cavalry--the very
counterpart of his own plot--and summed up with a â€œGo thou and do
likewiseâ€ from that loyal subject, and most safe and peaceable character,
Fergus Mac-Ivor of Glennaquoich, Vich Ian Vohr, and so forth. And,
lastly,â€™ continued Major Melville, warming in the detail of his
arguments, â€˜where do we find this second edition of Cavalier Wogan? Why,
truly, in the very track most proper for execution of his design, and
pistolling the first of the kingâ€™s subjects who ventures to question his
intentions.â€™

Mr. Morton prudently abstained from argument, which he perceived would
only harden the magistrate in his opinion, and merely asked how he
intended to dispose of the prisoner?

â€˜It is a question of some difficulty, considering the state of the
country,â€™ said Major Melville.

â€˜Could you not detain him (being such a gentleman-like young man) here in
your own house, out of harmâ€™s way, till this storm blow over?â€™

â€˜My good friend,â€™ said Major Melville, â€˜neither your house nor mine will
be long out of harmâ€™s way, even were it legal to confine him here. I have
just learned that the commander-in-chief, who marched into the Highlands
to seek out and disperse the insurgents, has declined giving them battle
at Coryarrick, and marched on northward with all the disposable force of
government to Inverness, John-oâ€™-Groatâ€™s House, or the devil, for what I
know, leaving the road to the Low Country open and undefended to the
Highland army.â€™

â€˜Good God!â€™ said the clergyman. â€˜Is the man a coward, a traitor, or an
idiot?â€™

â€˜None of the three, I believe,â€™ answered Melville. â€˜Sir John has the
commonplace courage of a common soldier, is honest enough, does what he
is commanded, and understands what is told him, but is as fit to act for
himself in circumstances of importance as I, my dear parson, to occupy
your pulpit.â€™

This important public intelligence naturally diverted the discourse from
Waverley for some time; at length, however, the subject was resumed.

â€˜I believe,â€™ said Major Melville, â€˜that I must give this young man in
charge to some of the detached parties of armed volunteers who were
lately sent out to overawe the disaffected districts. They are now
recalled towards Stirling, and a small body comes this way to-morrow or
next day, commanded by the westland man--whatâ€™s his name? You saw him,
and said he was the very model of one of Cromwellâ€™s military saints.â€™

â€˜Gilfillan, the Cameronian,â€™ answered Mr. Morton. â€˜I wish the young
gentleman may be safe with him. Strange things are done in the heat and
hurry of minds in so agitating a crisis, and I fear Gilfillan is of a
sect which has suffered persecution without learning mercy.â€™

â€˜He has only to lodge Mr. Waverley in Stirling Castle,â€™ said the Major;
â€˜I will give strict injunctions to treat him well. I really cannot devise
any better mode for securing him, and I fancy you would hardly advise me
to encounter the responsibility of setting him at liberty.â€™

â€˜But you will have no objection to my seeing him tomorrow in private?â€™
said the minister.

â€˜None, certainly; your loyalty and character are my warrant. But with
what view do you make the request?â€™

â€˜Simply,â€™ replied Mr. Morton, â€˜to make the experiment whether he may not
be brought to communicate to me some circumstances which may hereafter be
useful to alleviate, if not to exculpate, his conduct.â€™

The friends now parted and retired to rest, each filled with the most
anxious reflections on the state of the country.




CHAPTER IV

A CONFIDANT


Waverley awoke in the morning from troubled dreams and unrefreshing
slumbers to a full consciousness of the horrors of his situation. How it
might terminate he knew not. He might be delivered up to military law,
which, in the midst of civil war, was not likely to be scrupulous in the
choice of its victims or the quality of the evidence. Nor did he feel
much more comfortable at the thoughts of a trial before a Scottish court
of justice, where he knew the laws and forms differed in many respects
from those of England, and had been taught to believe, however
erroneously, that the liberty and rights of the subject were less
carefully protected. A sentiment of bitterness rose in his mind against
the government, which he considered as the cause of his embarrassment and
peril, and he cursed internally his scrupulous rejection of Mac-Ivorâ€™s
invitation to accompany him to the field.

â€˜Why did not I,â€™ he said to himself, â€˜like other men of honour, take the
earliest opportunity to welcome to Britain the descendant of her ancient
kings and lineal heir of her throne? Why did not I--

    Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
    And welcome home again discarded faith,
    Seek out Prince Charles, and fall before his feet?

All that has been recorded of excellence and worth in the house of
Waverley has been founded upon their loyal faith to the house of Stuart.
From the interpretation which this Scotch magistrate has put upon the
letters of my uncle and father, it is plain that I ought to have
understood them as marshalling me to the course of my ancestors; and it
has been my gross dulness, joined to the obscurity of expression which
they adopted for the sake of security, that has confounded my judgment.
Had I yielded to the first generous impulse of indignation when I learned
that my honour was practised upon, how different had been my present
situation! I had then been free and in arms fighting, like my
forefathers, for love, for loyalty, and for fame. And now I am here,
netted and in the toils, at the disposal of a suspicious, stern, and
cold-hearted man, perhaps to be turned over to the solitude of a dungeon
or the infamy of a public execution. O, Fergus! how true has your
prophecy proved; and how speedy, how very speedy, has been its
accomplishment!â€™

While Edward was ruminating on these painful subjects of contemplation,
and very naturally, though not quite so justly, bestowing upon the
reigning dynasty that blame which was due to chance, or, in part at
least, to his own unreflecting conduct, Mr. Morton availed himself of
Major Melvilleâ€™s permission to pay him an early visit.

Waverleyâ€™s first impulse was to intimate a desire that he might not be
disturbed with questions or conversation; but he suppressed it upon
observing the benevolent and reverend appearance of the clergyman who had
rescued him from the immediate violence of the villagers.

â€˜I believe, sir,â€™ said the unfortunate young man, â€˜that in any other
circumstances I should have had as much gratitude to express to you as
the safety of my life may be worth; but such is the present tumult of my
mind, and such is my anticipation of what I am yet likely to endure, that
I can hardly offer you thanks for your interposition.â€™

Mr. Morton replied, that, far from making any claim upon his good
opinion, his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out
the means of deserving it. â€˜My excellent friend, Major Melville,â€™ he
continued, â€˜has feelings and duties as a soldier and public functionary
by which I am not fettered; nor can I always coincide in opinions which
he forms, perhaps with too little allowance for the imperfections of
human nature.â€™ He paused and then proceeded: â€˜I do not intrude myself on
your confidence, Mr. Waverley, for the purpose of learning any
circumstances the knowledge of which can be prejudicial either to
yourself or to others; but I own my earnest wish is that you would
intrust me with any particulars which could lead to your exculpation. I
can solemnly assure you they will be deposited with a faithful and, to
the extent of his limited powers, a zealous agent.â€™

â€˜You are, sir, I presume, a Presbyterian clergyman?â€™ Mr. Morton bowed.
â€˜Were I to be guided by the prepossessions of education, I might distrust
your friendly professions in my case; but I have observed that similar
prejudices are nourished in this country against your professional
brethren of the Episcopal persuasion, and I am willing to believe them
equally unfounded in both cases.â€™

â€˜Evil to him that thinks otherwise,â€™ said Mr. Morton; â€˜or who holds
church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of Christian faith
or moral virtue.â€™

â€˜But,â€™ continued Waverley, â€˜I cannot perceive why I should trouble you
with a detail of particulars, out of which, after revolving them as
carefully as possible in my recollection, I find myself unable to explain
much of what is charged against me. I know, indeed, that I am innocent,
but I hardly see how I can hope to prove myself so.â€™

â€˜It is for that very reason, Mr. Waverley,â€™ said the clergyman, â€˜that I
venture to solicit your confidence. My knowledge of individuals in this
country is pretty general, and can upon occasion be extended. Your
situation will, I fear, preclude your taking those active steps for
recovering intelligence or tracing imposture which I would willingly
undertake in your behalf; and if you are not benefited by my exertions,
at least they cannot be prejudicial to you.â€™

Waverley, after a few minutesâ€™ reflection, was convinced that his
reposing confidence in Mr. Morton, so far as he himself was concerned,
could hurt neither Mr. Bradwardine nor Fergus Mac-Ivor, both of whom had
openly assumed arms against the government, and that it might possibly,
if the professions of his new friend corresponded in sincerity with the
earnestness of his expression, be of some service to himself. He
therefore ran briefly over most of the events with which the reader is
already acquainted, suppressing his attachment to Flora, and indeed
neither mentioning her nor Rose Bradwardine in the course of his
narrative.

Mr. Morton seemed particularly struck with the account of Waverleyâ€™s
visit to Donald Bean Lean. â€˜I am glad,â€™ he said, â€˜you did not mention
this circumstance to the Major. It is capable of great misconstruction on
the part of those who do not consider the power of curiosity and the
influence of romance as motives of youthful conduct. When I was a young
man like you, Mr. Waverley, any such hair-brained expedition (I beg your
pardon for the expression) would have had inexpressible charms for me.
But there are men in the world who will not believe that danger and
fatigue are often incurred without any very adequate cause, and therefore
who are sometimes led to assign motives of action entirely foreign to the
truth. This man Bean Lean is renowned through the country as a sort of
Robin Hood, and the stories which are told of his address and enterprise
are the common tales of the winter fireside. He certainly possesses
talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves; and, being neither
destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples, he will probably
attempt, by every means, to distinguish himself during the period of
these unhappy commotions.â€™ Mr. Morton then made a careful memorandum of
the various particulars of Waverleyâ€™s interview with Donald Bean Lean and
the other circumstances which he had communicated.

The interest which this good man seemed to take in his misfortunes, above
all, the full confidence he appeared to repose in his innocence, had the
natural effect of softening Edwardâ€™s heart, whom the coldness of Major
Melville had taught to believe that the world was leagued to oppress him.
He shook Mr. Morton warmly by the hand, and, assuring him that his
kindness and sympathy had relieved his mind of a heavy load, told him
that, whatever might be his own fate, he belonged to a family who had
both gratitude and the power of displaying it. The earnestness of his
thanks called drops to the eyes of the worthy clergyman, who was doubly
interested in the cause for which he had volunteered his services, by
observing the genuine and undissembled feelings of his young friend.

Edward now inquired if Mr. Morton knew what was likely to be his
destination.

â€˜Stirling Castle,â€™ replied his friend; â€˜and so far I am well pleased for
your sake, for the governor is a man of honour and humanity. But I am
more doubtful of your treatment upon the road; Major Melville is
involuntarily obliged to intrust the custody of your person to another.â€™

â€˜I am glad of it,â€™ answered Waverley. â€˜I detest that cold-blooded
calculating Scotch magistrate. I hope he and I shall never meet more. He
had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness; and the
petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility,
while he tortured me by his questions, his suspicions, and his
inferences, was as tormenting as the racks of the Inquisition. Do not
vindicate him, my dear sir, for that I cannot bear with patience; tell me
rather who is to have the charge of so important a state prisoner as I
am.â€™

â€˜I believe a person called Gilfillan, one of the sect who are termed
Cameronians.â€™

â€˜I never heard of them before.â€™

â€˜They claim,â€™ said the clergyman, â€˜to represent the more strict and
severe Presbyterians, who, in Charles Secondâ€™s and James Secondâ€™s days,
refused to profit by the Toleration, or Indulgence, as it was called,
which was extended to others of that religion. They held conventicles in
the open fields, and, being treated with great violence and cruelty by
the Scottish government, more than once took arms during those reigns.
They take their name from their leader, Richard Cameron.â€™

â€˜I recollect,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜but did not the triumph of Presbytery at
the Revolution extinguish that sect?â€™

â€˜By no means,â€™ replied Morton; â€˜that great event fell yet far short of
what they proposed, which was nothing less than the complete
establishment of the Presbyterian Church upon the grounds of the old
Solemn League and Covenant. Indeed, I believe they scarce knew what they
wanted; but being a numerous body of men, and not unacquainted with the
use of arms, they kept themselves together as a separate party in the
state, and at the time of the Union had nearly formed a most unnatural
league with their old enemies the Jacobites to oppose that important
national measure. Since that time their numbers have gradually
diminished; but a good many are still to be found in the western
counties, and several, with a better temper than in 1707, have now taken
arms for government. This person, whom they call Gifted Gilfillan, has
been long a leader among them, and now heads a small party, which will
pass here to-day or to-morrow on their march towards Stirling, under
whose escort Major Melville proposes you shall travel. I would willingly
speak to Gilfillan in your behalf; but, having deeply imbibed all the
prejudices of his sect, and being of the same fierce disposition, he
would pay little regard to the remonstrances of an Erastian divine, as he
would politely term me. And now, farewell, my young friend; for the
present I must not weary out the Majorâ€™s indulgence, that I may obtain
his permission to visit you again in the course of the day.â€™




CHAPTER V

THINGS MEND A LITTLE


About noon Mr. Morton returned and brought an invitation from Major
Melville that Mr. Waverley would honour him with his company to dinner,
notwithstanding the unpleasant affair which detained him at Cairnvreckan,
from which he should heartily rejoice to see Mr. Waverley completely
extricated. The truth was that Mr. Mortonâ€™s favourable report and opinion
had somewhat staggered the preconceptions of the old soldier concerning
Edwardâ€™s supposed accession to the mutiny in the regiment; and in the
unfortunate state of the country the mere suspicion of disaffection or an
inclination to join the insurgent Jacobites might infer criminality
indeed, but certainly not dishonour. Besides, a person whom the Major
trusted had reported to him (though, as it proved, inaccurately) a
contradiction of the agitating news of the preceding evening. According
to this second edition of the intelligence, the Highlanders had withdrawn
from the Lowland frontier with the purpose of following the army in their
march to Inverness. The Major was at a loss, indeed, to reconcile his
information with the well-known abilities of some of the gentlemen in the
Highland army, yet it was the course which was likely to be most
agreeable to others. He remembered the same policy had detained them in
the north in the year 1715, and he anticipated a similar termination to
the insurrection as upon that occasion.

This news put him in such good-humour that he readily acquiesced in Mr.
Mortonâ€™s proposal to pay some hospitable attention to his unfortunate
guest, and voluntarily added, he hoped the whole affair would prove a
youthful escapade, which might be easily atoned by a short confinement.
The kind mediator had some trouble to prevail on his young friend to
accept the invitation. He dared not urge to him the real motive, which
was a good-natured wish to secure a favourable report of Waverleyâ€™s case
from Major Melville to Governor Blakeney. He remarked, from the flashes
of our heroâ€™s spirit, that touching upon this topic would be sure to
defeat his purpose. He therefore pleaded that the invitation argued the
Majorâ€™s disbelief of any part of the accusation which was inconsistent
with Waverleyâ€™s conduct as a soldier and a man of honour, and that to
decline his courtesy might be interpreted into a consciousness that it
was unmerited. In short, he so far satisfied Edward that the manly and
proper course was to meet the Major on easy terms that, suppressing his
strong dislike again to encounter his cold and punctilious civility,
Waverley agreed to be guided by his new friend.

The meeting at first was stiff and formal enough. But Edward, having
accepted the invitation, and his mind being really soothed and relieved
by the kindness of Morton, held himself bound to behave with ease, though
he could not affect cordiality. The Major was somewhat of a bon vivant,
and his wine was excellent. He told his old campaign stories, and
displayed much knowledge of men and manners. Mr. Morton had an internal
fund of placid and quiet gaiety, which seldom failed to enliven any small
party in which he found himself pleasantly seated. Waverley, whose life
was a dream, gave ready way to the predominating impulse and became the
most lively of the party. He had at all times remarkable natural powers
of conversation, though easily silenced by discouragement. On the present
occasion he piqued himself upon leaving on the minds of his companions a
favourable impression of one who, under such disastrous circumstances,
could sustain his misfortunes with ease and gaiety. His spirits, though
not unyielding, were abundantly elastic, and soon seconded his efforts.
The trio were engaged in very lively discourse, apparently delighted with
each other, and the kind host was pressing a third bottle of Burgundy,
when the sound of a drum was heard at some distance. The Major, who, in
the glee of an old soldier, had forgot the duties of a magistrate,
cursed, with a muttered military oath, the circumstances which recalled
him to his official functions. He rose and went towards the window, which
commanded a very near view of the highroad, and he was followed by his
guests.

The drum advanced, beating no measured martial tune, but a kind of
rub-a-dub-dub, like that with which the fire-drum startles the slumbering
artizans of a Scotch burgh. It is the object of this history to do
justice to all men; I must therefore record, in justice to the drummer,
that he protested he could beat any known march or point of war known in
the British army, and had accordingly commenced with â€˜Dumbartonâ€™s Drums,â€™
when he was silenced by Gifted Gilfillan, the commander of the party, who
refused to permit his followers to move to this profane, and even, as he
said, persecutive tune, and commanded the drummer to beat the 119th
Psalm. As this was beyond the capacity of the drubber of sheepskin, he
was fain to have recourse to the inoffensive row-de-dow as a harmless
substitute for the sacred music which his instrument or skill were unable
to achieve. This may be held a trifling anecdote, but the drummer in
question was no less than town-drummer of Anderton. I remember his
successor in office, a member of that enlightened body, the British
Convention. Be his memory, therefore, treated with due respect.




CHAPTER VI

A VOLUNTEER SIXTY YEARS SINCE


On hearing the unwelcome sound of the drum, Major Melville hastily opened
a sashed door and stepped out upon a sort of terrace which divided his
house from the highroad from which the martial music proceeded. Waverley
and his new friend followed him, though probably he would have dispensed
with their attendance. They soon recognised in solemn march, first, the
performer upon the drum; secondly, a large flag of four compartments, on
which were inscribed the words, COVENANT, KIRK, KING, KINGDOMS. The
person who was honoured with this charge was followed by the commander of
the party, a thin, dark, rigid-looking man, about sixty years old. The
spiritual pride, which in mine host of the Candlestick mantled in a sort
of supercilious hypocrisy, was in this manâ€™s face elevated and yet
darkened by genuine and undoubting fanaticism. It was impossible to
behold him without imagination placing him in some strange crisis, where
religious zeal was the ruling principle. A martyr at the stake, a soldier
in the field, a lonely and banished wanderer consoled by the intensity
and supposed purity of his faith under every earthly privation, perhaps a
persecuting inquisitor, as terrific in power as unyielding in adversity;
any of these seemed congenial characters to this personage. With these
high traits of energy, there was something in the affected precision and
solemnity of his deportment and discourse that bordered upon the
ludicrous; so that, according to the mood of the spectatorâ€™s mind and the
light under which Mr. Gilfillan presented himself, one might have feared,
admired, or laughed at him. His dress was that of a West-Country peasant,
of better materials indeed than that of the lower rank, but in no respect
affecting either the mode of the age or of the Scottish gentry at any
period. His arms were a broadsword and pistols, which, from the antiquity
of their appearance, might have seen the rout of Pentland or Bothwell
Brigg.

As he came up a few steps to meet Major Melville, and touched solemnly,
but slightly, his huge and over-brimmed blue bonnet, in answer to the
Major, who had courteously raised a small triangular gold-laced hat,
Waverley was irresistibly impressed with the idea that he beheld a leader
of the Roundheads of yore in conference with one of Marlboroughâ€™s
captains.

The group of about thirty armed men who followed this gifted commander
was of a motley description. They were in ordinary Lowland dresses, of
different colours, which, contrasted with the arms they bore, gave them
an irregular and mobbish appearance; so much is the eye accustomed to
connect uniformity of dress with the military character. In front were a
few who apparently partook of their leaderâ€™s enthusiasm, men obviously to
be feared in a combat, where their natural courage was exalted by
religious zeal. Others puffed and strutted, filled with the importance of
carrying arms and all the novelty of their situation, while the rest,
apparently fatigued with their march, dragged their limbs listlessly
along, or straggled from their companions to procure such refreshments as
the neighbouring cottages and alehouses afforded. Six grenadiers of
Ligonierâ€™s, thought the Major to himself, as his mind reverted to his own
military experience, would have sent all these fellows to the right
about.

Greeting, however, Mr. Gilfillan civilly, he requested to know if he had
received the letter he had sent to him upon his march, and could
undertake the charge of the state prisoner whom he there mentioned as far
as Stirling Castle. â€˜Yea,â€™ was the concise reply of the Cameronian
leader, in a voice which seemed to issue from the very penetralia of his
person.

â€˜But your escort, Mr. Gilfillan, is not so strong as I expected,â€™ said
Major Melville.

â€˜Some of the people,â€™ replied Gilfillan, â€˜hungered and were athirst by
the way, and tarried until their poor souls were refreshed with the
word.â€™

â€˜I am sorry, sir,â€™ replied the Major, â€˜you did not trust to your
refreshing your men at Cairnvreckan; whatever my house contains is at the
command of persons employed in the service.â€™

â€˜It was not of creature-comforts I spake,â€™ answered the Covenanter,
regarding Major Melville with something like a smile of contempt;
â€˜howbeit, I thank you; but the people remained waiting upon the precious
Mr. Jabesh Rentowel for the out-pouring of the afternoon exhortation.â€™

â€˜And have you, sir,â€™ said the Major, â€˜when the rebels are about to spread
themselves through this country, actually left a great part of your
command at a fieldpreaching?â€™

Gilfillan again smiled scornfully as he made this indirect answer--â€˜Even
thus are the children of this world wiser in their generation than the
children of light!â€™

â€˜However, sir,â€™ said the Major, â€˜as you are to take charge of this
gentleman to Stirling, and deliver him, with these papers, into the hands
of Governor Blakeney, I beseech you to observe some rules of military
discipline upon your march. For example, I would advise you to keep your
men more closely together, and that each in his march should cover his
file-leader, instead of straggling like geese upon a common; and, for
fear of surprise, I further recommend to you to form a small
advance-party of your best men, with a single vidette in front of the
whole march, so that when you approach a village or a woodâ€™--(here the
Major interrupted himself)--â€˜But as I donâ€™t observe you listen to me, Mr.
Gilfillan, I suppose I need not give myself the trouble to say more upon
the subject. You are a better judge, unquestionably, than I am of the
measures to be pursued; but one thing I would have you well aware of,
that you are to treat this gentleman, your prisoner, with no rigour nor
incivility, and are to subject him to no other restraint than is
necessary for his security.â€™

â€˜I have looked into my commission,â€™ said Mr. Gilfillan,â€™ subscribed by a
worthy and professing nobleman, William, Earl of Glencairn; nor do I find
it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or commands anent my
doings from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan.â€™

Major Melville reddened even to the well-powdered ears which appeared
beneath his neat military sidecurls, the more so as he observed Mr.
Morton smile at the same moment. â€˜Mr. Gilfillan,â€™ he answered, with some
asperity, â€˜I beg ten thousand pardons for interfering with a person of
your importance. I thought, however, that as you have been bred a
grazier, if I mistake not, there might be occasion to remind you of the
difference between Highlanders and Highland cattle; and if you should
happen to meet with any gentleman who has seen service, and is disposed
to speak upon the subject, I should still imagine that listening to him
would do you no sort of harm. But I have done, and have only once more to
recommend this gentleman to your civility as well as to your custody. Mr.
Waverley, I am truly sorry we should part in this way; but I trust, when
you are again in this country, I may have an opportunity to render
Cairnvreckan more agreeable than circumstances have permitted on this
occasion.â€™

So saying, he shook our hero by the hand. Morton also took an
affectionate farewell, and Waverley, having mounted his horse, with a
musketeer leading it by the bridle and a file upon each side to prevent
his escape, set forward upon the march with Gilfillan and his party.
Through the little village they were accompanied with the shouts of the
children, who cried out, â€˜Eh! see to the Southland gentleman thatâ€™s gaun
to be hanged for shooting lang John Mucklewrath, the smith!




CHAPTER VII

AN INCIDENT


The dinner hour of Scotland Sixty Years Since was two oâ€™clock. It was
therefore about four oâ€™clock of a delightful autumn afternoon that Mr.
Gilfillan commenced his march, in hopes, although Stirling was eighteen
miles distant, he might be able, by becoming a borrower of the night for
an hour or two, to reach it that evening. He therefore put forth his
strength, and marched stoutly along at the head of his followers, eyeing
our hero from time to time, as if he longed to enter into controversy
with him. At length, unable to resist the temptation, he slackened his
pace till he was alongside of his prisonerâ€™s horse, and after marching a
few steps in silence abreast of him, he suddenly asked--â€˜Can ye say wha
the carle was wiâ€™ the black coat and the mousted head, that was wiâ€™ the
Laird of Cairnvreckan?â€™

â€˜A Presbyterian clergyman,â€™ answered Waverley.

â€˜Presbyterian!â€™ answered Gilfillan contemptuously; â€˜a wretched Erastian,
or rather an obscure Prelatist, a favourer of the black indulgence, ane
of thae dumb dogs that canna bark; they tell ower a clash oâ€™ terror and a
clatter oâ€™ comfort in their sermons, without ony sense, or savour, or
life. Yeâ€™ve been fed in siccan a fauld, belike?â€™

â€˜No; I am of the Church of England,â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜And theyâ€™re just neighbour-like,â€™ replied the Covenanter; â€˜and nae
wonder they gree sae weel. Wha wad hae thought the goodly structure of
the Kirk of Scotland, built up by our fathers in 1642, wad hae been
defaced by carnal ends and the corruptions of the time;--ay, wha wad hae
thought the carved work of the sanctuary would hae been sae soon cut
down!â€™

To this lamentation, which one or two of the assistants chorussed with a
deep groan, our hero thought it unnecessary to make any reply. Whereupon
Mr. Gilfillan, resolving that he should be a hearer at least, if not a
disputant, proceeded in his Jeremiade.

â€˜And now is it wonderful, when, for lack of exercise anent the call to
the service of the altar and the duty of the day, ministers fall into
sinful compliances with patronage, and indemnities, and oaths, and bonds,
and other corruptions,--is it wonderful, I say, that you, sir, and other
sic-like unhappy persons, should labour to build up your auld Babel of
iniquity, as in the bluidy persecuting saint-killing times? I trow, gin
ye werena blinded wiâ€™ the graces and favours, and services and
enjoyments, and employments and inheritances, of this wicked world, I
could prove to you, by the Scripture, in what a filthy rag ye put your
trust; and that your surplices, and your copes and vestments, are but
cast-off garments of the muckle harlot that sitteth upon seven hills and
drinketh of the cup of abomination. But, I trow, ye are deaf as adders
upon that side of the head; ay, ye are deceived with her enchantments,
and ye traffic with her merchandise, and ye are drunk with the cup of her
fornication!â€™

How much longer this military theologist might have continued his
invective, in which he spared nobody but the scattered remnant of
HILL-FOLK, as he called them, is absolutely uncertain. His matter was
copious, his voice powerful, and his memory strong; so that there was
little chance of his ending his exhortation till the party had reached
Stirling, had not his attention been attracted by a pedlar who had joined
the march from a cross-road, and who sighed or groaned with great
regularity at all fitting pauses of his homily.

â€˜And what may ye be, friend?â€™ said the Gifted Gilfillan.

â€˜A puir pedlar, thatâ€™s bound for Stirling, and craves the protection of
your honourâ€™s party in these kittle times. Ahâ€™ your honour has a notable
faculty in searching and explaining the secret,--ay, the secret and
obscure and incomprehensible causes of the backslidings of the land; ay,
your honour touches the root oâ€™ the matter.â€™

â€˜Friend,â€™ said Gilfillan, with a more complacent voice than he had
hitherto used, â€˜honour not me. I do not go out to park-dikes and to
steadings and to market-towns to have herds and cottars and burghers pull
off their bonnets to me as they do to Major Melville oâ€™ Cairnvreckan, and
caâ€™ me laird or captain or honour. No; my smaâ€™ means, whilk are not aboon
twenty thousand merk, have had the blessing of increase, but the pride of
my heart has not increased with them; nor do I delight to be called
captain, though I have the subscribed commission of that gospel-searching
nobleman, the Earl of Glencairn, fa whilk I am so designated. While I
live I am and will be called Habakkuk Gilfillan, who will stand up for
the standards of doctrine agreed on by the ance famous Kirk of Scotland,
before she trafficked with the accursed Achan, while he has a plack in
his purse or a drap oâ€™ bluid in his body.â€™

â€˜Ah,â€™ said the pedlar, â€˜I have seen your land about Mauchlin. A fertile
spot! your lines have fallen in pleasant places! And siccan a breed oâ€™
cattle is not in ony lairdâ€™s land in Scotland.â€™

â€˜Ye say right,--ye say right, friendâ€™ retorted Gilfillan eagerly, for he
was not inaccessible to flattery upon this subject,--â€˜ye say right; they
are the real Lancashire, and thereâ€™s no the like oâ€™ them even at the
mains of Kilmaursâ€™; and he then entered into a discussion of their
excellences, to which our readers will probably be as indifferent as our
hero. After this excursion the leader returned to his theological
discussions, while the pedlar, less profound upon those mystic points,
contented himself with groaning and expressing his edification at
suitable intervals.

â€˜What a blessing it would be to the puir blinded popish nations among
whom I hae sojourned, to have siccan a light to their paths! I hae been
as far as Muscovia in my smaâ€™ trading way, as a travelling merchant, and
I hae been through France, and the Low Countries, and aâ€™ Poland, and
maist feck oâ€™ Germany, and O! it would grieve your honourâ€™s soul to see
the murmuring and the singing and massing thatâ€™s in the kirk, and the
piping thatâ€™s in the quire, and the heathenish dancing and dicing upon
the Sabbath!â€™

This set Gilfillan off upon the Book of Sports and the Covenant, and the
Engagers, and the Protesters, and the Whiggamoreâ€™s Raid, and the Assembly
of Divines at Westminster, and the Longer and Shorter Catechism, and the
Excommunication at Torwood, and the slaughter of Archbishop Sharp. This
last topic, again, led him into the lawfulness of defensive arms, on
which subject he uttered much more sense than could have been expected
from some other parts of his harangue, and attracted even Waverleyâ€™s
attention, who had hitherto been lost in his own sad reflections. Mr.
Gilfillan then considered the lawfulness of a private manâ€™s standing
forth as the avenger of public oppression, and as he was labouring with
great earnestness the cause of Mas James Mitchell, who fired at the
Archbishop of Saint Andrews some years before the prelateâ€™s assassination
on Magus Muir, an incident occurred which interrupted his harangue.

The rays of the sun were lingering on the very verge of the horizon as
the party ascended a hollow and somewhat steep path which led to the
summit of a rising ground. The country was uninclosed, being part of a
very extensive heath or common; but it was far from level, exhibiting in
many places hollows filled with furze and broom; in others, little
dingles of stunted brushwood. A thicket of the latter description crowned
the hill up which the party ascended. The foremost of the band, being the
stoutest and most active, had pushed on, and, having surmounted the
ascent, were out of ken for the present. Gilfillan, with the pedlar and
the small party who were Waverleyâ€™s more immediate guard, were near the
top of the ascent, and the remainder straggled after them at a
considerable interval.

Such was the situation of matters when the pedlar, missing, as he said, a
little doggie which belonged to him, began to halt and whistle for the
animal. This signal, repeated more than once, gave offence to the rigour
of his companion, the rather because it appeared to indicate inattention
to the treasures of theological and controversial knowledge which were
pouring out for his edification. He therefore signified gruffly that he
could not waste his time in waiting for an useless cur.

â€˜But if your honour wad consider the case of Tobit--â€™

â€˜Tobit!â€™ exclaimed Gilffflan, with great heat; â€˜Tobit and his dog baith
are altogether heathenish and apocryphal, and none but a prelatist or a
papist would draw them into question. I doubt I hae been mistaâ€™en in you,
friend.â€™

â€˜Very likely,â€™ answered the pedlar, with great composure; â€˜but
neâ€™ertheless, I shall take leave to whistle again upon puir Bawty.â€™

This last signal was answered in an unexpected manner; for six or eight
stout Highlanders, who lurked among the copse and brushwood, sprung into
the hollow way and began to lay about them with their claymores.
Gilfillan, unappalled at this undesirable apparition, cried out manfully,
â€˜The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!â€™ and, drawing his broadsword, would
probably have done as much credit to the good old cause as any of its
doughty champions at Drumclog, when, behold! the pedlar, snatching a
musket from the person who was next him bestowed the butt of it with such
emphasis on the head of his late instructor in the Cameronian creed that
he was forthwith levelled to the ground. In the confusion which ensued
the horse which bore our hero was shot by one of Gilfillanâ€™s party, as he
discharged his firelock at random. Waverley fell with, and indeed under,
the animal, and sustained some severe contusions. But he was almost
instantly extricated from the fallen steed by two Highlanders, who, each
seizing him by the arm, hurried him away from the scuffle and from the
highroad. They ran with great speed, half supporting and half dragging
our hero, who could, however, distinguish a few dropping shots fired
about the spot which he had left. This, as he afterwards learned,
proceeded from Gilfillanâ€™s party, who had now assembled, the stragglers
in front and rear having joined the others. At their approach the
Highlanders drew off, but not before they had rifled Gilfillan and two of
his people, who remained on the spot grievously wounded. A few shots were
exchanged betwixt them and the Westlanders; but the latter, now without a
commander, and apprehensive of a second ambush, did not make any serious
effort to recover their prisoner, judging it more wise to proceed on
their journey to Stirling, carrying with them their wounded captain and
comrades.




CHAPTER VIII

WAVERLEY IS STILL IN DISTRESS


The velocity, and indeed violence, with which Waverley was hurried along
nearly deprived him of sensation; for the injury he had received from his
fall prevented him from aiding himself so effectually as he might
otherwise have done. When this was observed by his conductors, they
called to their aid two or three others of the party, and, swathing our
heroâ€™s body in one of their plaids, divided his weight by that means
among them, and transported him at the same rapid rate as before, without
any exertion of his own. They spoke little, and that in Gaelic; and did
not slacken their pace till they had run nearly two miles, when they
abated their extreme rapidity, but continued still to walk very fast,
relieving each other occasionally.

Our hero now endeavoured to address them, but was only answered with â€˜Cha
nâ€™eil Beurl agamâ€™ i.e. â€˜I have no English,â€™ being, as Waverley well knew,
the constant reply of a Highlander when he either does not understand or
does not choose to reply to an Englishman or Lowlander. He then mentioned
the name of Vich Ian Vohr, concluding that he was indebted to his
friendship for his rescue from the clutches of Gifted Gilfillan, but
neither did this produce any mark of recognition from his escort.

The twilight had given place to moonshine when the party halted upon the
brink of a precipitous glen, which, as partly enlightened by the
moonbeams, seemed full of trees and tangled brushwood. Two of the
Highlanders dived into it by a small foot-path, as if to explore its
recesses, and one of them returning in a few minutes, said something to
his companions, who instantly raised their burden and bore him, with
great attention and care, down the narrow and abrupt descent.
Notwithstanding their precautions, however, Waverleyâ€™s person came more
than once into contact, rudely enough, with the projecting stumps and
branches which overhung the pathway.

At the bottom of the descent, and, as it seemed, by the side of a brook
(for Waverley heard the rushing of a considerable body of water, although
its stream was invisible in the darkness), the party again stopped before
a small and rudely-constructed hovel. The door was open, and the inside
of the premises appeared as uncomfortable and rude as its situation and
exterior foreboded. There was no appearance of a floor of any kind; the
roof seemed rent in several places; the walls were composed of loose
stones and turf, and the thatch of branches of trees. The fire was in the
centre, and filled the whole wigwam with smoke, which escaped as much
through the door as by means of a circular aperture in the roof. An old
Highland sibyl, the only inhabitant of this forlorn mansion, appeared
busy in the preparation of some food. By the light which the fire
afforded Waverley could discover that his attendants were not of the clan
of Ivor, for Fergus was particularly strict in requiring from his
followers that they should wear the tartan striped in the mode peculiar
to their race; a mark of distinction anciently general through the
Highlands, and still maintained by those Chiefs who were proud of their
lineage or jealous of their separate and exclusive authority.

Edward had lived at Glennaquoich long enough to be aware of a distinction
which he had repeatedly heard noticed, and now satisfied that he had no
interest with his attendants, he glanced a disconsolate eye around the
interior of the cabin. The only furniture, excepting a washing-tub and a
wooden press, called in Scotland an ambry, sorely decayed, was a large
wooden bed, planked, as is usual, all around, and opening by a sliding
panel. In this recess the Highlanders deposited Waverley, after he had by
signs declined any refreshment. His slumbers were broken and
unrefreshing; strange visions passed before his eyes, and it required
constant and reiterated efforts of mind to dispel them. Shivering,
violent headache, and shooting pains in his limbs succeeded these
symptoms; and in the morning it was evident to his Highland attendants or
guard, for he knew not in which light to consider them, that Waverley was
quite unfit to travel.

After a long consultation among themselves, six of the party left the hut
with their arms, leaving behind an old and a young man. The former
addressed Waverley, and bathed the contusions, which swelling and livid
colour now made conspicuous. His own portmanteau, which the Highlanders
had not failed to bring off, supplied him with linen, and to his great
surprise was, with all its undiminished contents, freely resigned to his
use. The bedding of his couch seemed clean and comfortable, and his aged
attendant closed the door of the bed, for it had no curtain, after a few
words of Gaelic, from which Waverley gathered that he exhorted him to
repose. So behold our hero for a second time the patient of a Highland
Esculapius, but in a situation much more uncomfortable than when he was
the guest of the worthy Tomanrait.

The symptomatic fever which accompanied the injuries he had sustained did
not abate till the third day, when it gave way to the care of his
attendants and the strength of his constitution, and he could now raise
himself in his bed, though not without pain. He observed, however, that
there was a great disinclination on the part of the old woman who acted
as his nurse, as well as on that of the elderly Highlander, to permit the
door of the bed to be left open, so that he might amuse himself with
observing their motions; and at length, after Waverley had repeatedly
drawn open and they had as frequently shut the hatchway of his cage, the
old gentleman put an end to the contest by securing it on the outside
with a nail so effectually that the door could not be drawn till this
exterior impediment was removed.

While musing upon the cause of this contradictory spirit in persons whose
conduct intimated no purpose of plunder, and who, in all other points,
appeared to consult his welfare and his wishes, it occurred to our hero
that, during the worst crisis of his illness, a female figure, younger
than his old Highland nurse, had appeared to flit around his couch. Of
this, indeed, he had but a very indistinct recollection, but his
suspicions were confirmed when, attentively listening, he often heard, in
the course of the day, the voice of another female conversing in whispers
with his attendant. Who could it be? And why should she apparently desire
concealment? Fancy immediately aroused herself and turned to Flora
Mac-Ivor. But after a short conflict between his eager desire to believe
she was in his neighbourhood, guarding, like an angel of mercy, the couch
of his sickness, Waverley was compelled to conclude that his conjecture
was altogether improbable; since, to suppose she had left her
comparatively safe situation at Glennaquoich to descend into the Low
Country, now the seat of civil war, and to inhabit such a lurking-place
as this, was a thing hardly to be imagined. Yet his heart bounded as he
sometimes could distinctly hear the trip of a light female step glide to
or from the door of the hut, or the suppressed sounds of a female voice,
of softness and delicacy, hold dialogue with the hoarse inward croak of
old Janet, for so he understood his antiquated attendant was denominated.

Having nothing else to amuse his solitude, he employed himself in
contriving some plan to gratify his curiosity, in despite of the sedulous
caution of Janet and the old Highland janizary, for he had never seen the
young fellow since the first morning. At length, upon accurate
examination, the infirm state of his wooden prison-house appeared to
supply the means of gratifying his curiosity, for out of a spot which was
somewhat decayed he was able to extract a nail. Through this minute
aperture he could perceive a female form, wrapped in a plaid, in the act
of conversing with Janet. But, since the days of our grandmother Eve, the
gratification of inordinate curiosity has generally borne its penalty in
disappointment. The form was not that of Flora, nor was the face visible;
and, to crown his vexation, while he laboured with the nail to enlarge
the hole, that he might obtain a more complete view, a slight noise
betrayed his purpose, and the object of his curiosity instantly
disappeared, nor, so far as he could observe, did she again revisit the
cottage.

All precautions to blockade his view were from that time abandoned, and
he was not only permitted but assisted to rise, and quit what had been,
in a literal sense, his couch of confinement. But he was not allowed to
leave the hut; for the young Highlander had now rejoined his senior, and
one or other was constantly on the watch. Whenever Waverley approached
the cottage door the sentinel upon duty civilly, but resolutely, placed
himself against it and opposed his exit, accompanying his action with
signs which seemed to imply there was danger in the attempt and an enemy
in the neighbourhood. Old Janet appeared anxious and upon the watch; and
Waverley, who had not yet recovered strength enough to attempt to take
his departure in spite of the opposition of his hosts, was under the
necessity of remaining patient. His fare was, in every point of view,
better than he could have conceived, for poultry, and even wine, were no
strangers to his table. The Highlanders never presumed to eat with him,
and, unless in the circumstance of watching him, treated him with great
respect. His sole amusement was gazing from the window, or rather the
shapeless aperture which was meant to answer the purpose of a window,
upon a large and rough brook, which raged and foamed through a rocky
channel, closely canopied with trees and bushes, about ten feet beneath
the site of his house of captivity.

Upon the sixth day of his confinement Waverley found himself so well that
he began to meditate his escape from this dull and miserable
prison-house, thinking any risk which he might incur in the attempt
preferable to the stupefying and intolerable uniformity of Janetâ€™s
retirement. The question indeed occurred, whither he was to direct his
course when again at his own disposal. Two schemes seemed practicable,
yet both attended with danger and difficulty. One was to go back to
Glennaquoich and join Fergus Mac-Ivor, by whom he was sure to be kindly
received; and in the present state of his mind, the rigour with which he
had been treated fully absolved him, in his own eyes, from his allegiance
to the existing government. The other project was to endeavour to attain
a Scottish seaport, and thence to take shipping for England. His mind
wavered between these plans, and probably, if he had effected his escape
in the manner he proposed, he would have been finally determined by the
comparative facility by which either might have been executed. But his
fortune had settled that he was not to be left to his option.

Upon the evening of the seventh day the door of the hut suddenly opened,
and two Highlanders entered, whom Waverley recognised as having been a
part of his original escort to this cottage. They conversed for a short
time with the old man and his companion, and then made Waverley
understand, by very significant signs, that he was to prepare to
accompany them. This was a joyful communication. What had already passed
during his confinement made it evident that no personal injury was
designed to him; and his romantic spirit, having recovered during his
repose much of that elasticity which anxiety, resentment, disappointment,
and the mixture of unpleasant feelings excited by his late adventures had
for a time subjugated, was now wearied with inaction. His passion for the
wonderful, although it is the nature of such dispositions to be excited
by that degree of danger which merely gives dignity to the feeling of the
individual exposed to it, had sunk under the extraordinary and apparently
insurmountable evils by which he appeared environed at Cairnvreckan. In
fact, this compound of intense curiosity and exalted imagination forms a
peculiar species of courage, which somewhat resembles the light usually
carried by a miner--sufficiently competent, indeed, to afford him
guidance and comfort during the ordinary perils of his labour, but
certain to be extinguished should he encounter the more formidable hazard
of earth damps or pestiferous vapours. It was now, however, once more
rekindled, and with a throbbing mixture of hope, awe, and anxiety,
Waverley watched the group before him, as those who were just arrived
snatched a hasty meal, and the others assumed their arms and made brief
preparations for their departure.

As he sat in the smoky hut, at some distance from the fire, around which
the others were crowded, he felt a gentle pressure upon his arm. He
looked round; it was Alice, the daughter of Donald Bean Lean. She showed
him a packet of papers in such a manner that the motion was remarked by
no one else, put her finger for a second to her lips, and passed on, as
if to assist old Janet in packing Waverleyâ€™s clothes in his portmanteau.
It was obviously her wish that he should not seem to recognise her, yet
she repeatedly looked back at him, as an opportunity occurred of doing so
unobserved, and when she saw that he remarked what she did, she folded
the packet with great address and speed in one of his shirts, which she
deposited in the portmanteau.

Here then was fresh food for conjecture. Was Alice his unknown warden,
and was this maiden of the cavern the tutelar genius that watched his bed
during his sickness? Was he in the hands of her father? and if so, what
was his purpose? Spoil, his usual object, seemed in this case neglected;
for not only Waverleyâ€™s property was restored, but his purse, which might
have tempted this professional plunderer, had been all along suffered to
remain in his possession. All this perhaps the packet might explain; but
it was plain from Aliceâ€™s manner that she desired he should consult it in
secret. Nor did she again seek his eye after she had satisfied herself
that her manoeuvre was observed and understood. On the contrary, she
shortly afterwards left the hut, and it was only as she tript out from
the door, that, favoured by the obscurity, she gave Waverley a parting
smile and nod of significance ere she vanished in the dark glen.

The young Highlander was repeatedly despatched by his comrades as if to
collect intelligence. At length, when he had returned for the third or
fourth time, the whole party arose and made signs to our hero to
accompany them. Before his departure, however, he shook hands with old
Janet, who had been so sedulous in his behalf, and added substantial
marks of his gratitude for her attendance.

â€˜God bless you! God prosper you, Captain Waverley!â€™ said Janet, in good
Lowland Scotch, though he had never hithero heard her utter a syllable,
save in Gaelic. But the impatience of his attendants prohibited his
asking any explanation.




CHAPTER IX

A NOCTURNAL ADVENTURE


There was a momentâ€™s pause when the whole party had got out of the hut;
and the Highlander who assumed the command, and who, in Waverleyâ€™s
awakened recollection, seemed to be the same tall figure who had acted as
Donald Bean Leanâ€™s lieutenant, by whispers and signs imposed the
strictest silence. He delivered to Edward a sword and steel pistol, and,
pointing up the track, laid his hand on the hilt of his own claymore, as
if to make him sensible they might have occasion to use force to make
good their passage. He then placed himself at the head of the party, who
moved up the pathway in single or Indian file, Waverley being placed
nearest to their leader. He moved with great precaution, as if to avoid
giving any alarm, and halted as soon as he came to the verge of the
ascent. Waverley was soon sensible of the reason, for he heard at no
great distance an English sentinel call out â€˜Allâ€™s well.â€™ The heavy sound
sunk on the night-wind down the woody glen, and was answered by the
echoes of its banks. A second, third, and fourth time the signal was
repeated fainter and fainter, as if at a greater and greater distance. It
was obvious that a party of soldiers were near, and upon their guard,
though not sufficiently so to detect men skilful in every art of
predatory warfare, like those with whom he now watched their ineffectual
precautions.

When these sounds had died upon the silence of the night, the Highlanders
began their march swiftly, yet with the most cautious silence. Waverley
had little time, or indeed disposition, for observation, and could only
discern that they passed at some distance from a large building, in the
windows of which a light or two yet seemed to twinkle. A little farther
on the leading Highlander snuffed the wind like a setting spaniel, and
then made a signal to his party again to halt. He stooped down upon all
fours, wrapped up in his plaid, so as to be scarce distinguishable from
the heathy ground on which he moved, and advanced in this posture to
reconnoitre. In a short time he returned, and dismissed his attendants
excepting one; and, intimating to Waverley that he must imitate his
cautious mode of proceeding, all three crept forward on hands and knees.

After proceeding a greater way in this inconvenient manner than was at
all comfortable to his knees and shins, Waverley perceived the smell of
smoke, which probably had been much sooner distinguished by the more
acute nasal organs of his guide. It proceeded from the corner of a low
and ruinous sheep-fold, the walls of which were made of loose stones, as
is usual in Scotland. Close by this low wall the Highlander guided
Waverley, and, in order probably to make him sensible of his danger, or
perhaps to obtain the full credit of his own dexterity, he intimated to
him, by sign and example, that he might raise his head so as to peep into
the sheep-fold. Waverley did so, and beheld an outpost of four or five
soldiers lying by their watch-fire. They were all asleep except the
sentinel, who paced backwards and forwards with his firelock on his
shoulder, which glanced red in the light of the fire as he crossed and
re-crossed before it in his short walk, casting his eye frequently to
that part of the heavens from which the moon, hitherto obscured by mist,
seemed now about to make her appearance.

In the course of a minute or two, by one of those sudden changes of
atmosphere incident to a mountainous country, a breeze arose and swept
before it the clouds which had covered the horizon, and the night planet
poured her full effulgence upon a wide and blighted heath, skirted indeed
with copse-wood and stunted trees in the quarter from which they had
come, but open and bare to the observation of the sentinel in that to
which their course tended. The wall of the sheep-fold indeed concealed
them as they lay, but any advance beyond its shelter seemed impossible
without certain discovery.

The Highlander eyed the blue vault, but far from blessing the useful
light with Homerâ€™s, or rather Popeâ€™s benighted peasant, he muttered a
Gaelic curse upon the unseasonable splendour of MacFarlaneâ€™s buat (i.e.
lantern) [Footnote: See Note 26]. He looked anxiously around for a few
minutes, and then apparently took his resolution. Leaving his attendant
with Waverley, after motioning to Edward to remain quiet, and giving his
comrade directions in a brief whisper, he retreated, favoured by the
irregularity of the ground, in the same direction and in the same manner
as they had advanced. Edward, turning his head after him, could perceive
him crawling on all fours with the dexterity of an Indian, availing
himself of every bush and inequality to escape observation, and never
passing over the more exposed parts of his track until the sentinelâ€™s
back was turned from him. At length he reached the thickets and underwood
which partly covered the moor in that direction, and probably extended to
the verge of the glen where Waverley had been so long an inhabitant. The
Highlander disappeared, but it was only for a few minutes, for he
suddenly issued forth from a different part of the thicket, and,
advancing boldly upon the open heath as if to invite discovery, he
levelled his piece and fired at the sentinel. A wound in the arm proved a
disagreeable interruption to the poor fellowâ€™s meteorological
observations, as well as to the tune of â€˜Nancy Dawson,â€™ which he was
whistling. He returned the fire ineffectually, and his comrades, starting
up at the alarm, advanced alertly towards the spot from which the first
shot had issued. The Highlander, after giving them a full view of his
person, dived among the thickets, for his ruse de guerre had now
perfectly succeeded.

While the soldiers pursued the cause of their disturbance in one
direction, Waverley, adopting the hint of his remaining attendant, made
the best of his speed in that which his guide originally intended to
pursue, and which now (the attention of the soldiers being drawn to a
different quarter) was unobserved and unguarded. When they had run about
a quarter of a mile, the brow of a rising ground which they had
surmounted concealed them from further risk of observation. They still
heard, however, at a distance the shouts of the soldiers as they hallooed
to each other upon the heath, and they could also hear the distant roll
of a drum beating to arms in the same direction. But these hostile sounds
were now far in their rear, and died away upon the breeze as they rapidly
proceeded.

When they had walked about half an hour, still along open and waste
ground of the same description, they came to the stump of an ancient oak,
which, from its relics, appeared to have been at one time a tree of very
large size. In an adjacent hollow they found several Highlanders, with a
horse or two. They had not joined them above a few minutes, which
Waverleyâ€™s attendant employed, in all probability, in communicating the
cause of their delay (for the words â€˜Duncan Durochâ€™ were often repeated),
when Duncan himself appeared, out of breath indeed, and with all the
symptoms of having run for his life, but laughing, and in high spirits at
the success of the stratagem by which he had baffled his pursuers. This
indeed Waverley could easily conceive might be a matter of no great
difficulty to the active mountaineer, who was perfectly acquainted with
the ground, and traced his course with a firmness and confidence to which
his pursuers must have been strangers. The alarm which he excited seemed
still to continue, for a dropping shot or two were heard at a great
distance, which seemed to serve as an addition to the mirth of Duncan and
his comrades.

The mountaineer now resumed the arms with which he had entrusted our
hero, giving him to understand that the dangers of the journey were
happily surmounted. Waverley was then mounted upon one of the horses, a
change which the fatigue of the night and his recent illness rendered
exceedingly acceptable. His portmanteau was placed on another pony,
Duncan mounted a third, and they set forward at a round pace, accompanied
by their escort. No other incident marked the course of that nightâ€™s
journey, and at the dawn of morning they attained the banks of a rapid
river. The country around was at once fertile and romantic. Steep banks
of wood were broken by corn-fields, which this year presented an abundant
harvest, already in a great measure cut down.

On the opposite bank of the river, and partly surrounded by a winding of
its stream, stood a large and massive castle, the half-ruined turrets of
which were already glittering in the first rays of the sun. [Footnote:
See Note 27.] It was in form an oblong square, of size sufficient to
contain a large court in the centre. The towers at each angle of the
square rose higher than the walls of the building, and were in their turn
surmounted by turrets, differing in height and irregular in shape. Upon
one of these a sentinel watched, whose bonnet and plaid, streaming in the
wind, declared him to be a Highlander, as a broad white ensign, which
floated from another tower, announced that the garrison was held by the
insurgent adherents of the House of Stuart.

Passing hastily through a small and mean town, where their appearance
excited neither surprise nor curiosity in the few peasants whom the
labours of the harvest began to summon from their repose, the party
crossed an ancient and narrow bridge of several arches, and, turning to
the left up an avenue of huge old sycamores, Waverley found himself in
front of the gloomy yet picturesque structure which he had admired at a
distance. A huge iron-grated door, which formed the exterior defence of
the gateway, was already thrown back to receive them; and a second,
heavily constructed of oak and studded thickly with iron nails, being
next opened, admitted them into the interior court-yard. A gentleman,
dressed in the Highland garb and having a white cockade in his bonnet,
assisted Waverley to dismount from his horse, and with much courtesy bid
him welcome to the castle.

The governor, for so we must term him, having conducted Waverley to a
half-ruinous apartment, where, however, there was a small camp-bed, and
having offered him any refreshment which he desired, was then about to
leave him.

â€˜Will you not add to your civilities,â€™ said Waverley, after having made
the usual acknowledgment, â€˜by having the kindness to inform me where I
am, and whether or not I am to consider myself as a prisoner?â€™

â€˜I am not at liberty to be so explicit upon this subject as I could wish.
Briefly, however, you are in the Castle of Doune, in the district of
Menteith, and in no danger whatever.â€™

â€˜And how am I assured of that?â€™

â€˜By the honour of Donald Stewart, governor of the garrison, and
lieutenant-colonel in the service of his Royal Highness Prince Charles
Edward.â€™ So saying, he hastily left the apartment, as if to avoid further
discussion.

Exhausted by the fatigues of the night, our hero now threw himself upon
the bed, and was in a few minutes fast asleep.




CHAPTER X

THE JOURNEY IS CONTINUED


Before Waverley awakened from his repose, the day was far advanced, and
he began to feel that he had passed many hours without food. This was
soon supplied in form of a copious breakfast, but Colonel Stewart, as if
wishing to avoid the queries of his guest, did not again present himself.
His compliments were, however, delivered by a servant, with an offer to
provide anything in his power that could be useful to Captain Waverley on
his journey, which he intimated would be continued that evening. To
Waverleyâ€™s further inquiries, the servant opposed the impenetrable
barrier of real or affected ignorance and stupidity. He removed the table
and provisions, and Waverley was again consigned to his own meditations.

As he contemplated the strangeness of his fortune, which seemed to
delight in placing him at the disposal of others, without the power of
directing his own motions, Edwardâ€™s eye suddenly rested upon his
portmanteau, which had been deposited in his apartment during his sleep.
The mysterious appearance of Alice in the cottage of the glen immediately
rushed upon his mind, and he was about to secure and examine the packet
which she had deposited among his clothes, when the servant of Colonel
Stewart again made his appearance, and took up the portmanteau upon his
shoulders.

â€˜May I not take out a change of linen, my friend?â€™

â€˜Your honour sall get ane oâ€™ the Colonelâ€™s ain ruffled sarks, but this
maun gang in the baggage-cart.â€™

And so saying, he very coolly carried off the portmanteau, without
waiting further remonstrance, leaving our hero in a state where
disappointment and indignation struggled for the mastery. In a few
minutes he heard a cart rumble out of the rugged court-yard, and made no
doubt that he was now dispossessed, for a space at least, if not for
ever, of the only documents which seemed to promise some light upon the
dubious events which had of late influenced his destiny. With such
melancholy thoughts he had to beguile about four or five hours of
solitude.

When this space was elapsed, the trampling of horse was heard in the
court-yard, and Colonel Stewart soon after made his appearance to request
his guest to take some further refreshment before his departure. The
offer was accepted, for a late breakfast had by no means left our hero
incapable of doing honour to dinner, which was now presented. The
conversation of his host was that of a plain country gentleman, mixed
with some soldier-like sentiments and expressions. He cautiously avoided
any reference to the military operations or civil politics of the time;
and to Waverleyâ€™s direct inquiries concerning some of these points
replied, that he was not at liberty to speak upon such topics.

When dinner was finished the governor arose, and, wishing Edward a good
journey, said that, having been informed by Waverleyâ€™s servant that his
baggage had been sent forward, he had taken the freedom to supply him
with such changes of linen as he might find necessary till he was again
possessed of his own. With this compliment he disappeared. A servant
acquainted Waverley an instant afterwards that his horse was ready.

Upon this hint he descended into the court-yard, and found a trooper
holding a saddled horse, on which he mounted and sallied from the portal
of Doune Castle, attended by about a score of armed men on horseback.
These had less the appearance of regular soldiers than of individuals who
had suddenly assumed arms from some pressing motive of unexpected
emergency. Their uniform, which was blue and red, an affected imitation
of that of French chasseurs, was in many respects incomplete, and sate
awkwardly upon those who wore it. Waverleyâ€™s eye, accustomed to look at a
well-disciplined regiment, could easily discover that the motions and
habits of his escort were not those of trained soldiers, and that,
although expert enough in the management of their horses, their skill was
that of huntsmen or grooms rather than of troopers. The horses were not
trained to the regular pace so necessary to execute simultaneous and
combined movements and formations; nor did they seem bitted (as it is
technically expressed) for the use of the sword. The men, however, were
stout, hardy-looking fellows, and might be individually formidable as
irregular cavalry. The commander of this small party was mounted upon an
excellent hunter, and, although dressed in uniform, his change of apparel
did not prevent Waverley from recognising his old acquaintance, Mr.
Falconer of Balmawhapple.

Now, although the terms upon which Edward had parted with this gentleman
were none of the most friendly, he would have sacrificed every
recollection of their foolish quarrel for the pleasure of enjoying once
more the social intercourse of question and answer, from which he had
been so long secluded. But apparently the remembrance of his defeat by
the Baron of Bradwardine, of which Edward had been the unwilling cause,
still rankled in the mind of the low-bred and yet proud laird. He
carefully avoided giving the least sign of recognition, riding doggedly
at the head of his men, who, though scarce equal in numbers to a
sergeantâ€™s party, were denominated Captain Falconerâ€™s troop, being
preceded by a trumpet, which sounded from time to time, and a standard,
borne by Cornet Falconer, the lairdâ€™s younger brother. The lieutenant, an
elderly man, had much the air of a low sportsman and boon companion; an
expression of dry humour predominated in his countenance over features of
a vulgar cast, which indicated habitual intemperance. His cocked hat was
set knowingly upon one side of his head, and while he whistled the â€˜Bob
of Dumblain,â€™ under the influence of half a mutchkin of brandy, he seemed
to trot merrily forward, with a happy indifference to the state of the
country, the conduct of the party, the end of the journey, and all other
sublunary matters whatever.

From this wight, who now and then dropped alongside of his horse,
Waverley hoped to acquire some information, or at least to beguile the
way with talk.

â€˜A fine evening, sir,â€™ was Edwardâ€™s salutation.

â€˜Ow, ay, sir! a braâ€™ night,â€™ replied the lieutenant, in broad Scotch of
the most vulgar description.

â€˜And a fine harvest, apparently,â€™ continued Waverley, following up his
first attack.

â€˜Ay, the aits will be got bravely in; but the farmers, deil burst them,
and the corn-mongers will make the auld price gude against them as has
horses till keep.â€™

â€˜You perhaps act as quartermaster, sir?â€™

â€˜Ay, quartermaster, riding-master, and lieutenant,â€™ answered this officer
of all work. â€˜And, to be sure, whaâ€™s fitter to look after the breaking
and the keeping of the poor beasts than mysell, that bought and sold
every ane oâ€™ them?â€™

â€˜And pray, sir, if it be not too great a freedom, may I beg to know where
we are going just now?â€™

â€˜A fuleâ€™s errand, I fear,â€™ answered this communicative personage.

â€˜In that case,â€™ said Waverley, determined not to spare civility, â€˜I
should have thought a person of your appearance would not have been found
on the road.â€™

â€˜Vera true, vera true, sir,â€™ replied the officer, â€˜but every why has its
wherefore. Ye maun ken, the laird there bought aâ€™ thir beasts frae me to
munt his troop, and agreed to pay for them according to the necessities
and prices of the time. But then he hadna the ready penny, and I hae been
advised his bond will not be worth a boddle against the estate, and then
I had aâ€™ my dealers to settle wiâ€™ at Martinmas; and so, as he very kindly
offered me this commission, and as the auld Fifteen [Footnote: The Judges
of the Supreme Court of Session in Scotland are proverbially termed among
the country people, The Fifteen.] wad never help me to my siller for
sending out naigs against the government, why, conscience! sir, I thought
my best chance for payment was eâ€™en to GAE OUT [Footnote: See Note 28.]
mysell; and ye may judge, sir, as I hae dealt aâ€™ my life in halters, I
think na mickle oâ€™ putting my craig in peril of a Saint John-stoneâ€™s
tippet.â€™

â€˜You are not, then, by profession a soldier?â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜Na, na; thank God,â€™ answered this doughty partizan, â€˜I wasna bred at sae
short a tether, I was brought up to hack and manger. I was bred a
horse-couper, sir; and if I might live to see you at Whitson-tryst, or at
Stagshawbank, or the winter fair at Hawick, and ye wanted a spanker that
would lead the field, Iâ€™se be caution I would serve ye easy; for Jamie
Jinker was neâ€™er the lad to impose upon a gentleman. Yeâ€™re a gentleman,
sir, and should ken a horseâ€™s points; ye see that through--ganging thing
that Balmawhappleâ€™s on; I selled her till him. She was bred out of
Lick-the-ladle, that wan the kingâ€™s plate at Caverton-Edge, by Duke
Hamiltonâ€™s White-Foot,â€™ etc., etc., etc.

But as Jinker was entered full sail upon the pedigree of Balmawhappleâ€™s
mare, having already got as far as great-grandsire and great-grand-dam,
and while Waverley was watching for an opportunity to obtain from him
intelligence of more interest, the noble captain checked his horse until
they came up, and then, without directly appearing to notice Edward, said
sternly to the genealogist, â€˜I thought, lieutenant, my orders were
preceese, that no one should speak to the prisoner?â€™

The metamorphosed horse-dealer was silenced of course, and slunk to the
rear, where he consoled himself by entering into a vehement dispute upon
the price of hay with a farmer who had reluctantly followed his laird to
the field rather than give up his farm, whereof the lease had just
expired. Waverley was therefore once more consigned to silence,
foreseeing that further attempts at conversation with any of the party
would only give Balmawhapple a wished-for opportunity to display the
insolence of authority, and the sulky spite of a temper naturally dogged,
and rendered more so by habits of low indulgence and the incense of
servile adulation.

In about two hoursâ€™ time the party were near the Castle of Stirling, over
whose battlements the union flag was brightened as it waved in the
evening sun. To shorten his journey, or perhaps to display his importance
and insult the English garrison, Balmawhapple, inclining to the right,
took his route through the royal park, which reaches to and surrounds the
rock upon which the fortress is situated.





With a mind more at ease Waverley could not have failed to admire the
mixture of romance and beauty which renders interesting the scene through
which he was now passing--the field which had been the scene of the
tournaments of old--the rock from which the ladies beheld the contest,
while each made vows for the success of some favourite knight--the towers
of the Gothic church, where these vows might be paid--and, surmounting
all, the fortress itself, at once a castle and palace, where valour
received the prize from royalty, and knights and dames closed the evening
amid the revelry of the dance, the song, and the feast. All these were
objects fitted to arouse and interest a romantic imagination.

But Waverley had other objects of meditation, and an incident soon
occurred of a nature to disturb meditation of any kind. Balmawhapple, in
the pride of his heart, as he wheeled his little body of cavalry round
the base of the Castle, commanded his trumpet to sound a flourish and his
standard to be displayed. This insult produced apparently some sensation;
for when the cavalcade was at such distance from the southern battery as
to admit of a gun being depressed so as to bear upon them, a flash of
fire issued from one of the embrazures upon the rock; and ere the report
with which it was attended could be heard, the rushing sound of a
cannon-ball passed over Balmawhappleâ€™s head, and the bullet, burying
itself in the ground at a few yardsâ€™ distance, covered him with the earth
which it drove up. There was no need to bid the party trudge. In fact,
every man, acting upon the impulse of the moment, soon brought Mr.
Jinkerâ€™s steeds to show their mettle, and the cavaliers, retreating with
more speed than regularity, never took to a trot, as the lieutenant
afterwards observed, until an intervening eminence had secured them from
any repetition of so undesirable a compliment on the part of Stirling
Castle. I must do Balmawhapple, however, the justice to say that he not
only kept the rear of his troop, and laboured to maintain some order
among them, but, in the height of his gallantry, answered the fire of the
Castle by discharging one of his horse-pistols at the battlements;
although, the distance being nearly half a mile, I could never learn that
this measure of retaliation was attended with any particular effect.

The travellers now passed the memorable field of Bannockburn and reached
the Torwood, a place glorious or terrible to the recollections of the
Scottish peasant, as the feats of Wallace or the cruelties of Wude Willie
Grime predominate in his recollection. At Falkirk, a town formerly famous
in Scottish history, and soon to be again distinguished as the scene of
military events of importance, Balmawhapple proposed to halt and repose
for the evening. This was performed with very little regard to military
discipline, his worthy quarter-master being chiefly solicitous to
discover where the best brandy might be come at. Sentinels were deemed
unnecessary, and the only vigils performed were those of such of the
party as could procure liquor. A few resolute men might easily have cut
off the detachment; but of the inhabitants some were favourable, many
indifferent, and the rest overawed. So nothing memorable occurred in the
course of the evening, except that Waverleyâ€™s rest was sorely interrupted
by the revellers hallooing forth their Jacobite songs, without remorse or
mitigation of voice.

Early in the morning they were again mounted and on the road to
Edinburgh, though the pallid visages of some of the troop betrayed that
they had spent a night of sleepless debauchery. They halted at
Linlithgow, distinguished by its ancient palace, which Sixty Years Since
was entire and habitable, and whose venerable ruins, NOT QUITE SIXTY
YEARS SINCE, very narrowly escaped the unworthy fate of being converted
into a barrack for French prisoners. May repose and blessings attend the
ashes of the patriotic statesman who, amongst his last services to
Scotland, interposed to prevent this profanation!

As they approached the metropolis of Scotland, through a champaign and
cultivated country, the sounds of war began to be heard. The distant yet
distinct report of heavy cannon, fired at intervals, apprized Waverley
that the work of destruction was going forward. Even Balmawhapple seemed
moved to take some precautions, by sending an advanced party in front of
his troop, keeping the main body in tolerable order, and moving steadily
forward.

Marching in this manner they speedily reached an eminence, from which
they could view Edinburgh stretching along the ridgy hill which slopes
eastward from the Castle. The latter, being in a state of siege, or
rather of blockade, by the northern insurgents, who had already occupied
the town for two or three days, fired at intervals upon such parties of
Highlanders as exposed themselves, either on the main street or elsewhere
in the vicinity of the fortress. The morning being calm and fair, the
effect of this dropping fire was to invest the Castle in wreaths of
smoke, the edges of which dissipated slowly in the air, while the central
veil was darkened ever and anon by fresh clouds poured forth from the
battlements; the whole giving, by the partial concealment, an appearance
of grandeur and gloom, rendered more terrific when Waverley reflected on
the cause by which it was produced, and that each explosion might ring
some brave manâ€™s knell.

Ere they approached the city the partial cannonade had wholly ceased.
Balmawhapple, however, having in his recollection the unfriendly greeting
which his troop had received from the battery at Stirling, had apparently
no wish to tempt the forbearance of the artillery of the Castle. He
therefore left the direct road, and, sweeping considerably to the
southward so as to keep out of the range of the cannon, approached the
ancient palace of Holyrood without having entered the walls of the city.
He then drew up his men in front of that venerable pile, and delivered
Waverley to the custody of a guard of Highlanders, whose officer
conducted him into the interior of the building.

A long, low, and ill-proportioned gallery, hung with pictures, affirmed
to be the portraits of kings, who, if they ever flourished at all, lived
several hundred years before the invention of painting in oil colours,
served as a sort of guard chamber or vestibule to the apartments which
the adventurous Charles Edward now occupied in the palace of his
ancestors. Officers, both in the Highland and Lowland garb, passed and
repassed in haste, or loitered in the hall as if waiting for orders.
Secretaries were engaged in making out passes, musters, and returns. All
seemed busy, and earnestly intent upon something of importance; but
Waverley was suffered to remain seated in the recess of a window,
unnoticed by any one, in anxious reflection upon the crisis of his fate,
which seemed now rapidly approaching.




CHAPTER XI

AN OLD AND A NEW ACQUAINTANCE


While he was deep sunk in his reverie, the rustle of tartans was heard
behind him, a friendly arm clasped his shoulders, and a friendly voice
exclaimed,

â€˜Said the Highland prophet sooth? Or must second-sight go for nothing?â€™

Waverley turned, and was warmly embraced by Fergus Mac-Ivor. â€˜A thousand
welcomes to Holyrood, once more possessed by her legitimate sovereign!
Did I not say we should prosper, and that you would fall into the hands
of the Philistines if you parted from us?â€™

â€˜Dear Fergus!â€™ said Waverley, eagerly returning his greeting. â€˜It is long
since I have heard a friendâ€™s voice. Where is Flora?â€™

â€˜Safe, and a triumphant spectator of our success.â€™

â€˜In this place?â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜Ay, in this city at least,â€™ answered his friend, â€˜and you shall see her;
but first you must meet a friend whom you little think of, who has been
frequent in his inquiries after you.â€™

Thus saying, he dragged Waverley by the arm out of the guard chamber,
and, ere he knew where he was conducted, Edward found himself in a
presence room, fitted up with some attempt at royal state.

A young man, wearing his own fair hair, distinguished by the dignity of
his mien and the noble expression of his well-formed and regular
features, advanced out of a circle of military gentlemen and Highland
chiefs by whom he was surrounded. In his easy and graceful manners
Waverley afterwards thought he could have discovered his high birth and
rank, although the star on his breast and the embroidered garter at his
knee had not appeared as its indications.

â€˜Let me present to your Royal Highness,â€™ said Fergus, bowing profoundly--

â€˜The descendant of one of the most ancient and loyal families in
England,â€™ said the young Chevalier, interrupting him. â€˜I beg your pardon
for interrupting you, my dear Mac-Ivor; but no master of ceremonies is
necessary to present a Waverley to a Stuart.â€™

Thus saying, he extended his hand to Edward with the utmost courtesy, who
could not, had he desired it, have avoided rendering him the homage which
seemed due to his rank, and was certainly the right of his birth. â€˜I am
sorry to understand, Mr. Waverley, that, owing to circumstances which
have been as yet but ill explained, you have suffered some restraint
among my followers in Perthshire and on your march here; but we are in
such a situation that we hardly know our friends, and I am even at this
moment uncertain whether I can have the pleasure of considering Mr.
Waverley as among mine.â€™

He then paused for an instant; but before Edward could adjust a suitable
reply, or even arrange his ideas as to its purport, the Prince took out a
paper and then proceeded:--â€˜I should indeed have no doubts upon this
subject if I could trust to this proclamation, set forth by the friends
of the Elector of Hanover, in which they rank Mr. Waverley among the
nobility and gentry who are menaced with the pains of high-treason for
loyalty to their legitimate sovereign. But I desire to gain no adherents
save from affection and conviction; and if Mr. Waverley inclines to
prosecute his journey to the south, or to join the forces of the Elector,
he shall have my passport and free permission to do so; and I can only
regret that my present power will not extend to protect him against the
probable consequences of such a measure. But,â€™ continued Charles Edward,
after another short pause, â€˜if Mr. Waverley should, like his ancestor,
Sir Nigel, determine to embrace a cause which has little to recommend it
but its justice, and follow a prince who throws himself upon the
affections of his people to recover the throne of his ancestors or perish
in the attempt, I can only say, that among these nobles and gentlemen he
will find worthy associates in a gallant enterprise, and will follow a
master who may be unfortunate, but, I trust, will never be ungrateful.â€™

The politic Chieftain of the race of Ivor knew his advantage in
introducing Waverley to this personal interview with the royal
adventurer. Unaccustomed to the address and manners of a polished court,
in which Charles was eminently skilful, his words and his kindness
penetrated the heart of our hero, and easily outweighed all prudential
motives. To be thus personally solicited for assistance by a prince whose
form and manners, as well as the spirit which he displayed in this
singular enterprise, answered his ideas of a hero of romance; to be
courted by him in the ancient halls of his paternal palace, recovered by
the sword which he was already bending towards other conquests, gave
Edward, in his own eyes, the dignity and importance which he had ceased
to consider as his attributes. Rejected, slandered, and threatened upon
the one side, he was irresistibly attracted to the cause which the
prejudices of education and the political principles of his family had
already recommended as the most just. These thoughts rushed through his
mind like a torrent, sweeping before them every consideration of an
opposite tendency,--the time, besides, admitted of no deliberation,--and
Waverley, kneeling to Charles Edward, devoted his heart and sword to the
vindication of his rights!

The Prince (for, although unfortunate in the faults and follies of his
forefathers, we shall here and elsewhere give him the title due to his
birth) raised Waverley from the ground and embraced him with an
expression of thanks too warm not to be genuine. He also thanked Fergus
Mac-Ivor repeatedly for having brought him such an adherent, and
presented Waverley to the various noblemen, chieftains, and officers who
were about his person as a young gentleman of the highest hopes and
prospects, in whose bold and enthusiastic avowal of his cause they might
see an evidence of the sentiments of the English families of rank at this
important crisis. [Footnote: See Note 29.] Indeed, this was a point much
doubted among the adherents of the house of Stuart; and as a well-founded
disbelief in the cooperation of the English Jacobites kept many Scottish
men of rank from his standard, and diminished the courage of those who
had joined it, nothing could be more seasonable for the Chevalier than
the open declaration in his favour of the representative of the house of
Waverley-Honour, so long known as Cavaliers and Royalists. This Fergus
had foreseen from the beginning. He really loved Waverley, because their
feelings and projects never thwarted each other; he hoped to see him
united with Flora, and he rejoiced that they were effectually engaged in
the same cause. But, as we before hinted, he also exulted as a politician
in beholding secured to his party a partizan of such consequence; and he
was far from being insensible to the personal importance which he himself
gained with the Prince from having so materially assisted in making the
acquisition.

Charles Edward, on his part, seemed eager to show his attendants the
value which he attached to his new adherent, by entering immediately, as
in confidence, upon the circumstances of his situation. â€˜You have been
secluded so much from intelligence, Mr. Waverley, from causes of which I
am but indistinctly informed, that I presume you are even yet
unacquainted with the important particulars of my present situation. You
have, however, heard of my landing in the remote district of Moidart,
with only seven attendants, and of the numerous chiefs and clans whose
loyal enthusiasm at once placed a solitary adventurer at the head of a
gallant army. You must also, I think, have learned that the
commander-in-chief of the Hanoverian Elector, Sir John Cope, marched into
the Highlands at the head of a numerous and well-appointed military force
with the intention of giving us battle, but that his courage failed him
when we were within three hoursâ€™ march of each other, so that he fairly
gave us the slip and marched northward to Aberdeen, leaving the Low
Country open and undefended. Not to lose so favourable an opportunity, I
marched on to this metropolis, driving before me two regiments of horse,
Gardinerâ€™s and Hamiltonâ€™s, who had threatened to cut to pieces every
Highlander that should venture to pass Stirling; and while discussions
were carrying forward among the magistracy and citizens of Edinburgh
whether they should defend themselves or surrender, my good friend
Lochiel (laying his hand on the shoulder of that gallant and accomplished
chieftain) saved them the trouble of farther deliberation by entering the
gates with five hundred Camerons. Thus far, therefore, we have done well;
but, in the meanwhile, this doughty generalâ€™s nerves being braced by the
keen air of Aberdeen, he has taken shipping for Dunbar, and I have just
received certain information that he landed there yesterday. His purpose
must unquestionably be to march towards us to recover possession of the
capital. Now there are two opinions in my council of war: one, that being
inferior probably in numbers, and certainly in discipline and military
appointments, not to mention our total want of artillery and the weakness
of our cavalry, it will be safest to fall back towards the mountains, and
there protract the war until fresh succours arrive from France, and the
whole body of the Highland clans shall have taken arms in our favour. The
opposite opinion maintains, that a retrograde movement, in our
circumstances, is certain to throw utter discredit on our arms and
undertaking; and, far from gaining us new partizans, will be the means of
disheartening those who have joined our standard. The officers who use
these last arguments, among whom is your friend Fergus Mac-Ivor, maintain
that, if the Highlanders are strangers to the usual military discipline
of Europe, the soldiers whom they are to encounter are no less strangers
to their peculiar and formidable mode of attack; that the attachment and
courage of the chiefs and gentlemen are not to be doubted; and that, as
they will be in the midst of the enemy, their clansmen will as surely
follow them; in fine, that having drawn the sword we should throw away
the scabbard, and trust our cause to battle and to the God of battles.
Will Mr. Waverley favour us with his opinion in these arduous
circumstances?â€™

Waverley coloured high betwixt pleasure and modesty at the distinction
implied in this question, and answered, with equal spirit and readiness,
that he could not venture to offer an opinion as derived from military
skill, but that the counsel would be far the most acceptable to him which
should first afford him an opportunity to evince his zeal in his Royal
Highnessâ€™s service.

â€˜Spoken like a Waverley!â€™ answered Charles Edward; â€˜and that you may hold
a rank in some degree corresponding to your name, allow me, instead of
the captainâ€™s commission which you have lost, to offer you the brevet
rank of major in my service, with the advantage of acting as one of my
aides-de-camp until you can be attached to a regiment, of which I hope
several will be speedily embodied.â€™

â€˜Your Royal Highness will forgive me,â€™ answered Waverley (for his
recollection turned to Balmawhapple and his scanty troop), â€˜if I decline
accepting any rank until the time and place where I may have interest
enough to raise a sufficient body of men to make my command useful to
your Royal Highnessâ€™s service. In the meanwhile, I hope for your
permission to serve as a volunteer under my friend Fergus Mac-Ivor.â€™

â€˜At least,â€™ said the Prince, who was obviously pleased with this
proposal, â€˜allow me the pleasure of arming you after the Highland
fashion.â€™ With these words, he unbuckled the broadsword which he wore,
the belt of which was plaited with silver, and the steel basket-hilt
richly and curiously inlaid. â€˜The blade,â€™ said the Prince, â€˜is a genuine
Andrea Ferrara; it has been a sort of heirloom in our family; but I am
convinced I put it into better hands than my own, and will add to it
pistols of the same workmanship. Colonel Mac-Ivor, you must have much to
say to your friend; I will detain you no longer from your private
conversation; but remember we expect you both to attend us in the
evening. It may be perhaps the last night we may enjoy in these halls,
and as we go to the field with a clear conscience, we will spend the eve
of battle merrily.â€™

Thus licensed, the Chief and Waverley left the presence-chamber.




CHAPTER XII

THE MYSTERY BEGINS TO BE CLEARED UP


â€˜How do you like him?â€™ was Fergusâ€™s first question, as they descended the
large stone staircase.

â€˜A prince to live and die underâ€™ was Waverleyâ€™s enthusiastic answer.

â€˜I knew you would think so when you saw him, and I intended you should
have met earlier, but was prevented by your sprain. And yet he has his
foibles, or rather he has difficult cards to play, and his Irish
officers, [Footnote: See Note 30.] who are much about him, are but sorry
advisers: they cannot discriminate among the numerous pretensions that
are set up. Would you think it--I have been obliged for the present to
suppress an earlâ€™s patent, granted for services rendered ten years ago,
for fear of exciting the jealousy, forsooth, of C----and M----? But you
were very right, Edward, to refuse the situation of aide-de-camp. There
are two vacant, indeed, but Clanronald and Lochiel, and almost all of us,
have requested one for young Aberchallader, and the Lowlanders and the
Irish party are equally desirous to have the other for the master of F--.
Now, if either of these candidates were to be superseded in your favour,
you would make enemies. And then I am surprised that the Prince should
have offered you a majority, when he knows very well that nothing short
of lieutenant-colonel will satisfy others, who cannot bring one hundred
and fifty men to the field. â€œBut patience, cousin, and shuffle the
cards!â€ It is all very well for the present, and we must have you
properly equipped for the evening in your new costume; for, to say truth,
your outward man is scarce fit for a court.â€™

â€˜Why,â€™ said Waverley, looking at his soiled dress, â€˜my shooting jacket has
seen service since we parted; but that probably you, my friend, know as
well or better than I.â€™

â€˜You do my second-sight too much honour,â€™ said Fergus. â€˜We were so busy,
first with the scheme of giving battle to Cope, and afterwards with our
operations in the Lowlands, that I could only give general directions to
such of our people as were left in Perthshire to respect and protect you,
should you come in their way. But let me hear the full story of your
adventures, for they have reached us in a very partial and mutilated
manner.â€™

Waverley then detailed at length the circumstances with which the reader
is already acquainted, to which Fergus listened with great attention. By
this time they had reached the door of his quarters, which he had taken
up in a small paved court, retiring from the street called the Canongate,
at the house of a buxom widow of forty, who seemed to smile very
graciously upon the handsome young Chief, she being a person with whom
good looks and good-humour were sure to secure an interest, whatever
might be the partyâ€™s â€œpolitical opinionsâ€. Here Callum Beg received them
with a smile of recognition. â€˜Callum,â€™ said the Chief, â€˜call Shemus an
Snachadâ€™ (James of the Needle). This was the hereditary tailor of Vich
Ian Vohr. â€˜Shemus, Mr. Waverley is to wear the cath dath (battle colour,
or tartan); his trews must be ready in four hours. You know the measure
of a well-made man--two double nails to the small of the leg--â€™

â€˜Eleven from haunch to heel, seven round the waist. I give your honour
leave to hang Shemus, if thereâ€™s a pair of sheers in the Highlands that
has a baulder sneck than herâ€™s ain at the cumadh an truaisâ€™ (shape of the
trews).

â€˜Get a plaid of Mac-Ivor tartan and sash,â€™ continued the Chieftain, â€˜and
a blue bonnet of the Princeâ€™s pattern, at Mr. Mouatâ€™s in the Crames. My
short green coat, with silver lace and silver buttons, will fit him
exactly, and I have never worn it. Tell Ensign Maccombich to pick out a
handsome target from among mine. The Prince has given Mr. Waverley
broadsword and pistols, I will furnish him with a dirk and purse; add but
a pair of low-heeled shoes, and then, my dear Edward (turning to him),
you will be a complete son of Ivor.â€™

These necessary directions given, the Chieftain resumed the subject of
Waverleyâ€™s adventures. â€˜It is plain,â€™ he said, â€˜that you have been in the
custody of Donald Bean Lean. You must know that, when I marched away my
clan to join the Prince, I laid my injunctions on that worthy member of
society to perform a certain piece of service, which done, he was to join
me with all the force he could muster. But, instead of doing so, the
gentleman, finding the coast clear, thought it better to make war on his
own account, and has scoured the country, plundering, I believe, both
friend and foe, under pretence of levying blackmail, sometimes as if by
my authority, and sometimes (and be cursed to his consummate impudence)
in his own great name! Upon my honour, if I live to see the cairn of
Benmore again, I shall be tempted to hang that fellow! I recognise his
hand particularly in the mode of your rescue from that canting rascal
Gilfillan, and I have little doubt that Donald himself played the part of
the pedlar on that occasion; but how he should not have plundered you, or
put you to ransom, or availed himself in some way or other of your
captivity for his own advantage, passes my judgment.â€™

â€˜When and how did you hear the intelligence of my confinement?â€™ asked
Waverley.

â€˜The Prince himself told me,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜and inquired very minutely
into your history. He then mentioned your being at that moment in the
power of one of our northern parties--you know I could not ask him to
explain particulars--and requested my opinion about disposing of you. I
recommended that you should be brought here as a prisoner, because I did
not wish to prejudice you farther with the English government, in case
you pursued your purpose of going southward. I knew nothing, you must
recollect, of the charge brought against you of aiding and abetting high
treason, which, I presume, had some share in changing your original plan.
That sullen, good-for-nothing brute, Balmawhapple, was sent to escort you
from Doune, with what he calls his troop of horse. As to his behaviour,
in addition to his natural antipathy to everything that resembles a
gentleman, I presume his adventure with Bradwardine rankles in his
recollection, the rather that I daresay his mode of telling that story
contributed to the evil reports which reached your quondam regiment.â€™

â€˜Very likely,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜but now surely, my dear Fergus, you may
find time to tell me something of Flora.â€™

â€˜Why,â€™ replied Fergus, â€˜I can only tell you that she is well, and
residing for the present with a relation in this city. I thought it
better she should come here, as since our success a good many ladies of
rank attend our military court; and I assure you that there is a sort of
consequence annexed to the near relative of such a person as Flora
Mac-Ivor, and where there is such a justling of claims and requests, a
man must use every fair means to enhance his importance.â€™

There was something in this last sentence which grated on Waverleyâ€™s
feelings. He could not bear that Flora should be considered as conducing
to her brotherâ€™s preferment by the admiration which she must
unquestionably attract; and although it was in strict correspondence with
many points of Fergusâ€™s character, it shocked him as selfish, and
unworthy of his sisterâ€™s high mind and his own independent pride. Fergus,
to whom such manoeuvres were familiar, as to one brought up at the French
court, did not observe the unfavourable impression which he had unwarily
made upon his friendâ€™s mind, and concluded by saying,â€™ that they could
hardly see Flora before the evening, when she would be at the concert and
ball with which the Princeâ€™s party were to be entertained. She and I had
a quarrel about her not appearing to take leave of you. I am unwilling to
renew it by soliciting her to receive you this morning; and perhaps my
doing so might not only be ineffectual, but prevent your meeting this
evening.â€™

While thus conversing, Waverley heard in the court, before the windows of
the parlour, a well-known voice. â€˜I aver to you, my worthy friend,â€™ said
the speaker, â€˜that it is a total dereliction of military discipline; and
were you not as it were a tyro, your purpose would deserve strong
reprobation. For a prisoner of war is on no account to be coerced with
fetters, or debinded in ergastulo, as would have been the case had you
put this gentleman into the pit of the peel-house at Balmawhapple. I
grant, indeed, that such a prisoner may for security be coerced in
carcere, that is, in a public prison.â€™

The growling voice of Balmawhapple was heard as taking leave in
displeasure, but the word â€˜land-louperâ€™ alone was distinctly audible. He
had disappeared before Waverley reached the house in order to greet the
worthy Baron of Bradwardine. The uniform in which he was now attired, a
blue coat, namely, with gold lace, a scarlet waistcoat and breeches, and
immense jack-boots, seemed to have added fresh stiffness and rigidity to
his tall, perpendicular figure; and the consciousness of military command
and authority had increased, in the same proportion, the self-importance
of his demeanour and the dogmatism of his conversation.

He received Waverley with his usual kindness, and expressed immediate
anxiety to hear an explanation of the circumstances attending the loss of
his commission in Gardinerâ€™s dragoons; â€˜not,â€™ he said, â€˜that he had the
least apprehension of his young friend having done aught which could
merit such ungenerous treatment as he had received from government, but
because it was right and seemly that the Baron of Bradwardine should be,
in point of trust and in point of power, fully able to refute all
calumnies against the heir of Waverley-Honour, whom he had so much right
to regard as his own son.â€™

Fergus Mac-Ivor, who had now joined them, went hastily over the
circumstances of Waverleyâ€™s story, and concluded with the flattering
reception he had met from the young Chevalier. The Baron listened in
silence, and at the conclusion shook Waverley heartily by the hand and
congratulated him upon entering the service of his lawful Prince. â€˜For,â€™
continued he, â€˜although it has been justly held in all nations a matter
of scandal and dishonour to infringe the sacramentum militare, and that
whether it was taken by each soldier singly, whilk the Romans denominated
per conjurationem, or by one soldier in name of the rest, yet no one ever
doubted that the allegiance so sworn was discharged by the dimissio, or
discharging of a soldier, whose case would be as hard as that of
colliers, salters, and other adscripti glebes, or slaves of the soil,
were it to be accounted otherwise. This is something like the brocard
expressed by the learned Sanchez in his work â€œDe Jure-jurandoâ€ which you
have questionless consulted upon this occasion. As for those who have
calumniated you by leasing-making, I protest to Heaven I think they have
justly incurred the penalty of the â€œMemnonia Lex,â€ also called â€œLex
Rhemnia,â€ which is prelected upon by Tullius in his oration â€œIn Verrem.â€
 I should have deemed, however, Mr. Waverley, that before destining
yourself to any special service in the army of the Prince, ye might have
inquired what rank the old Bradwardine held there, and whether he would
not have been peculiarly happy to have had your services in the regiment
of horse which he is now about to levy.â€™ Edward eluded this reproach by
pleading the necessity of giving an immediate answer to the Princeâ€™s
proposal, and his uncertainty at the moment whether his friend the Baron
was with the army or engaged upon service elsewhere.

This punctilio being settled, Waverley made inquiry after Miss
Bradwardine, and was informed she had come to Edinburgh with Flora
Mac-Ivor, under guard of a party of the Chieftainâ€™s men. This step was
indeed necessary, Tully-Veolan having become a very unpleasant, and even
dangerous, place of residence for an unprotected young lady, on account
of its vicinity to the Highlands, and also to one or two large villages
which, from aversion as much to the caterans as zeal for presbytery, had
declared themselves on the side of government, and formed irregular
bodies of partizans, who had frequent skirmishes with the mountaineers,
and sometimes attacked the houses of the Jacobite gentry in the braes, or
frontier betwixt the mountain and plain.

â€˜I would propose to you,â€™ continued the Baron, â€˜to walk as far as my
quarters in the Luckenbooths, and to admire in your passage the High
Street, whilk is, beyond a shadow of dubitation, finer than any street
whether in London or Paris. But Rose, poor thing, is sorely discomposed
with the firing of the Castle, though I have proved to her from Blondel
and Coehorn, that it is impossible a bullet can reach these buildings;
and, besides, I have it in charge from his Royal Highness to go to the
camp, or leaguer of our army, to see that the men do condamare vasa, that
is, truss up their bag and baggage for tomorrowâ€™s march.â€™

â€˜That will be easily done by most of us,â€™ said Mac-Ivor, laughing.

â€˜Craving your pardon, Colonel Mac-Ivor, not quite so easily as ye seem to
opine. I grant most of your folk left the Highlands expedited as it were,
and free from the incumbrance of baggage; but it is unspeakable the
quantity of useless sprechery which they have collected on their march. I
saw one fellow of yours (craving your pardon once more) with a pier-glass
upon his back.â€™

â€˜Ay,â€™ said Fergus, still in good-humour, â€˜he would have told you, if you
had questioned him, â€œa ganging foot is aye getting.â€ But come, my dear
Baron, you know as well as I that a hundred Uhlans, or a single troop of
Schmirschitzâ€™s Pandours, would make more havoc in a country than the
knight of the mirror and all the rest of our clans put together.â€™

â€˜And that is very true likewise,â€™ replied the Baron; â€˜they are, as the
heathen author says, ferociores in aspectu, mitiores in actu, of a horrid
and grim visage, but more benign in demeanour than their physiognomy or
aspect might infer. But I stand here talking to you two youngsters when I
should be in the Kingâ€™s Park.â€™

â€˜But you will dine with Waverley and me on your return? I assure you,
Baron, though I can live like a Highlander when needs must, I remember my
Paris education, and understand perfectly faire la meilleure chere.â€™

â€˜And wha the deil doubts it,â€™ quoth the Baron, laughing, â€˜when ye bring
only the cookery and the gude toun must furnish the materials? Weel, I
have some business in the toun too; but Iâ€™ll join you at three, if the
vivers can tarry so long.â€™

So saying, he took leave of his friends and went to look after the charge
which had been assigned him.




CHAPTER XIII

A SOLDIERâ€™S DINNER


James of the Needle was a man of his word when whisky was no party to the
contract; and upon this occasion Callum Beg, who still thought himself in
Waverleyâ€™s debt, since he had declined accepting compensation at the
expense of mine host of the Candlestickâ€™s person, took the opportunity of
discharging the obligation, by mounting guard over the hereditary tailor
of Sliochd nan Ivor; and, as he expressed himself, â€˜targed him tightlyâ€™
till the finishing of the job. To rid himself of this restraint, Shemusâ€™s
needle flew through the tartan like lightning; and as the artist kept
chanting some dreadful skirmish of Fin Macoul, he accomplished at least
three stitches to the death of every hero. The dress was, therefore, soon
ready, for the short coat fitted the wearer, and the rest of the apparel
required little adjustment.

Our hero having now fairly assumed the â€˜garb of old Gaul,â€™ well
calculated as it was to give an appearance of strength to a figure which,
though tall and well-made, was rather elegant than robust, I hope my fair
readers will excuse him if he looked at himself in the mirror more than
once, and could not help acknowledging that the reflection seemed that of
a very handsome young fellow. In fact, there was no disguising it. His
light-brown hair--for he wore no periwig, notwithstanding the universal
fashion of the time--became the bonnet which surmounted it. His person
promised firmness and agility, to which the ample folds of the tartan
added an air of dignity. His blue eye seemed of that kind,

Which melted in love, and which kindled in war;

and an air of bashfulness, which was in reality the effect of want of
habitual intercourse with the world, gave interest to his features,
without injuring their grace or intelligence.

â€˜Heâ€™s a pratty man, a very pratty man,â€™ said Evan Dhu (now Ensign
Maccombich) to Fergusâ€™s buxom landlady.

â€˜Heâ€™s vera weel,â€™ said the Widow Flockhart, â€˜but no naething sae
weel-farâ€™d as your colonel, ensign.â€™

â€˜I wasna comparing them,â€™ quoth Evan, â€˜nor was I speaking about his being
weel-favoured; but only that Mr. Waverley looks clean-made and deliver,
and like a proper lad oâ€™ his quarters, that will not cry barley in a
brulzie. And, indeed, heâ€™s gleg aneuch at the broadsword and target. I
hae played wiâ€™ him mysell at Glennaquoich, and sae has Vich Ian Vohr,
often of a Sunday afternoon.â€™

â€˜Lord forgie ye, Ensign Maccombich,â€™ said the alarmed Presbyterian; â€˜Iâ€™m
sure the colonel wad never do the like oâ€™ that!â€™

â€˜Hout! hout! Mrs. Flockhart,â€™ replied the ensign, â€˜weâ€™re young blude, ye
ken; and young saints, auld deils.â€™

â€˜But will ye fight wiâ€™ Sir John Cope the morn, Ensign Maccombich?â€™
demanded Mrs. Flockhart of her guest.

â€˜Troth Iâ€™se ensure him, an heâ€™ll bide us, Mrs. Flockhart,â€™ replied the
Gael.

â€˜And will ye face thae tearing chields, the dragoons, Ensign Maccombich?â€™
again inquired the landlady.

â€˜Claw for claw, as Conan said to Satan, Mrs. Flockhart, and the deevil
tak the shortest nails.â€™

â€˜And will the colonel venture on the bagganets himsell?â€™

â€˜Ye may swear it, Mrs. Flockhart; the very first man will he be, by Saint
Phedar.â€™

â€˜Merciful goodness! and if heâ€™s killed amang the redcoats!â€™ exclaimed the
soft-hearted widow.

â€˜Troth, if it should sae befall, Mrs. Flockhart, I ken ane that will no
be living to weep for him. But we maun aâ€™ live the day, and have our
dinner; and thereâ€™s Vich Ian Vohr has packed his dorlach, and Mr.
Waverleyâ€™s wearied wiâ€™ majoring yonder afore the muckle pier-glass; and
that grey auld stoor carle, the Baron oâ€™ Bradwardine that shot young
Ronald of Ballenkeiroch, heâ€™s coming down the close wiâ€™ that droghling
coghling bailie body they caâ€™ Macwhupple, just like the Laird oâ€™
Kittlegabâ€™s French cook, wiâ€™ his turnspit doggie trindling ahint him, and
I am as hungry as a gled, my bonny dow; sae bid Kate set on the brooâ€™,
and do ye put on your pinners, for ye ken Vich Ian Vohr winna sit down
till ye be at the head oâ€™ the table;--and dinna forget the pint bottle oâ€™
brandy, my woman.â€™

This hint produced dinner. Mrs. Flockhart, smiling in her weeds like the
sun through a mist, took the head of the table, thinking within herself,
perhaps, that she cared not how long the rebellion lasted that brought
her into company so much above her usual associates. She was supported by
Waverley and the Baron, with the advantage of the Chieftain vis-a-vis.
The men of peace and of war, that is, Bailie Macwheeble and Ensign
Maccombich, after many profound conges to their superiors and each other,
took their places on each side of the Chieftain. Their fare was
excellent, time, place, and circumstances considered, and Fergusâ€™s
spirits were extravagantly high. Regardless of danger, and sanguine from
temper, youth, and ambition, he saw in imagination all his prospects
crowned with success, and was totally indifferent to the probable
alternative of a soldierâ€™s grave. The Baron apologized slightly for
bringing Macwheeble. They had been providing, he said, for the expenses
of the campaign. â€˜And, by my faith,â€™ said the old man, â€˜as I think this
will be my last, so I just end where I began: I hae evermore found the
sinews of war, as a learned author calls the caisse militaire, mair
difficult to come by than either its flesh, blood, or bones.â€™

â€˜What! have you raised our only efficient body of cavalry and got ye none
of the louis-dâ€™or out of the Doutelle [Footnote: The Doutelle was an
armed vessel which brought a small supply of money and arms from France
for the use of the insurgents.] to help you?â€™

â€˜No, Glennaquoich; cleverer fellows have been before me.â€™

â€˜Thatâ€™s a scandal,â€™ said the young Highlander; â€˜but you will share what
is left of my subsidy; it will save you an anxious thought tonight, and
will be all one tomorrow, for we shall all be provided for, one way or
other, before the sun sets.â€™ Waverley, blushing deeply, but with great
earnestness, pressed the same request.

â€˜I thank ye baith, my good lads,â€™ said the Baron, â€˜but I will not
infringe upon your peculium. Bailie Macwheeble has provided the sum which
is necessary.â€™

Here the Bailie shifted and fidgeted about in his seat, and appeared
extremely uneasy. At length, after several preliminary hems, and much
tautological expression of his devotion to his honourâ€™s service, by night
or day, living or dead, he began to insinuate, â€˜that the banks had
removed aâ€™ their ready cash into the Castle; that, nae doubt, Sandie
Goldie, the silversmith, would do mickle for his honour; but there was
little time to get the wadset made out; and, doubtless, if his honour
Glennaquoich or Mr. Wauverley could accommodate--â€™

â€˜Let me hear of no such nonsense, sir,â€™ said the Baron, in a tone which
rendered Macwheeble mute, â€˜but proceed as we accorded before dinner, if
it be your wish to remain in my service.â€™

To this peremptory order the Bailie, though he felt as if condemned to
suffer a transfusion of blood from his own veins into those of the Baron,
did not presume to make any reply. After fidgeting a little while longer,
however, he addressed himself to Glennaquoich, and told him, if his
honour had mair ready siller than was sufficient for his occasions in the
field, he could put it out at use for his honour in safe hands and at
great profit at this time.

At this proposal Fergus laughed heartily, and answered, when he had
recovered his breath--â€˜Many thanks, Bailie; but you must know, it is a
general custom among us soldiers to make our landlady our banker. Here,
Mrs. Flockhart,â€™ said he, taking four or five broad pieces out of a
well-filled purse and tossing the purse itself, with its remaining
contents, into her apron, â€˜these will serve my occasions; do you take the
rest. Be my banker if I live, and my executor if I die; but take care to
give something to the Highland cailliachs [Footnote: Old women, on whom
devolved the duty of lamenting for the dead, which the Irish call
keening.] that shall cry the coronach loudest for the last Vich Ian
Vohr.â€™

â€˜It is the testamentum militare,â€™ quoth the Baron, â€˜whilk, amang the
Romans, was privilegiate to be nuncupative.â€™ But the soft heart of Mrs.
Flockhart was melted within her at the Chieftainâ€™s speech; she set up a
lamentable blubbering, and positively refused to touch the bequest, which
Fergus was therefore obliged to resume.

â€˜Well, then,â€™ said the Chief, â€˜if I fall, it will go to the grenadier
that knocks my brains out, and I shall take care he works hard for it.â€™

Bailie Macwheeble was again tempted to put in his oar; for where cash was
concerned he did not willingly remain silent. â€˜Perhaps he had better
carry the gowd to Miss Mac-Ivor, in case of mortality or accidents of
war. It might tak the form of a mortis causa donation in the young
leddieâ€™s favour, and--wad cost but the scrape of a pen to mak it out.â€™

â€˜The young lady,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜should such an event happen, will have
other matters to think of than these wretched louis-dâ€™or.â€™

â€˜True--undeniable--thereâ€™s nae doubt oâ€™ that; but your honour kens that a
full sorrow--â€™

â€˜Is endurable by most folk more easily than a hungry one? True, Bailie,
very true; and I believe there may even be some who would be consoled by
such a reflection for the loss of the whole existing generation. But
there is a sorrow which knows neither hunger nor thirst; and poor
Flora--â€™ He paused, and the whole company sympathised in his emotion.

The Baronâ€™s thoughts naturally reverted to the unprotected state of his
daughter, and the big tear came to the veteranâ€™s eye. â€˜If I fall,
Macwheeble, you have all my papers and know all my affairs; be just to
Rose.â€™

The Bailie was a man of earthly mould, after all; a good deal of dirt and
dross about him, undoubtedly, but some kindly and just feelings he had,
especially where the Baron or his young mistress were concerned. He set
up a lamentable howl. â€˜If that doleful day should come, while Duncan
Macwheeble had a boddle it should be Miss Roseâ€™s. He wald scroll for a
plack the sheet or she kennâ€™d what it was to want; if indeed aâ€™ the
bonnie baronie oâ€™ Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, with the fortalice and
manor-place thereof (he kept sobbing and whining at every pause), tofts,
crofts, mosses, muirs--outfield, infield--buildings--orchards--dove-
cots--with the right of net and coble in the water and loch of Veolan--
teinds, parsonage and vicarage--annexis, connexis--rights of pasturage--
feul, feal and divot--parts, pendicles, and pertinents whatsoever--(here
he had recourse to the end of his long cravat to wipe his eyes, which
overflowed, in spite of him, at the ideas which this technical jargon
conjured up)--all as more fully described in the proper evidents and
titles thereof--and lying within the parish of Bradwardine and the shire
of Perth--if, as aforesaid, they must aâ€™ pass from my masterâ€™s child to
Inch-Grabbit, whaâ€™s a Whig and a Hanoverian, and be managed by his doer,
Jamie Howie, whaâ€™s no fit to be a birlieman, let be a bailie--â€™

The beginning of this lamentation really had something affecting, but the
conclusion rendered laughter irresistible. â€˜Never mind, Bailie,â€™ said
Ensign Maccombich, â€˜for the gude auld times of rugging and riving
(pulling and tearing) are come back again, anâ€™ Sneckus Mac-Snackus
(meaning, probably, annexis, connexis), and aâ€™ the rest of your friends,
maun gie place to the langest claymore.â€™

â€˜And that claymore shall be ours, Bailie,â€™ said the Chieftain, who saw
that Macwheeble looked very blank at this intimation.
    â€˜Weâ€™ll give them the metal our mountain affords,
        Lillibulero, bullen a la,
    And in place of broad-pieces, weâ€™ll pay with broadswords,
        Lero, lero, etc.
    With duns and with debts we will soon clear our score,
        Lillibulero, etc.
    For the man thatâ€™s thus paid will crave payment no more,
        Lero, lero, etc.
[Footnote: These lines, or something like them, occur in an old magazine
of the period.]

But come, Bailie, be not cast down; drink your wine with a joyous heart;
the Baron shall return safe and victorious to Tully-Veolan, and unite
Killancureitâ€™s lairdship with his own, since the cowardly half-bred swine
will not turn out for the Prince like a gentleman.â€™

â€˜To be sure, they lie maist ewest,â€™ said the Bailie, wiping his eyes,
â€˜and should naturally faâ€™ under the same factory.â€™

â€˜And I,â€™ proceeded the Chieftain, â€˜shall take care of myself, too; for you
must know, I have to complete a good work here, by bringing Mrs.
Flockhart into the bosom of the Catholic church, or at least half way,
and that is to your Episcopal meeting-house. O Baron! if you heard her
fine counter-tenor admonishing Kate and Matty in the morning, you, who
understand music, would tremble at the idea of hearing her shriek in the
psalmody of Haddoâ€™s Hole.â€™

â€˜Lord forgie you, colonel, how ye rin on! But I hope your honours will
tak tea before ye gang to the palace, and I maun gang and mask it for
you.â€™

So saying, Mrs. Flockhart left the gentlemen to their own conversation,
which, as might be supposed, turned chiefly upon the approaching events
of the campaign.




CHAPTER XIV

THE BALL


Ensign MacCombich having gone to the Highland camp upon duty, and Bailie
Macwheeble having retired to digest his dinner and Evan Dhuâ€™s intimation
of martial law in some blind change-house, Waverley, with the Baron and
the Chieftain, proceeded to Holyrood House. The two last were in full
tide of spirits, and the Baron rallied in his way our hero upon the
handsome figure which his new dress displayed to advantage. â€˜If you have
any design upon the heart of a bonny Scotch lassie, I would premonish
you, when you address her, to remember and quote the words of
Virgilius:--

    Nunc insanus amor duri me Martis in armis,
    Tela inter media atque adversos detinet hostes;

whilk verses Robertson of Struan, Chief of the Clan Donnochy (unless the
claims of Lude ought to be preferred primo loco), has thus elegantly
rendered:--

    For cruel love had gartanâ€™d low my leg,
    And clad my hurdies in a philabeg.

Although, indeed, ye wear the trews, a garment whilk I approve maist of
the twa, as mair ancient and seemly.â€™ â€˜Or rather,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜hear my
song:--

    She wadna hae a Lowland laird,
      Nor be an English lady;
    But sheâ€™s away with Duncan Grame,
      And heâ€™s rowâ€™d her in his plaidy.â€™

By this time they reached the palace of Holyrood, and were announced
respectively as they entered the apartments.

It is but too well known how many gentlemen of rank, education, and
fortune took a concern in the ill-fated and desperate undertaking of
1745. The ladies, also, of Scotland very generally espoused the cause of
the gallant and handsome young Prince, who threw himself upon the mercy
of his countrymen rather like a hero of romance than a calculating
politician. It is not, therefore, to be wondered that Edward, who had
spent the greater part of his life in the solemn seclusion of
Waverley-Honour, should have been dazzled at the liveliness and elegance
of the scene now exhibited in the long deserted halls of the Scottish
palace. The accompaniments, indeed, fell short of splendour, being such
as the confusion and hurry of the time admitted; still, however, the
general effect was striking, and, the rank of the company considered,
might well be called brilliant.

It was not long before the loverâ€™s eye discovered the object of his
attachment. Flora Mac-Ivor was in the act of returning to her seat, near
the top of the room, with Rose Bradwardine by her side. Among much
elegance and beauty, they had attracted a great degree of the public
attention, being certainly two of the handsomest women present. The
Prince took much notice of both, particularly of Flora, with whom he
danced, a preference which she probably owed to her foreign education and
command of the French and Italian languages.

When the bustle attending the conclusion of the dance permitted, Edward
almost intuitively followed Fergus to the place where Miss Mac-Ivor was
seated. The sensation of hope with which he had nursed his affection in
absence of the beloved object seemed to vanish in her presence, and, like
one striving to recover the particulars of a forgotten dream, he would
have given the world at that moment to have recollected the grounds on
which he had founded expectations which now seemed so delusive. He
accompanied Fergus with downcast eyes, tingling ears, and the feelings of
the criminal who, while the melancholy cart moves slowly through the
crowds that have assembled to behold his execution, receives no clear
sensation either from the noise which fills his ears or the tumult on
which he casts his wandering look. Flora seemed a little--a very
little--affected and discomposed at his approach. â€˜I bring you an adopted
son of Ivor,â€™ said Fergus.

â€˜And I receive him as a second brother,â€™ replied Flora.

There was a slight emphasis on the word, which would have escaped every
ear but one that was feverish with apprehension. It was, however,
distinctly marked, and, combined with her whole tone and manner, plainly
intimated, â€˜I will never think of Mr. Waverley as a more intimate
connexion.â€™ Edward stopped, bowed, and looked at Fergus, who bit his lip,
a movement of anger which proved that he also had put a sinister
interpretation on the reception which his sister had given his friend.
â€˜This, then, is an end of my day-dream!â€™ Such was Waverleyâ€™s first
thought, and it was so exquisitely painful as to banish from his cheek
every drop of blood.

â€˜Good God!â€™ said Rose Bradwardine, â€˜he is not yet recovered!â€™

These words, which she uttered with great emotion, were overheard by the
Chevalier himself, who stepped hastily forward, and, taking Waverley by
the hand, inquired kindly after his health, and added that he wished to
speak with him. By a strong and sudden effort; which the circumstances
rendered indispensable, Waverley recovered himself so far as to follow
the Chevalier in silence to a recess in the apartment.

Here the Prince detained him some time, asking various questions about
the great Tory and Catholic families of England, their connexions, their
influence, and the state of their affections towards the house of Stuart.
To these queries Edward could not at any time have given more than
general answers, and it may be supposed that, in the present state of his
feelings, his responses were indistinct even to confusion. The Chevalier
smiled once or twice at the incongruity of his replies, but continued the
same style of conversation, although he found himself obliged to occupy
the principal share of it, until he perceived that Waverley had recovered
his presence of mind. It is probable that this long audience was partly
meant to further the idea which the Prince desired should be entertained
among his followers, that Waverley was a character of political
influence. But it appeared, from his concluding expressions, that he had
a different and good-natured motive, personal to our hero, for prolonging
the conference. â€˜I cannot resist the temptation,â€™ he said, â€˜of boasting
of my own discretion as a ladyâ€™s confidant. You see, Mr. Waverley, that I
know all, and I assure you I am deeply interested in the affair. But, my
good young friend, you must put a more severe restraint upon your
feelings. There are many here whose eyes can see as clearly as mine, but
the prudence of whose tongues may not be equally trusted,â€™

So saying, he turned easily away and joined a circle of officers at a few
pacesâ€™ distance, leaving Waverley to meditate upon his parting
expression, which, though not intelligible to him in its whole purport,
was sufficiently so in the caution which the last word recommended.
Making, therefore, an effort to show himself worthy of the interest which
his new master had expressed, by instant obedience to his recommendation,
he walked up to the spot where Flora and Miss Bradwardine were still
seated, and having made his compliments to the latter, he succeeded, even
beyond his own expectation, in entering into conversation upon general
topics.

If, my dear reader, thou hast ever happened to take post-horses at----or
at----(one at least of which blanks, or more probably both, you will be
able to fill up from an inn near your own residence), you must have
observed, and doubtless with sympathetic pain, the reluctant agony with
which the poor jades at first apply their galled necks to the collars of
the harness. But when the irresistible arguments of the post-boy have
prevailed upon them to proceed a mile or two, they will become callous to
the first sensation; and being warm in the harness, as the said post-boy
may term it, proceed as if their withers were altogether unwrung. This
simile so much corresponds with the state of Waverleyâ€™s feelings in the
course of this memorable evening, that I prefer it (especially as being,
I trust, wholly original) to any more splendid illustration with which
Bysheâ€™s â€˜Art of Poetryâ€™ might supply me.

Exertion, like virtue, is its own reward; and our hero had, moreover,
other stimulating motives for persevering in a display of affected
composure and indifference to Floraâ€™s obvious unkindness. Pride, which
supplies its caustic as an useful, though severe, remedy for the wounds
of affection, came rapidly to his aid. Distinguished by the favour of a
prince; destined, he had room to hope, to play a conspicuous part in the
revolution which awaited a mighty kingdom; excelling, probably, in mental
acquirements, and equalling at least in personal accomplishments, most of
the noble and distinguished persons with whom he was now ranked; young,
wealthy, and high-born,--could he, or ought he, to droop beneath the
frown of a capricious beauty?

    O nymph, unrelenting and cold as thou art,
    My bosom is proud as thine own.

With the feeling expressed in these beautiful lines (which, however, were
not then written), [Footnote: They occur in Miss Sewardâ€™s fine verses,
beginning--â€˜To thy rocks, stormy Lannow, adieu.â€™] Waverley determined
upon convincing Flora that he was not to be depressed by a rejection in
which his vanity whispered that perhaps she did her own prospects as much
injustice as his. And, to aid this change of feeling, there lurked the
secret and unacknowledged hope that she might learn to prize his
affection more highly, when she did not conceive it to be altogether
within her own choice to attract or repulse it. There was a mystic tone
of encouragement, also, in the Chevalierâ€™s words, though he feared they
only referred to the wishes of Fergus in favour of an union between him
and his sister. But the whole circumstances of time, place, and incident
combined at once to awaken his imagination and to call upon him for a
manly and decisive tone of conduct, leaving to fate to dispose of the
issue. Should he appear to be the only one sad and disheartened on the
eve of battle, how greedily would the tale be commented upon by the
slander which had been already but too busy with his fame! Never, never,
he internally resolved, shall my unprovoked enemies possess such an
advantage over my reputation.

Under the influence of these mixed sensations, and cheered at times by a
smile of intelligence and approbation from the Prince as he passed the
group, Waverley exerted his powers of fancy, animation, and eloquence,
and attracted the general admiration of the company. The conversation
gradually assumed the tone best qualified for the display of his talents
and acquisitions. The gaiety of the evening was exalted in character,
rather than checked, by the approaching dangers of the morrow. All nerves
were strung for the future, and prepared to enjoy the present. This mood
of mind is highly favourable for the exercise of the powers of
imagination, for poetry, and for that eloquence which is allied to
poetry. Waverley, as we have elsewhere observed, possessed at times a
wonderful flow of rhetoric; and on the present occasion, he touched more
than once the higher notes of feeling, and then again ran off in a wild
voluntary of fanciful mirth. He was supported and excited by kindred
spirits, who felt the same impulse of mood and time; and even those of
more cold and calculating habits were hurried along by the torrent. Many
ladies declined the dance, which still went forward, and under various
pretences joined the party to which the â€˜handsome young Englishmanâ€™
seemed to have attached himself. He was presented to several of the first
rank, and his manners, which for the present were altogether free from
the bashful restraint by which, in a moment of less excitation, they were
usually clouded, gave universal delight.

Flora Mac-Ivor appeared to be the only female present who regarded him
with a degree of coldness and reserve; yet even she could not suppress a
sort of wonder at talents which, in the course of their acquaintance, she
had never seen displayed with equal brilliancy and impressive effect. I
do not know whether she might not feel a momentary regret at having taken
so decisive a resolution upon the addresses of a lover who seemed fitted
so well to fill a high place in the highest stations of society.
Certainly she had hitherto accounted among the incurable deficiencies of
Edwardâ€™s disposition the mauvaise honte which, as she had been educated
in the first foreign circles, and was little acquainted with the shyness
of English manners, was in her opinion too nearly related to timidity and
imbecility of disposition. But if a passing wish occurred that Waverley
could have rendered himself uniformly thus amiable and attractive, its
influence was momentary; for circumstances had arisen since they met
which rendered in her eyes the resolution she had formed respecting him
final and irrevocable.

With opposite feelings Rose Bradwardine bent her whole soul to listen.
She felt a secret triumph at the public tribute paid to one whose merit
she had learned to prize too early and too fondly. Without a thought of
jealousy, without a feeling of fear, pain, or doubt, and undisturbed by a
single selfish consideration, she resigned herself to the pleasure of
observing the general murmur of applause. When Waverley spoke, her ear
was exclusively filled with his voice, when others answered, her eye took
its turn of observation, and seemed to watch his reply. Perhaps the
delight which she experienced in the course of that evening, though
transient, and followed by much sorrow, was in its nature the most pure
and disinterested which the human mind is capable of enjoying.

â€˜Baron,â€™ said the Chevalier, â€˜I would not trust my mistress in the
company of your young friend. He is really, though perhaps somewhat
romantic, one of the most fascinating young men whom I have ever seen.â€™

â€˜And by my honour, sir,â€™ replied the Baron, â€˜the lad can sometimes be as
dowff as a sexagenary like myself. If your Royal Highness had seen him
dreaming and dozing about the banks of Tully-Veolan like an hypochondriac
person, or, as Burtonâ€™s â€œAnatomiaâ€ hath it, a phrenesiac or lethargic
patient, you would wonder where he hath sae suddenly acquired all this
fine sprack festivity and jocularity.â€™

â€˜Truly,â€™ said Fergus Mac-Ivor, â€˜I think it can only be the inspiration of
the tartans; for, though Waverley be always a young fellow of sense and
honour, I have hitherto often found him a very absent and inattentive
companion.â€™

â€˜We are the more obliged to him,â€™ said the Prince, â€˜for having reserved
for this evening qualities which even such intimate friends had not
discovered. But come, gentlemen, the night advances, and the business of
tomorrow must be early thought upon. Each take charge of his fair
partner, and honour a small refreshment with your company.â€™

He led the way to another suite of apartments, and assumed the seat and
canopy at the head of a long range of tables with an air of dignity,
mingled with courtesy, which well became his high birth and lofty
pretensions. An hour had hardly flown away when the musicians played the
signal for parting so well known in Scotland. [Footnote: Which is, or was
wont to be, the old air of â€˜Good-night and joy be wiâ€™ you aâ€™.]

â€˜Good-night, then,â€™ said the Chevalier, rising; â€˜goodnight, and joy be
with you! Good-night, fair ladies, who have so highly honoured a
proscribed and banished Prince! Good-night, my brave friends; may the
happiness we have this evening experienced be an omen of our return to
these our paternal halls, speedily and in triumph, and of many and many
future meetings of mirth and pleasure in the palace of Holyrood!â€™

When the Baron of Bradwardine afterwards mentioned this adieu of the
Chevalier, he never failed to repeat, in a melancholy tone,

   â€˜Audiit, et voti Phoebus succedere partem
    Mente dedit; partem volucres dispersit in auras;

which,â€™ as he added, â€˜is weel rendered into English metre by my friend
Bangour:--

    Ae half the prayer wiâ€™ Phoebus grace did find,
    The tâ€™other half he whistled down the wind.â€™





CHAPTER XV

THE MARCH


The conflicting passions and exhausted feelings of Waverley had resigned
him to late but sound repose. He was dreaming of Glennaquoich, and had
transferred to the halls of Ian nan Chaistel the festal train which so
lately graced those of Holyrood. The pibroch too was distinctly heard;
and this at least was no delusion, for the â€˜proud step of the chief
piperâ€™ of the â€˜chlain Mac-Ivorâ€™ was perambulating the court before the
door of his Chieftainâ€™s quarters, and as Mrs. Flockhart, apparently no
friend to his minstrelsy, was pleased to observe, â€˜garring the very
stane-and-lime waâ€™s dingle wiâ€™ his screeching.â€™ Of course it soon became
too powerful for Waverleyâ€™s dream, with which it had at first rather
harmonised.

The sound of Callumâ€™s brogues in his apartment (for Mac-Ivor had again
assigned Waverley to his care) was the next note of parting. â€˜Winna yer
honour bang up? Vich Ian Vohr and ta Prince are awa to the lang green
glen ahint the clachan, tat they caâ€™ the Kingâ€™s Park, [Footnote: The main
body of the Highland army encamped, or rather bivouacked, in that part of
the Kingâ€™s Park which lies towards the village of Duddingston.] and mony
aneâ€™s on his ain shanks the day that will be carried on ither folkâ€™s ere
night.â€™

Waverley sprung up, and, with Callumâ€™s assistance and instructions,
adjusted his tartans in proper costume. Callum told him also,â€™ tat his
leather dorlach wiâ€™ the lock on her was come frae Doune, and she was awa
again in the wain wiâ€™ Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s walise.â€™

By this periphrasis Waverley readily apprehended his portmanteau was
intended. He thought upon the mysterious packet of the maid of the
cavern, which seemed always to escape him when within his very grasp. But
this was no time for indulgence of curiosity; and having declined Mrs.
Flockhartâ€™s compliment of a MORNING, i.e. a matutinal dram, being
probably the only man in the Chevalierâ€™s army by whom such a courtesy
would have been rejected, he made his adieus and departed with Callum.

â€˜Callum,â€™ said he, as they proceeded down a dirty close to gain the
southern skirts of the Canongate, â€˜what shall I do for a horse?â€™

â€˜Ta deil ane ye maun think oâ€™,â€™ said Callum. â€˜Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s marching on
foot at the head oâ€™ his kin (not to say ta Prince, wha does the like),
wiâ€™ his target on his shoulder; and ye maun eâ€™en be neighbour-like.â€™

â€˜And so I will, Callum, give me my target; so, there we are fixed. How
does it look?â€™

â€˜Like the braâ€™ Highlander tatâ€™s painted on the board afore the mickle
change-house they caâ€™ Luckie Middlemassâ€™s,â€™ answered Callum; meaning, I
must observe, a high compliment, for in his opinion Luckie Middlemassâ€™s
sign was an exquisite specimen of art. Waverley, however, not feeling the
full force of this polite simile, asked him no further questions.

Upon extricating themselves from the mean and dirty suburbs of the
metropolis, and emerging into the open air, Waverley felt a renewal of
both health and spirits, and turned his recollection with firmness upon
the events of the preceding evening, and with hope and resolution towards
those of the approaching day.

When he had surmounted a small craggy eminence called St. Leonardâ€™s Hill,
the Kingâ€™s Park, or the hollow between the mountain of Arthurâ€™s Seat and
the rising grounds on which the southern part of Edinburgh is now built,
lay beneath him, and displayed a singular and animating prospect. It was
occupied by the army of the Highlanders, now in the act of preparing for
their march. Waverley had already seen something of the kind at the
hunting-match which he attended with Fergus Mac-Ivor; but this was on a
scale of much greater magnitude, and incomparably deeper interest. The
rocks, which formed the background of the scene, and the very sky itself,
rang with the clang of the bagpipers, summoning forth, each with his
appropriate pibroch, his chieftain and clan. The mountaineers, rousing
themselves from their couch under the canopy of heaven with the hum and
bustle of a confused and irregular multitude, like bees alarmed and
arming in their hives, seemed to possess all the pliability of movement
fitted to execute military manoeuvres. Their motions appeared spontaneous
and confused, but the result was order and regularity; so that a general
must have praised the conclusion, though a martinet might have ridiculed
the method by which it was attained.

The sort of complicated medley created by the hasty arrangements of the
various clans under their respective banners, for the purpose of getting
into the order of march, was in itself a gay and lively spectacle. They
had no tents to strike having generally, and by choice, slept upon the
open field, although the autumn was now waning and the nights began to be
frosty. For a little space, while they were getting into order, there was
exhibited a changing, fluctuating, and confused appearance of waving
tartans and floating plumes, and of banners displaying the proud
gathering word of Clanronald, Ganion Coheriga (Gainsay who dares),
Loch-Sloy, the watchword of the MacFarlanes; Forth, fortune, and fill the
fetters, the motto of the Marquis of Tullibardine; Bydand, that of Lord
Lewis Gordon, and the appropriate signal words and emblems of many other
chieftains and clans.

At length the mixed and wavering multitude arranged themselves into a
narrow and dusky column of great length, stretching through the whole
extent of the valley. In the front of the column the standard of the
Chevalier was displayed, bearing a red cross upon a white ground, with
the motto Tandem Triumphans. The few cavalry, being chiefly Lowland
gentry, with their domestic servants and retainers, formed the advanced
guard of the army; and their standards, of which they had rather too many
in respect of their numbers, were seen waving upon the extreme verge of
the horizon. Many horsemen of this body, among whom Waverley accidentally
remarked Balmawhapple and his lieutenant, Jinker (which last, however,
had been reduced, with several others, by the advice of the Baron of
Bradwardine, to the situation of what he called reformed officers, or
reformadoes), added to the liveliness, though by no means to the
regularity, of the scene, by galloping their horses as fast forward as
the press would permit, to join their proper station in the van. The
fascinations of the Circes of the High Street, and the potations of
strength with which they had been drenched over night, had probably
detained these heroes within the walls of Edinburgh somewhat later than
was consistent with their morning duty. Of such loiterers, the prudent
took the longer and circuitous, but more open, route to attain their
place in the march, by keeping at some distance from the infantry, and
making their way through the inclosures to the right, at the expense of
leaping over or pulling down the drystone fences. The irregular
appearance and vanishing of these small parties of horsemen, as well as
the confusion occasioned by those who endeavoured, though generally
without effect, to press to the front through the crowd of Highlanders,
maugre their curses, oaths, and opposition, added to the picturesque
wildness what it took from the military regularity of the scene.

While Waverley gazed upon this remarkable spectacle, rendered yet more
impressive by the occasional discharge of cannon-shot from the Castle at
the Highland guards as they were withdrawn from its vicinity to join
their main body, Callum, with his usual freedom of interference, reminded
him that Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s folk were nearly at the head of the column of
march which was still distant, and that â€˜they would gang very fast after
the cannon fired.â€™ Thus admonished, Waverley walked briskly forward, yet
often casting a glance upon the darksome clouds of warriors who were
collected before and beneath him. A nearer view, indeed, rather
diminished the effect impressed on the mind by the more distant
appearance of the army. The leading men of each clan were well armed with
broad-sword, target, and fusee, to which all added the dirk, and most the
steel pistol. But these consisted of gentlemen, that is, relations of the
chief, however distant, and who had an immediate title to his countenance
and protection. Finer and hardier men could not have been selected out of
any army in Christendom; while the free and independent habits which each
possessed, and which each was yet so well taught to subject to the
command of his chief, and the peculiar mode of discipline adopted in
Highland warfare, rendered them equally formidable by their individual
courage and high spirit, and from their rational conviction of the
necessity of acting in unison, and of giving their national mode of
attack the fullest opportunity of success.

But, in a lower rank to these, there were found individuals of an
inferior description, the common peasantry of the Highland country, who,
although they did not allow themselves to be so called, and claimed
often, with apparent truth, to be of more ancient descent than the
masters whom they served, bore, nevertheless, the livery of extreme
penury, being indifferently accoutred, and worse armed, half naked,
stinted in growth, and miserable in aspect. Each important clan had some
of those Helots attached to them: thus, the MacCouls, though tracing
their descent from Comhal, the father of Finn or Fingal, were a sort of
Gibeonites, or hereditary servants to the Stewarts of Appin; the
Macbeths, descended from the unhappy monarch of that name, were subjects
to the Morays and clan Donnochy, or Robertsons of Athole; and many other
examples might be given, were it not for the risk of hurting any pride of
clanship which may yet be left, and thereby drawing a Highland tempest
into the shop of my publisher. Now these same Helots, though forced into
the field by the arbitrary authority of the chieftains under whom they
hewed wood and drew water, were in general very sparingly fed, ill
dressed, and worse armed. The latter circumstance was indeed owing
chiefly to the general disarming act, which had been carried into effect
ostensibly through the whole Highlands, although most of the chieftains
contrived to elude its influence by retaining the weapons of their own
immediate clansmen, and delivering up those of less value, which they
collected from these inferior satellites. It followed, as a matter of
course, that, as we have already hinted, many of these poor fellows were
brought to the field in a very wretched condition.

From this it happened that, in bodies, the van of which were admirably
well armed in their own fashion, the rear resembled actual banditti. Here
was a pole-axe, there a sword without a scabbard; here a gun without a
lock, there a scythe set straight upon a pole; and some had only their
dirks, and bludgeons or stakes pulled out of hedges. The grim, uncombed,
and wild appearance of these men, most of whom gazed with all the
admiration of ignorance upon the most ordinary productions of domestic
art, created surprise in the Lowlands, but it also created terror. So
little was the condition of the Highlands known at that late period that
the character and appearance of their population, while thus sallying
forth as military adventurers, conveyed to the South-Country Lowlanders
as much surprise as if an invasion of African Negroes or Esquimaux
Indians had issued forth from the northern mountains of their own native
country. It cannot therefore be wondered if Waverley, who had hitherto
judged of the Highlanders generally from the samples which the policy of
Fergus had from time to time exhibited, should have felt damped and
astonished at the daring attempt of a body not then exceeding four
thousand men, and of whom not above half the number, at the utmost, were
armed, to change the fate and alter the dynasty of the British kingdoms.

As he moved along the column, which still remained stationary, an iron
gun, the only piece of artillery possessed by the army which meditated so
important a revolution, was fired as the signal of march. The Chevalier
had expressed a wish to leave this useless piece of ordnance behind him;
but, to his surprise, the Highland chiefs interposed to solicit that it
might accompany their march, pleading the prejudices of their followers,
who, little accustomed to artillery, attached a degree of absurd
importance to this field-piece, and expected it would contribute
essentially to a victory which they could only owe to their own muskets
and broadswords. Two or three French artillerymen were therefore
appointed to the management of this military engine, which was drawn
along by a string of Highland ponies, and was, after all, only used for
the purpose of firing signals. [Footnote: See Note 31.]

No sooner was its voice heard upon the present occasion than the whole
line was in motion. A wild cry of joy from the advancing batallions rent
the air, and was then lost in the shrill clangour of the bagpipes, as the
sound of these, in their turn, was partially drowned by the heavy tread
of so many men put at once into motion. The banners glittered and shook
as they moved forward, and the horse hastened to occupy their station as
the advanced guard, and to push on reconnoitring parties to ascertain and
report the motions of the enemy. They vanished from Waverleyâ€™s eye as
they wheeled round the base of Arthurâ€™s Seat, under the remarkable ridge
of basaltic rocks which fronts the little lake of Duddingston.

The infantry followed in the same direction, regulating their pace by
another body which occupied a road more to the southward. It cost Edward
some exertion of activity to attain the place which Fergusâ€™s followers
occupied in the line of march.




CHAPTER XVI

AN INCIDENT GIVES RISE TO UNAVAILING REFLECTIONS


When Waverley reached that part of the column which was filled by the
clan of Mac-Ivor, they halted, formed, and received him with a triumphant
flourish upon the bagpipes and a loud shout of the men, most of whom knew
him personally, and were delighted to see him in the dress of their
country and of their sept. â€˜You shout,â€™ said a Highlander of a
neighbouring clan to Evan Dhu, â€˜as if the Chieftain were just come to
your head.â€™

â€˜Mar e Bran is e a brathair, If it be not Bran, it is Branâ€™s brother,â€™
was the proverbial reply of Maccombich. [Footnote: Bran, the well-known
dog of Fingal, is often the theme of Highland proverb as well as song.]

â€˜O, then, it is the handsome Sassenach duinhe-wassel that is to be
married to Lady Flora?â€™

â€˜That may be, or it may not be; and it is neither your matter nor mine,
Gregor.â€™

Fergus advanced to embrace the volunteer, and afford him a warm and
hearty welcome; but he thought it necessary to apologize for the
diminished numbers of his battalion (which did not exceed three hundred
men) by observing he had sent a good many out upon parties.

The real fact, however, was, that the defection of Donald Bean Lean had
deprived him of at least thirty hardy fellows, whose services he had
fully reckoned upon, and that many of his occasional adherents had been
recalled by their several chiefs to the standards to which they most
properly owed their allegiance. The rival chief of the great northern
branch, also, of his own clan had mustered his people, although he had
not yet declared either for the government or for the Chevalier, and by
his intrigues had in some degree diminished the force with which Fergus
took the field. To make amends for these disappointments, it was
universally admitted that the followers of Vich Ian Vohr, in point of
appearance, equipment, arms, and dexterity in using them, equalled the
most choice troops which followed the standard of Charles Edward. Old
Ballenkeiroch acted as his major; and, with the other officers who had
known Waverley when at Glennaquoich, gave our hero a cordial reception,
as the sharer of their future dangers and expected honours.

The route pursued by the Highland army, after leaving the village of
Duddingston, was for some time the common post-road betwixt Edinburgh and
Haddington, until they crossed the Esk at Musselburgh, when, instead of
keeping the low grounds towards the sea, they turned more inland, and
occupied the brow of the eminence called Carberry Hill, a place already
distinguished in Scottish history as the spot where the lovely Mary
surrendered herself to her insurgent subjects. This direction was chosen
because the Chevalier had received notice that the army of the
government, arriving by sea from Aberdeen, had landed at Dunbar, and
quartered the night before to the west of Haddington, with the intention
of falling down towards the sea-side, and approaching Edinburgh by the
lower coast-road. By keeping the height, which overhung that road in many
places, it was hoped the Highlanders might find an opportunity of
attacking them to advantage. The army therefore halted upon the ridge of
Carberry Hill, both to refresh the soldiers and as a central situation
from which their march could be directed to any point that the motions of
the enemy might render most advisable. While they remained in this
position a messenger arrived in haste to desire Mac-Ivor to come to the
Prince, adding that their advanced post had had a skirmish with some of
the enemyâ€™s cavalry, and that the Baron of Bradwardine had sent in a few
prisoners.

Waverley walked forward out of the line to satisfy his curiosity, and
soon observed five or six of the troopers who, covered with dust, had
galloped in to announce that the enemy were in full march westward along
the coast. Passing still a little farther on, he was struck with a groan
which issued from a hovel. He approached the spot, and heard a voice, in
the provincial English of his native county, which endeavoured, though
frequently interrupted by pain, to repeat the Lordâ€™s Prayer. The voice of
distress always found a ready answer in our heroâ€™s bosom. He entered the
hovel, which seemed to be intended for what is called, in the pastoral
counties of Scotland, a smearing-house; and in its obscurity Edward could
only at first discern a sort of red bundle; for those who had stripped
the wounded man of his arms and part of his clothes had left him the
dragoon-cloak in which he was enveloped.

â€˜For the love of God,â€™ said the wounded man, as he heard Waverleyâ€™s step,
â€˜give me a single drop of water!â€™

â€˜You shall have it,â€™ answered Waverley, at the same time raising him in
his arms, bearing him to the door of the hut, and giving him some drink
from his flask.

â€˜I should know that voice,â€™ said the man; but looking on Waverleyâ€™s dress
with a bewildered look--â€˜no, this is not the young squire!â€™

This was the common phrase by which Edward was distinguished on the
estate of Waverley-Honour, and the sound now thrilled to his heart with
the thousand recollections which the well-known accents of his native
country had already contributed to awaken. â€˜Houghton!â€™ he said, gazing on
the ghastly features which death was fast disfiguring, â€˜can this be you?â€™

â€˜I never thought to hear an English voice again,â€™ said the wounded
man; â€˜they left me to live or die here as I could, when they found I would
say nothing about the strength of the regiment. But, O squire! how could
you stay from us so long, and let us be tempted by that fiend of the pit,
Ruffin? we should have followed you through flood and fire, to be sure.â€™

â€˜Ruffin! I assure you, Houghton, you have been vilely imposed upon.â€™

â€˜I often thought so,â€™ said Houghton, â€˜though they showed us your very
seal; and so Tims was shot and I was reduced to the ranks.â€™

â€˜Do not exhaust your strength in speaking,â€™ said Edward; â€˜I will get you
a surgeon presently.â€™

He saw Mac-Ivor approaching, who was now returning from headquarters,
where he had attended a council of war, and hastened to meet him. â€˜Brave
news!â€™ shouted the Chief; â€˜we shall be at it in less than two hours. The
Prince has put himself at the head of the advance, and, as he drew his
sword, called out, â€œMy friends, I have thrown away the scabbard.â€ Come,
Waverley, we move instantly.â€™

â€˜A moment--a moment; this poor prisoner is dying; where shall I find a
surgeon?â€™

â€˜Why, where should you? We have none, you know, but two or three French
fellows, who, I believe, are little better than _garcons apothecaires_.â€™

â€˜But the man will bleed to death.â€™

â€˜Poor fellow!â€™ said Fergus, in a momentary fit of compassion; then
instantly added, â€˜But it will be a thousand menâ€™s fate before night; so
come along.â€™

â€˜I cannot; I tell you he is a son of a tenant of my uncleâ€™s.â€™

â€˜O, if heâ€™s a follower of yours he must be looked to; Iâ€™ll send Callum to
you; but _diaoul! ceade millia mottigheart_,â€™ continued the impatient
Chieftain, â€˜what made an old soldier like Bradwardine send dying men here
to cumber us?â€™

Callum came with his usual alertness; and, indeed, Waverley rather gained
than lost in the opinion of the Highlanders by his anxiety about the
wounded man. They would not have understood the general philanthropy
which rendered it almost impossible for Waverley to have passed any
person in such distress; but, as apprehending that the sufferer was one
of his _following_ they unanimously allowed that Waverleyâ€™s conduct was
that of a kind and considerate chieftain, who merited the attachment of his
people. In about a quarter of an hour poor Humphrey breathed his last,
praying his young master, when he returned to Waverley-Honour, to be kind
to old Job Houghton and his dame, and conjuring him not to fight with
these wild petticoat-men against old England.

When his last breath was drawn, Waverley, who had beheld with sincere
sorrow, and no slight tinge of remorse, the final agonies of mortality,
now witnessed for the first time, commanded Callum to remove the body
into the hut. This the young Highlander performed, not without examining
the pockets of the defunct, which, however, he remarked had been pretty
well spunged. He took the cloak, however, and proceeding with the
provident caution of a spaniel hiding a bone, concealed it among some
furze and carefully marked the spot, observing that, if he chanced to
return that way, it would be an excellent rokelay for his auld mother
Elspat.

It was by a considerable exertion that they regained their place in the
marching column, which was now moving rapidly forward to occupy the high
grounds above the village of Tranent, between which and the sea lay the
purposed march of the opposite army.

This melancholy interview with his late sergeant forced many unavailing
and painful reflections upon Waverleyâ€™s mind. It was clear from the
confession of the man that Colonel Gardinerâ€™s proceedings had been
strictly warranted, and even rendered indispensable, by the steps taken
in Edwardâ€™s name to induce the soldiers of his troop to mutiny. The
circumstance of the seal he now, for the first time, recollected, and
that he had lost it in the cavern of the robber, Bean Lean. That the
artful villain had secured it, and used it as the means of carrying on an
intrigue in the regiment for his own purposes, was sufficiently evident;
and Edward had now little doubt that in the packet placed in his
portmanteau by his daughter he should find farther light upon his
proceedings. In the meanwhile the repeated expostulation of
Houghton--â€˜Ah, squire, why did you leave us?â€™ rung like a knell in his
ears.

â€˜Yes,â€™ he said, â€˜I have indeed acted towards you with thoughtless
cruelty. I brought you from your paternal fields, and the protection of a
generous and kind landlord, and when I had subjected you to all the
rigour of military discipline, I shunned to bear my own share of the
burden, and wandered from the duties I had undertaken, leaving alike
those whom it was my business to protect, and my own reputation, to
suffer under the artifices of villainy. O, indolence and indecision of
mind, if not in yourselves vices--to how much exquisite misery and
mischief do you frequently prepare the way!â€™




CHAPTER XVII

THE EVE OF BATTLE


Although the Highlanders marched on very fast, the sun was declining when
they arrived upon the brow of those high grounds which command an open
and extensive plain stretching northward to the sea, on which are
situated, but at a considerable distance from each other, the small
villages of Seaton and Cockenzie, and the larger one of Preston. One of
the low coastroads to Edinburgh passed through this plain, issuing upon
it from the enclosures of Seaton House, and at the town or village of
Preston again entering the denies of an enclosed country. By this way the
English general had chosen to approach the metropolis, both as most
commodious for his cavalry, and being probably of opinion that by doing
so he would meet in front with the Highlanders advancing from Edinburgh
in the opposite direction. In this he was mistaken; for the sound
judgment of the Chevalier, or of those to whose advice he listened, left
the direct passage free, but occupied the strong ground by which it was
overlooked and commanded.

When the Highlanders reached the heights above the plain described, they
were immediately formed in array of battle along the brow of the hill.
Almost at the same instant the van of the English appeared issuing from
among the trees and enclosures of Seaton, with the purpose of occupying
the level plain between the high ground and the sea; the space which
divided the armies being only about half a mile in breadth. Waverley
could plainly see the squadrons of dragoons issue, one after another,
from the defiles, with their videttes in front, and form upon the plain,
with their front opposed to that of the Princeâ€™s army. They were followed
by a train of field-pieces, which, when they reached the flank of the
dragoons, were also brought into line and pointed against the heights.
The march was continued by three or four regiments of infantry marching
in open column, their fixed bayonets showing like successive hedges of
steel, and their arms glancing like lightning, as, at a signal given,
they also at once wheeled up, and were placed in direct opposition to the
Highlanders. A second train of artillery, with another regiment of horse,
closed the long march, and formed on the left flank of the infantry, the
whole line facing southward.

While the English army went through these evolutions, the Highlanders
showed equal promptitude and zeal for battle. As fast as the clans came
upon the ridge which fronted their enemy, they were formed into line, so
that both armies got into complete order of battle at the same moment.
When this was accomplished, the Highlanders set up a tremendous yell,
which was re-echoed by the heights behind them. The regulars, who were in
high spirits, returned a loud shout of defiance, and fired one or two of
their cannon upon an advanced post of the Highlanders. The latter
displayed great earnestness to proceed instantly to the attack, Evan Dhu
urging to Fergus, by way of argument, that â€˜the SIDIER ROY was tottering
like an egg upon a staff, and that they had aâ€™ the vantage of the onset,
for even a haggis (God bless her!) could charge down hill.â€™

But the ground through which the mountaineers must have descended,
although not of great extent, was impracticable in its character, being
not only marshy but intersected with walls of dry stone, and traversed in
its whole length by a very broad and deep ditch, circumstances which must
have given the musketry of the regulars dreadful advantages before the
mountaineers could have used their swords, on which they were taught to
rely. The authority of the commanders was therefore interposed to curb
the impetuosity of the Highlanders, and only a few marksmen were sent
down the descent to skirmish with the enemyâ€™s advanced posts and to
reconnoitre the ground.

Here, then, was a military spectacle of no ordinary interest or usual
occurrence. The two armies, so different in aspect and discipline, yet
each admirably trained in its own peculiar mode of war, upon whose
conflict the temporary fate at least of Scotland appeared to depend, now
faced each other like two gladiators in the arena, each meditating upon
the mode of attacking their enemy. The leading officers and the generalâ€™s
staff of each army could be distinguished in front of their lines, busied
with spy-glasses to watch each otherâ€™s motions, and occupied in
despatching the orders and receiving the intelligence conveyed by the
aides-de-camp and orderly men, who gave life to the scene by galloping
along in different directions, as if the fate of the day depended upon
the speed of their horses. The space between the armies was at times
occupied by the partial and irregular contest of individual
sharp-shooters, and a hat or bonnet was occasionally seen to fall, as a
wounded man was borne off by his comrades. These, however, were but
trifling skirmishes, for it suited the views of neither party to advance
in that direction. From the neighbouring hamlets the peasantry cautiously
showed themselves, as if watching the issue of the expected engagement;
and at no great distance in the bay were two square-rigged vessels,
bearing the English flag, whose tops and yards were crowded with less
timid spectators.

When this awful pause had lasted for a short time, Fergus, with another
chieftain, received orders to detach their clans towards the village of
Preston, in order to threaten the right flank of Copeâ€™s army and compel
him to a change of position. To enable him to execute these orders, the
Chief of Glennaquoich occupied the church-yard of Tranent, a commanding
situation, and a convenient place, as Evan Dhu remarked, â€˜for any
gentleman who might have the misfortune to be killed, and chanced to be
curious about Christian burial.â€™ To check or dislodge this party, the
English general detached two guns, escorted by a strong party of cavalry.
They approached so near that Waverley could plainly recognise the
standard of the troop he had formerly commanded, and hear the trumpets
and kettle-drums sound the signal of advance which he had so often
obeyed. He could hear, too, the well-known word given in the English
dialect by the equally well-distinguished voice of the commanding
officer, for whom he had once felt so much respect. It was at that
instant, that, looking around him, he saw the wild dress and appearance
of his Highland associates, heard their whispers in an uncouth and
unknown language, looked upon his own dress, so unlike that which he had
worn from his infancy, and wished to awake from what seemed at the moment
a dream, strange, horrible, and unnatural. â€˜Good God!â€™ he muttered, â€˜am I
then a traitor to my country, a renegade to my standard, and a foe, as
that poor dying wretch expressed himself, to my native England!â€™

Ere he could digest or smother the recollection, the tall military form
of his late commander came full in view, for the purpose of
reconnoitring. â€˜I can hit him now,â€™ said Callum, cautiously raising his
fusee over the wall under which he lay couched, at scarce sixty yardsâ€™
distance.

Edward felt as if he was about to see a parricide committed in his
presence; for the venerable grey hair and striking countenance of the
veteran recalled the almost paternal respect with which his officers
universally regarded him. But ere he could say â€˜Hold!â€™ an aged Highlander
who lay beside Callum Beg stopped his arm. â€˜Spare your shot,â€™ said the
seer, â€˜his hour is not yet come. But let him beware of to-morrow; I see
his winding-sheet high upon his breast.â€™

Callum, flint to other considerations, was penetrable to superstition. He
turned pale at the words of the _taishatr_, and recovered his piece.
Colonel Gardiner, unconscious of the danger he had escaped, turned his
horse round and rode slowly back to the front of his regiment.

By this time the regular army had assumed a new line, with one flank
inclined towards the sea and the other resting upon the village of
Preston; and, as similar difficulties occurred in attacking their new
position, Fergus and the rest of the detachment were recalled to their
former post. This alteration created the necessity of a corresponding
change in General Copeâ€™s army, which was again brought into a line
parallel with that of the Highlanders. In these manoeuvres on both sides
the daylight was nearly consumed, and both armies prepared to rest upon
their arms for the night in the lines which they respectively occupied.

â€˜There will be nothing done to-night,â€™ said Fergus to his friend
Waverley; â€˜ere we wrap ourselves in our plaids, let us go see what the
Baron is doing in the rear of the line.â€™

When they approached his post, they found the good old careful officer,
after having sent out his night patrols and posted his sentinels, engaged
in reading the Evening Service of the Episcopal Church to the remainder
of his troop. His voice was loud and sonorous, and though his spectacles
upon his nose, and the appearance of Saunders Saunderson, in military
array, performing the functions of clerk, had something ludicrous, yet
the circumstances of danger in which they stood, the military costume of
the audience, and the appearance of their horses saddled and picqueted
behind them, gave an impressive and solemn effect to the office of
devotion.

â€˜I have confessed to-day, ere you were awake,â€™ whispered Fergus to
Waverley; â€˜yet I am not so strict a Catholic as to refuse to join in this
good manâ€™s prayers.â€™

Edward assented, and they remained till the Baron had concluded the
service.

As he shut the book, â€˜Now, lads,â€™ said he, â€˜have at them in the morning
with heavy hands and light consciences.â€™ He then kindly greeted Mac-Ivor
and Waverley, who requested to know his opinion of their situation. Why,
you know Tacitus saith, â€œIn rebus bellicis maxime dominalur Fortuna,â€
 which is equiponderate with our vernacular adage, â€œLuck can maist in the
mellee.â€ But credit me, gentlemen, yon man is not a deacon oâ€™ his craft.
He damps the spirits of the poor lads he commands by keeping them on the
defensive, whilk of itself implies inferiority or fear. Now will they lie
on their arms yonder as anxious and as ill at ease as a toad under a
harrow, while our men will be quite fresh and blithe for action in the
morning. Well, good-night. One thing troubles me, but if to-morrow goes
well off, I will consult you about it, Glennaquoich.â€™

â€˜I could almost apply to Mr. Bradwardine the character which Henry gives
of Fluellen,â€™ said Waverley, as his friend and he walked towards their
bivouac:

    â€˜Though it appears a little out of fashion,
    There is much care and valour in this â€œScotchman.â€â€™

â€˜He has seen much service,â€™ answered Fergus, â€˜and one is sometimes
astonished to find how much nonsense and reason are mingled in his
composition. I wonder what can be troubling his mind; probably something
about Rose. Hark! the English are setting their watch.â€™

The roll of the drum and shrill accompaniment of the fifes swelled up the
hill--died away--resumed its thunder--and was at length hushed. The
trumpets and kettle-drums of the cavalry were next heard to perform the
beautiful and wild point of war appropriated as a signal for that piece
of nocturnal duty, and then finally sunk upon the wind with a shrill and
mournful cadence.

The friends, who had now reached their post, stood and looked round them
ere they lay down to rest. The western sky twinkled with stars, but a
frost-mist, rising from the ocean, covered the eastern horizon, and
rolled in white wreaths along the plain where the adverse army lay
couched upon their arms. Their advanced posts were pushed as far as the
side of the great ditch at the bottom of the descent, and had kindled
large fires at different intervals, gleaming with obscure and hazy lustre
through the heavy fog which encircled them with a doubtful halo.

The Highlanders, â€˜thick as leaves in Vallombrosa,â€™ lay stretched upon the
ridge of the hill, buried (excepting their sentinels) in the most
profound repose. â€˜How many of these brave fellows will sleep more soundly
before to-morrow night, Fergus!â€™ said Waverley, with an involuntary sigh.

â€˜You must not think of that,â€™ answered Fergus, whose ideas were entirely
military. â€˜You must only think of your sword, and by whom it was given.
All other reflections are now TOO LATE.â€™

With the opiate contained in this undeniable remark Edward endeavoured to
lull the tumult of his conflicting feelings. The Chieftain and he,
combining their plaids, made a comfortable and warm couch. Callum,
sitting down at their head (for it was his duty to watch upon the
immediate person of the Chief), began a long mournful song in Gaelic, to
a low and uniform tune, which, like the sound of the wind at a distance,
soon lulled them to sleep.




CHAPTER XVIII

THE CONFLICT


When Fergus Mac-Ivor and his friend had slept for a few hours, they were
awakened and summoned to attend the Prince. The distant village clock was
heard to toll three as they hastened to the place where he lay. He was
already surrounded by his principal officers and the chiefs of clans. A
bundle of pease-straw, which had been lately his couch, now served for
his seat. Just as Fergus reached the circle, the consultation had broken
up. â€˜Courage, my brave friends!â€™ said the Chevalier, â€˜and each one put
himself instantly at the head of his command; a faithful friend
[Footnote: See Note 32.] has offered to guide us by a practicable, though
narrow and circuitous, route, which, sweeping to our right, traverses the
broken ground and morass, and enables us to gain the firm and open plain
upon which the enemy are lying. This difficulty surmounted, Heaven and
your good swords must do the rest.â€™

The proposal spread unanimous joy, and each leader hastened to get his
men into order with as little noise as possible. The army, moving by its
right from off the ground on which they had rested, soon entered the path
through the morass, conducting their march with astonishing silence and
great rapidity. The mist had not risen to the higher grounds, so that for
some time they had the advantage of star-light. But this was lost as the
stars faded before approaching day, and the head of the marching column,
continuing its descent, plunged as it were into the heavy ocean of fog,
which rolled its white waves over the whole plain, and over the sea by
which it was bounded. Some difficulties were now to be encountered,
inseparable from darkness, a narrow, broken, and marshy path, and the
necessity of preserving union in the march. These, however, were less
inconvenient to Highlanders, from their habits of life, than they would
have been to any other troops, and they continued a steady and swift
movement.

As the clan of Ivor approached the firm ground, following the track of
those who preceded them, the challenge of a patrol was heard through the
mist, though they could not see the dragoon by whom it was made--â€˜Who
goes there?â€™

â€˜Hush!â€™ cried Fergus, â€˜hush! let none answer, as he values his life;
press forwardâ€™; and they continued their march with silence and rapidity.

The patrol fired his carabine upon the body, and the report was instantly
followed by the clang of his horseâ€™s feet as he galloped off. â€˜Hylax in
limine latrat,â€™ said the Baron of Bradwardine, who heard the shot; â€˜that
loon will give the alarm.â€™

The clan of Fergus had now gained the firm plain, which had lately borne
a large crop of corn. But the harvest was gathered in, and the expanse
was unbroken by tree, bush, or interruption of any kind. The rest of the
army were following fast, when they heard the drums of the enemy beat the
general. Surprise, however, had made no part of their plan, so they were
not disconcerted by this intimation that the foe was upon his guard and
prepared to receive them. It only hastened their dispositions for the
combat, which were very simple.

The Highland army, which now occupied the eastern end of the wide plain,
or stubble field, so often referred to, was drawn up in two lines,
extending from the morass towards the sea. The first was destined to
charge the enemy, the second to act as a reserve. The few horse, whom the
Prince headed in person, remained between the two lines. The adventurer
had intimated a resolution to charge in person at the head of his first
line; but his purpose was deprecated by all around him, and he was with
difficulty induced to abandon it.

Both lines were now moving forward, the first prepared for instant
combat. The clans of which it was composed formed each a sort of separate
phalanx, narrow in front, and in depth ten, twelve, or fifteen files,
according to the strength of the following. The best-armed and best-born,
for the words were synonymous, were placed in front of each of these
irregular subdivisions. The others in the rear shouldered forward the
front, and by their pressure added both physical impulse and additional
ardour and confidence to those who were first to encounter the danger.

â€˜Down with your plaid, Waverley,â€™ cried Fergus, throwing off his own;
â€˜weâ€™ll win silks for our tartans before the sun is above the sea.â€™

The clansmen on every side stript their plaids, prepared their arms, and
there was an awful pause of about three minutes, during which the men,
pulling off their bonnets, raised their faces to heaven and uttered a
short prayer; then pulled their bonnets over their brows and began to
move forward, at first slowly. Waverley felt his heart at that moment
throb as it would have burst from his bosom. It was not fear, it was not
ardour: it was a compound of both, a new and deeply energetic impulse
that with its first emotion chilled and astounded, then fevered and
maddened his mind. The sounds around him combined to exalt his
enthusiasm; the pipes played, and the clans rushed forward, each in its
own dark column. As they advanced they mended their pace, and the
muttering sounds of the men to each other began to swell into a wild cry.

At this moment the sun, which was now risen above the horizon, dispelled
the mist. The vapours rose like a curtain, and showed the two armies in
the act of closing. The line of the regulars was formed directly fronting
the attack of the Highlanders; it glittered with the appointments of a
complete army, and was flanked by cavalry and artillery. But the sight
impressed no terror on the assailants.

â€˜Forward, sons of Ivor,â€™ cried their Chief, â€˜or the Camerons will draw
the first blood!â€™ They rushed on with a tremendous yell.

The rest is well known. The horse, who were commanded to charge the
advancing Highlanders in the flank, received an irregular fire from their
fusees as they ran on and, seized with a disgraceful panic, wavered,
halted, disbanded, and galloped from the field. The artillery men,
deserted by the cavalry, fled after discharging their pieces, and the
Highlanders, who dropped their guns when fired and drew their
broadswords, rushed with headlong fury against the infantry.

It was at this moment of confusion and terror that Waverley remarked an
English officer, apparently of high rank, standing, alone and
unsupported, by a fieldpiece, which, after the flight of the men by whom
it was wrought, he had himself levelled and discharged against the clan
of Mac-Ivor, the nearest group of Highlanders within his aim. Struck with
his tall, martial figure, and eager to save him from inevitable
destruction, Waverley outstripped for an instant even the speediest of
the warriors, and, reaching the spot first, called to him to surrender.
The officer replied by a thrust with his sword, which Waverley received
in his target, and in turning it aside the Englishmanâ€™s weapon broke. At
the same time the battle-axe of Dugald Mahony was in the act of
descending upon the officerâ€™s head. Waverley intercepted and prevented
the blow, and the officer, perceiving further resistance unavailing, and
struck with Edwardâ€™s generous anxiety for his safety, resigned the
fragment of his sword, and was committed by Waverley to Dugald, with
strict charge to use him well, and not to pillage his person, promising
him, at the same time, full indemnification for the spoil.

On Edwardâ€™s right the battle for a few minutes raged fierce and thick.
The English infantry, trained in the wars in Flanders, stood their ground
with great courage. But their extended files were pierced and broken in
many places by the close masses of the clans; and in the personal
struggle which ensued the nature of the Highlandersâ€™ weapons, and their
extraordinary fierceness and activity, gave them a decided superiority
over those who had been accustomed to trust much to their array and
discipline, and felt that the one was broken and the other useless.
Waverley, as he cast his eyes towards this scene of smoke and slaughter,
observed Colonel Gardiner, deserted by his own soldiers in spite of all
his attempts to rally them, yet spurring his horse through the field to
take the command of a small body of infantry, who, with their backs
arranged against the wall of his own park (for his house was close by the
field of battle), continued a desperate and unavailing resistance.
Waverley could perceive that he had already received many wounds, his
clothes and saddle being marked with blood. To save this good and brave
man became the instant object of his most anxious exertions. But he could
only witness his fall. Ere Edward could make his way among the
Highlanders, who, furious and eager for spoil, now thronged upon each
other, he saw his former commander brought from his horse by the blow of
a scythe, and beheld him receive, while on the ground, more wounds than
would have let out twenty lives. When Waverley came up, however,
perception had not entirely fled. The dying warrior seemed to recognize
Edward, for he fixed his eye upon him with an upbraiding, yet sorrowful,
look, and appeared to struggle, for utterance. But he felt that death was
dealing closely with him, and resigning his purpose, and folding his
hands as if in devotion, he gave up his soul to his Creator. The look
with which he regarded Waverley in his dying moments did not strike him
so deeply at that crisis of hurry and confusion as when it recurred to
his imagination at the distance of some time. [Footnote: See Note 33.]





Loud shouts of triumph now echoed over the whole field. The battle was
fought and won, and the whole baggage, artillery, and military stores of
the regular army remained in possession of the victors. Never was a
victory more complete. Scarce any escaped from the battle, excepting the
cavalry, who had left it at the very onset, and even these were broken
into different parties and scattered all over the country. So far as our
tale is concerned, we have only to relate the fate of Balmawhapple, who,
mounted on a horse as headstrong and stiff-necked as his rider, pursued
the flight of the dragoons above four miles from the field of battle,
when some dozen of the fugitives took heart of grace, turned round, and
cleaving his skull with their broadswords, satisfied the world that the
unfortunate gentleman had actually brains, the end of his life thus
giving proof of a fact greatly doubted during its progress. His death was
lamented by few. Most of those who knew him agreed in the pithy
observation of Ensign Maccombich, that there â€˜was mair tint (lost) at
Sheriff-Muir.â€™ His friend, Lieutenant Jinker, bent his eloquence only to
exculpate his favourite mare from any share in contributing to the
catastrophe. â€˜He had tauld the laird a thousand times,â€™ he said, â€˜that it
was a burning shame to put a martingale upon the puir thing, when he
would needs ride her wiâ€™ a curb of half a yard lang; and that he could na
but bring himsell (not to say her) to some mischief, by flinging her
down, or otherwise; whereas, if he had had a wee bit rinnin ring on the
snaffle, she wad haâ€™ reinâ€™d as cannily as a cadgerâ€™s pownie.â€™

Such was the elegy of the Laird of Balmawhapple. [Footnote: See Note 34.]




CHAPTER XIX

AN UNEXPECTED EMBARRASSMENT


When the battle was over, and all things coming into order, the Baron of
Bradwardine, returning from the duty of the day, and having disposed
those under his command in their proper stations, sought the Chieftain of
Glennaquoich and his friend Edward Waverley. He found the former busied
in determining disputes among his clansmen about points of precedence and
deeds of valour, besides sundry high and doubtful questions concerning
plunder. The most important of the last respected the property of a gold
watch, which had once belonged to some unfortunate English officer. The
party against whom judgment was awarded consoled himself by observing,
â€˜She (i.e. the watch, which he took for a living animal) died the very
night Vich Ian Vohr gave her to Murdochâ€™; the machine, having, in fact,
stopped for want of winding up.

It was just when this important question was decided that the Baron of
Bradwardine, with a careful and yet important expression of countenance,
joined the two young men. He descended from his reeking charger, the care
of which he recommended to one of his grooms. â€˜I seldom ban, sir,â€™ said
he to the man; â€˜but if you play any of your houndâ€™s-foot tricks, and
leave puir Berwick before heâ€™s sorted, to rin after spuilzie, deil be wiâ€™
me if I do not give your craig a thraw.â€™ He then stroked with great
complacency the animal which had borne him through the fatigues of the
day, and having taken a tender leave of him--â€™ Weel, my good young
friends, a glorious and decisive victory,â€™ said he; â€˜but these loons of
troopers fled ower soon. I should have liked to have shown you the true
points of the pralium equestre, or equestrian combat, whilk their
cowardice has postponed, and which I hold to be the pride and terror of
warfare. Weel--I have fought once more in this old quarrel, though I
admit I could not be so far BEN as you lads, being that it was my point
of duty to keep together our handful of horse. And no cavalier ought in
any wise to begrudge honour that befalls his companions, even though they
are ordered upon thrice his danger, whilk, another time, by the blessing
of God, may be his own case. But, Glennaquoich, and you, Mr. Waverley, I
pray ye to give me your best advice on a matter of mickle weight, and
which deeply affects the honour of the house of Bradwardine. I crave your
pardon, Ensign Maccombich, and yours, Inveraughlin, and yours,
Edderalshendrach, and yours, sir.â€™

The last person he addressed was Ballenkeiroch, who, remembering the
death of his son, loured on him with a look of savage defiance. The
Baron, quick as lightning at taking umbrage, had already bent his brow
when Glennaquoich dragged his major from the spot, and remonstrated with
him, in the authoritative tone of a chieftain, on the madness of reviving
a quarrel in such a moment.

â€˜The ground is cumbered with carcasses,â€™ said the old mountaineer,
turning sullenly away; â€˜ONE MORE would hardly have been kennâ€™d upon it;
and if it wasna for yoursell, Vich Ian Vohr, that one should be
Bradwardineâ€™s or mine.â€™

The Chief soothed while he hurried him away; and then returned to the
Baron. â€˜It is Ballenkeiroch,â€™ he said, in an under and confidential
voice, â€˜father of the young man who fell eight years since in the unlucky
affair at the mains.â€™

â€˜Ah!â€™ said the Baron, instantly relaxing the doubtful sternness of his
features, â€˜I can take mickle frae a man to whom I have unhappily
rendered sic a displeasure as that. Ye were right to apprise me,
Glennaquoich; he may look as black as midnight at Martinmas ere Cosmo
Comyne Bradwardine shall say he does him wrang. Ah! I have nae male
lineage, and I should bear with one I have made childless, though you are
aware the blood-wit was made up to your ain satisfaction by assythment,
and that I have since expedited letters of slains. Weel, as I have said,
I have no male issue, and yet it is needful that I maintain the honour of
my house; and it is on that score I prayed ye for your peculiar and
private attention.â€™

The two young men awaited to hear him, in anxious curiosity.

â€˜I doubt na, lads,â€™ he proceeded, â€˜but your education has been sae seen
to that ye understand the true nature of the feudal tenures?â€™

Fergus, afraid of an endless dissertation, answered, â€˜Intimately, Baron,â€™
and touched Waverley as a signal to express no ignorance.

â€˜And ye are aware, I doubt not, that the holding of the barony of
Bradwardine is of a nature alike honourable and peculiar, being blanch
(which Craig opines ought to be Latinated blancum, or rather francum, a
free holding) pro servitio detrahendi, seu exuendi, caligas regis post
battalliam.â€™ Here Fergus turned his falcon eye upon Edward, with an
almost imperceptible rise of his eyebrow, to which his shoulders
corresponded in the same degree of elevation. â€˜Now, twa points of
dubitation occur to me upon this topic. First, whether this service, or
feudal homage, be at any event due to the person of the Prince, the words
being, per expressum, caligas REGIS, the boots of the king himself; and I
pray your opinion anent that particular before we proceed farther.â€™

â€˜Why, he is Prince Regent,â€™ answered Mac-Ivor, with laudable composure of
countenance; â€˜and in the court of France all the honours are rendered to
the person of the Regent which are due to that of the King. Besides, were
I to pull off either of their boots, I would render that service to the
young Chevalier ten times more willingly than to his father.â€™

â€˜Ay, but I talk not of personal predilections. However, your authority
is of great weight as to the usages of the court of France; and doubtless
the Prince, as alter ego, may have a right to claim the homagium of the
great tenants of the crown, since all faithful subjects are commanded, in
the commission of regency, to respect him as the Kingâ€™s own person. Far,
therefore, be it from me to diminish the lustre of his authority by
withholding this act of homage, so peculiarly calculated to give it
splendour; for I question if the Emperor of Germany hath his boots taken
off by a free baron of the empire. But here lieth the second
difficulty--the Prince wears no boots, but simply brogues and trews.â€™

This last dilemma had almost disturbed Fergusâ€™s gravity.

â€˜Why,â€™ said he, â€˜you know, Baron, the proverb tells us, â€œItâ€™s ill taking
the breeks off a Highlandman,â€ and the boots are here in the same
predicament.â€™

â€˜The word caligae, however,â€™ continued the Baron, â€˜though I admit that,
by family tradition, and even in our ancient evidents, it is explained
â€œlie-boots,â€ means, in its primitive sense, rather sandals; and Caius
Caesar, the nephew and successor of Caius Tiberius, received the agnomen
of Caligula, a caligulis sine caligis levioribus, quibus adolescentior
usus fuerat in exercitu Germanici patris sui. And the caligae were also
proper to the monastic bodies; for we read in an ancient glossarium upon
the rule of Saint Benedict, in the Abbey of Saint Amand, that caligae
were tied with latchets.â€™

â€˜That will apply to the brogues,â€™ said Fergus.

â€˜It will so, my dear Glennaquoich, and the words are express: Caligae,
dicta sunt quia ligantur; nam socci non ligantur, sed tantum
intromittuntur; that is, caligae are denominated from the ligatures
wherewith they are bound; whereas socci, which may be analogous to our
mules, whilk the English denominate slippers, are only slipped upon the
feet. The words of the charter are also alternative, exuere seu
detrahere; that is, to undo, as in the case of sandals or brogues, and to
pull of, as we say vernacularly concerning boots. Yet I would we had more
light; but I fear there is little chance of finding hereabout any erudite
author de re vestiaria.â€™

â€˜I should doubt it very much,â€™ said the Chieftain, looking around on the
straggling Highlanders, who were returning loaded with spoils of the
slain, â€˜though the res vestiaria itself seems to be in some request at
present.â€™

This remark coming within the Baronâ€™s idea of jocularity, he honoured it
with a smile, but immediately resumed what to him appeared very serious
business.

â€˜Bailie Macwheeble indeed holds an opinion that this honorary service is
due, from its very nature, si petatur tantum; only if his Royal Highness
shall require of the great tenant of the crown to perform that personal
duty; and indeed he pointed out the case in Dirletonâ€™s Doubts and
Queries, Grippit versus Spicer, anent the eviction of an estate ob non
solutum canonem; that is, for non-payment of a feu-duty of three
pepper-corns a year, whilk were taxt to be worth seven-eighths of a penny
Scots, in whilk the defender was assoilzied. But I deem it safest, wiâ€™
your good favour, to place myself in the way of rendering the Prince this
service, and to proffer performance thereof; and I shall cause the Bailie
to attend with a schedule of a protest, whilk he has here prepared
(taking out a paper), intimating, that if it shall be his Royal
Highnessâ€™s pleasure to accept of other assistance at pulling off his
caligae (whether the same shall be rendered boots or brogues) save that
of the said Baron of Bradwardine, who is in presence ready and willing to
perform the same, it shall in no wise impinge upon or prejudice the right
of the said Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine to perform the said service in
future; nor shall it give any esquire, valet of the chamber, squire, or
page, whose assistance it may please his Royal Highness to employ, any
right, title, or ground for evicting from the said Cosmo Comyne
Bradwardine the estate and barony of Bradwardine, and others held as
aforesaid, by the due and faithful performance thereof.â€™

Fergus highly applauded this arrangement; and the Baron took a friendly
leave of them, with a smile of contented importance upon his visage.

â€˜Long live our dear friend the Baron,â€™ exclaimed the Chief, as soon as he
was out of hearing, â€˜for the most absurd original that exists north of
the Tweed! I wish to heaven I had recommended him to attend the circle
this evening with a boot-ketch under his arm. I think he might have
adopted the suggestion if it had been made with suitable gravity.â€™

â€˜And how can you take pleasure in making a man of his worth so
ridiculous?â€™

â€˜Begging pardon, my dear Waverley, you are as ridiculous as he. Why, do
you not see that the manâ€™s whole mind is wrapped up in this ceremony? He
has heard and thought of it since infancy as the most august privilege
and ceremony in the world; and I doubt not but the expected pleasure of
performing it was a principal motive with him for taking up arms. Depend
upon it, had I endeavoured to divert him from exposing himself he would
have treated me as an ignorant, conceited coxcomb, or perhaps might have
taken a fancy to cut my throat; a pleasure which he once proposed to
himself upon some point of etiquette not half so important, in his eyes,
as this matter of boots or brogues, or whatever the caliga shall finally
be pronounced by the learned. But I must go to headquarters, to prepare
the Prince for this extraordinary scene. My information will be well
taken, for it will give him a hearty laugh at present, and put him on his
guard against laughing when it might be very mal-a-propos. So, au revoir,
my dear Waverley.â€™




CHAPTER VII

THE ENGLISH PRISONER


The first occupation of Waverley, after he departed from the Chieftain,
was to go in quest of the officer whose life he had saved. He was
guarded, along with his companions in misfortune, who were very numerous,
in a gentlemanâ€™s house near the field of battle.

On entering the room where they stood crowded together, Waverley easily
recognised the object of his visit, not only by the peculiar dignity of
his appearance, but by the appendage of Dugald Mahony, with his
battleaxe, who had stuck to him from the moment of his captivity as if he
had been skewered to his side. This close attendance was perhaps for the
purpose of securing his promised reward from Edward, but it also operated
to save the English gentleman from being plundered in the scene of
general confusion; for Dugald sagaciously argued that the amount of the
salvage which he might be allowed would be regulated by the state of the
prisoner when he should deliver him over to Waverley. He hastened to
assure Waverley, therefore, with more words than he usually employed,
that he had â€˜keepit ta sidier roy haill, and that he wasna a plack the
waur since the fery moment when his honour forbad her to gie him a bit
clamhewit wiâ€™ her Lochaber-axe.â€™

Waverley assured Dugald of a liberal recompense, and, approaching the
English officer, expressed his anxiety to do anything which might
contribute to his convenience under his present unpleasant circumstances.

â€˜I am not so inexperienced a soldier, sir,â€™ answered the Englishman, â€˜as
to complain of the fortune of war. I am only grieved to see those scenes
acted in our own island which I have often witnessed elsewhere with
comparative indifference.â€™

â€˜Another such day as this,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜and I trust the cause of your
regrets will be removed, and all will again return to peace and order.â€™

The officer smiled and shook his head. â€˜I must not forget my situation so
far as to attempt a formal confutation of that opinion; but,
notwithstanding your success and the valour which achieved it, you have
undertaken a task to which your strength appears wholly inadequate.â€™

At this moment Fergus pushed into the press.

â€˜Come, Edward, come along; the Prince has gone to Pinkie House for the
night; and we must follow, or lose the whole ceremony of the caligae.
Your friend, the Baron, has been guilty of a great piece of cruelty; he
has insisted upon dragging Bailie Macwheeble out to the field of battle.
Now, you must know, the Bailieâ€™s greatest horror is an armed Highlander
or a loaded gun; and there he stands, listening to the Baronâ€™s
instructions concerning the protest, ducking his head like a sea-gull at
the report of every gun and pistol that our idle boys are firing upon the
fields, and undergoing, by way of penance, at every symptom of flinching
a severe rebuke from his patron, who would not admit the discharge of a
whole battery of cannon, within point-blank distance, as an apology for
neglecting a discourse in which the honour of his family is interested.â€™

â€˜But how has Mr. Bradwardine got him to venture so far?â€™ said Edward.

â€˜Why, he had come as far as Musselburgh, I fancy, in hopes of making some
of our wills; and the peremptory commands of the Baron dragged him
forward to Preston after the battle was over. He complains of one or two
of our ragamuffins having put him in peril of his life by presenting
their pieces at him; but as they limited his ransom to an English penny,
I donâ€™t think we need trouble the provost-marshal upon that subject. So
come along, Waverley.â€™

â€˜Waverley!â€™ said the English officer, with great emotion;â€™ the nephew of
Sir Everard Waverley, of----shire?â€™

â€˜The same, sir,â€™ replied our hero, somewhat surprised at the tone in
which he was addressed.

â€˜I am at once happy and grieved,â€™ said the prisoner, â€˜to have met with
you.â€™

â€˜I am ignorant, sir,â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜how I have deserved so much
interest.â€™

â€˜Did your uncle never mention a friend called Talbot?â€™

â€˜I have heard him talk with great regard of such a person,â€™ replied
Edward; â€˜a colonel, I believe, in the army, and the husband of Lady Emily
Blandeville; but I thought Colonel Talbot had been abroad.â€™

â€˜I am just returned,â€™ answered the officer; â€˜and being in Scotland,
thought it my duty to act where my services promised to be useful. Yes,
Mr. Waverley, I am that Colonel Talbot, the husband of the lady you have
named; and I am proud to acknowledge that I owe alike my professional
rank and my domestic happiness to your generous and noble-minded
relative. Good God! that I should find his nephew in such a dress, and
engaged in such a cause!â€™

â€˜Sir,â€™ said Fergus, haughtily, â€˜the dress and cause are those of men of
birth and honour.â€™

â€˜My situation forbids me to dispute your assertion,â€™ said Colonel Talbot;
â€˜otherwise it were no difficult matter to show that neither courage nor
pride of lineage can gild a bad cause. But, with Mr. Waverleyâ€™s
permission and yours, sir, if yours also must be asked, I would willingly
speak a few words with him on affairs connected with his own family.â€™

â€˜Mr. Waverley, sir, regulates his own motions. You will follow me, I
suppose, to Pinkie,â€™ said Fergus, turning to Edward, â€˜when you have
finished your discourse with this new acquaintance?â€™ So saying, the Chief
of Glennaquoich adjusted his plaid with rather more than his usual air of
haughty assumption and left the apartment.

The interest of Waverley readily procured for Colonel Talbot the freedom
of adjourning to a large garden belonging to his place of confinement.
They walked a few paces in silence, Colonel Talbot apparently studying
how to open what he had to say; at length he addressed Edward.

â€˜Mr. Waverley, you have this day saved my life; and yet I would to God
that I had lost it, ere I had found you wearing the uniform and cockade
of these men.â€™

â€˜I forgive your reproach, Colonel Talbot; it is well meant, and your
education and prejudices render it natural. But there is nothing
extraordinary in finding a man whose honour has been publicly and
unjustly assailed in the situation which promised most fair to afford him
satisfaction on his calumniators.â€™

â€˜I should rather say, in the situation most likely to confirm the reports
which they have circulated,â€™ said Colonel Talbot, â€˜by following the very
line of conduct ascribed to you. Are you aware, Mr. Waverley, of the
infinite distress, and even danger, which your present conduct has
occasioned to your nearest relatives?â€™

â€˜Danger!â€™

â€˜Yes, sir, danger. When I left England your uncle and father had been
obliged to find bail to answer a charge of treason, to which they were
only admitted by the exertion of the most powerful interest. I came down
to Scotland with the sole purpose of rescuing you from the gulf into
which you have precipitated yourself; nor can I estimate the consequences
to your family of your having openly joined the rebellion, since the very
suspicion of your intention was so perilous to them. Most deeply do I
regret that I did not meet you before this last and fatal error.â€™

â€˜I am really ignorant,â€™ said Waverley, in a tone of reserve, â€˜why Colonel
Talbot should have taken so much trouble on my account.â€™

â€˜Mr. Waverley,â€™ answered Talbot, â€˜I am dull at apprehending irony; and
therefore I shall answer your words according to their plain meaning. I
am indebted to your uncle for benefits greater than those which a son
owes to a father. I acknowledge to him the duty of a son; and as I know
there is no manner in which I can requite his kindness so well as by
serving you, I will serve you, if possible, whether you will permit me or
no. The personal obligation which you have this day laid me under
(although, in common estimation, as great as one human being can bestow
on another) adds nothing to my zeal on your behalf; nor can that zeal be
abated by any coolness with which you may please to receive it.â€™

â€˜Your intentions may be kind, sir,â€™ said Waverley, drily; â€˜but your
language is harsh, or at least peremptory.â€™

â€˜On my return to England,â€™ continued Colonel Talbot, â€˜after long absence,
I found your uncle, Sir Everard Waverley, in the custody of a kingâ€™s
messenger, in consequence of the suspicion brought upon him by your
conduct. He is my oldest friend--how often shall I repeat it?--my best
benefactor! he sacrificed his own views of happiness to mine; he never
uttered a word, he never harboured a thought, that benevolence itself
might not have thought or spoken. I found this man in confinement,
rendered harsher to him by his habits of life, his natural dignity of
feeling, and--forgive me, Mr. Waverley--by the cause through which this
calamity had come upon him. I cannot disguise from you my feelings upon
this occasion; they were most painfully unfavorable to you. Having by my
family interest, which you probably know is not inconsiderable, succeeded
in obtaining Sir Everardâ€™s release, I set out for Scotland. I saw Colonel
Gardiner, a man whose fate alone is sufficient to render this
insurrection for ever execrable. In the course of conversation with him I
found that, from late circumstances, from a reexamination of the persons
engaged in the mutiny, and from his original good opinion of your
character, he was much softened towards you; and I doubted not that, if I
could be so fortunate as to discover you, all might yet be well. But this
unnatural rebellion has ruined all. I have, for the first time in a long
and active military life, seen Britons disgrace themselves by a panic
flight, and that before a foe without either arms or discipline. And now
I find the heir of my dearest friend--the son, I may say, of his
affections--sharing a triumph for which he ought the first to have
blushed. Why should I lament Gardiner? his lot was happy compared to
mine!â€™

There was so much dignity in Colonel Talbotâ€™s manner, such a mixture of
military pride and manly sorrow, and the news of Sir Everardâ€™s
imprisonment was told in so deep a tone of feeling, that Edward stood
mortified, abashed, and distressed in presence of the prisoner who owed
to him his life not many hours before. He was not sorry when Fergus
interrupted their conference a second time.

â€˜His Royal Highness commands Mr. Waverleyâ€™s attendance.â€™ Colonel Talbot
threw upon Edward a reproachful glance, which did not escape the quick
eye of the Highland Chief. â€˜His immediate attendance,â€™ he repeated, with
considerable emphasis. Waverley turned again towards the Colonel.

â€˜We shall meet again,â€™ he said; â€˜in the meanwhile, every possible
accommodation--â€™

â€˜I desire none,â€™ said the Colonel; â€˜let me fare like the meanest of those
brave men who, on this day of calamity, have preferred wounds and
captivity to flight; I would almost exchange places with one of those who
have fallen to know that my words have made a suitable impression on your
mind.â€™

â€˜Let Colonel Talbot be carefully secured,â€™ said Fergus to the Highland
officer who commanded the guard over the prisoners; â€˜it is the Princeâ€™s
particular command; he is a prisoner of the utmost importance.â€™

â€˜But let him want no accommodation suitable to his rank,â€™ said Waverley.
â€˜Consistent always with secure custody,â€™ reiterated Fergus. The officer
signified his acquiescence in both commands, and Edward followed Fergus
to the garden-gate, where Callum Beg, with three saddle-horses, awaited
them. Turning his head, he saw Colonel Talbot reconducted to his place of
confinement by a file of Highlanders; he lingered on the threshold of the
door and made a signal with his hand towards Waverley, as if enforcing
the language he had held towards him.

â€˜Horses,â€™ said Fergus, as he mounted, â€˜are now as plenty as blackberries;
every man may have them for the catching. Come, let Callum adjust your
stirrups and let us to Pinkie House [Footnote: Charles Edward took up his
quarters after the battle at Pinkie House, adjoining to Musselburgh.] as
fast as these ci-devant dragoon-horses choose to carry us.â€™




CHAPTER XXI

RATHER UNIMPORTANT


â€˜I was turned back,â€™ said Fergus to Edward, as they galloped from Preston
to Pinkie House, â€˜by a message from the Prince. But I suppose you know
the value of this most noble Colonel Talbot as a prisoner. He is held one
of the best officers among the red-coats, a special friend and favourite
of the Elector himself, and of that dreadful hero, the Duke of
Cumberland, who has been summoned from his triumphs at Fontenoy to come
over and devour us poor Highlanders alive. Has he been telling you how
the bells of St. Jamesâ€™s ring? Not â€œturn again, Whittington,â€ like those
of Bow, in the days of yore?â€™

â€˜Fergus!â€™ said Waverley, with a reproachful look.

â€˜Nay, I cannot tell what to make of you,â€™ answered the Chief of Mac-Ivor,
â€˜you are blown about with every wind of doctrine. Here have we gained a
victory unparalleled in history, and your behaviour is praised by every
living mortal to the skies, and the Prince is eager to thank you in
person, and all our beauties of the White Rose are pulling caps for
you;--and you, the preux chevalier of the day, are stooping on your
horseâ€™s neck like a butter-woman riding to market, and looking as black
as a funeral!â€™

â€˜I am sorry for poor Colonel Gardinerâ€™s death; he was once very kind to
me.â€™

â€˜Why, then, be sorry for five minutes, and then be glad again; his chance
to-day may be ours to-morrow; and what does it signify? The next best
thing to victory is honourable death; but it is a PIS-ALLER, and one
would rather a foe had it than oneâ€™s self.â€™

â€˜But Colonel Talbot has informed me that my father and uncle are both
imprisoned by government on my account.â€™

â€˜Weâ€™ll put in bail, my boy; old Andrew Ferrara [Footnote: See Note 10.]
shall lodge his security; and I should like to see him put to justify it
in Westminster Hall!â€™

â€˜Nay, they are already at liberty, upon bail of a more civic
disposition.â€™

â€˜Then why is thy noble spirit cast down, Edward? Dost think that the
Electorâ€™s ministers are such doves as to set their enemies at liberty at
this critical moment if they could or durst confine and punish them?
Assure thyself that either they have no charge against your relations on
which they can continue their imprisonment, or else they are afraid of
our friends, the jolly Cavaliers of old England. At any rate, you need
not be apprehensive upon their account; and we will find some means of
conveying to them assurances of your safety.â€™

Edward was silenced but not satisfied with these reasons. He had now been
more than once shocked at the small degree of sympathy which Fergus
exhibited for the feelings even of those whom he loved, if they did not
correspond with his own mood at the time, and more especially if they
thwarted him while earnest in a favourite pursuit. Fergus sometimes
indeed observed that he had offended Waverley, but, always intent upon
some favourite plan or project of his own, he was never sufficiently
aware of the extent or duration of his displeasure, so that the
reiteration of these petty offences somewhat cooled the volunteerâ€™s
extreme attachment to his officer.

The Chevalier received Waverley with his usual favour, and paid him many
compliments on his distinguished bravery. He then took him apart, made
many inquiries concerning Colonel Talbot, and when he had received all
the information which Edward was able to give concerning him and his
connexions, he proceeded--â€˜I cannot but think, Mr. Waverley, that since
this gentleman is so particularly connected with our worthy and excellent
friend, Sir Everard Waverley, and since his lady is of the house of
Blandeville, whose devotion to the true and loyal principles of the
Church of England is so generally known, the Colonelâ€™s own private
sentiments cannot be unfavorable to us, whatever mask he may have assumed
to accommodate himself to the times.â€™

â€˜If I am to judge from the language he this day held to me, I am under
the necessity of differing widely from your Royal Highness.â€™

â€˜Well, it is worth making a trial at least. I therefore entrust you with
the charge of Colonel Talbot, with power to act concerning him as you
think most advisable; and I hope you will find means of ascertaining what
are his real dispositions towards our Royal Fatherâ€™s restoration.â€™

â€˜I am convinced,â€™ said Waverley, bowing, â€˜that if Colonel Talbot chooses
to grant his parole, it may be securely depended upon; but if he refuses
it, I trust your Royal Highness will devolve on some other person than
the nephew of his friend the task of laying him under the necessary
restraint.â€™

â€˜I will trust him with no person but you,â€™ said the Prince, smiling, but
peremptorily repeating his mandate; â€˜it is of importance to my service
that there should appear to be a good intelligence between you, even if
you are unable to gain his confidence in earnest. You will therefore
receive him into your quarters, and in case he declines giving his
parole, you must apply for a proper guard. I beg you will go about this
directly. We return to Edinburgh tomorrow.â€™

Being thus remanded to the vicinity of Preston, Waverley lost the Baron
of Bradwardineâ€™s solemn act of homage. So little, however, was he at this
time in love with vanity, that he had quite forgotten the ceremony in
which Fergus had laboured to engage his curiosity. But next day a formal
â€˜Gazetteâ€™ was circulated, containing a detailed account of the battle of
Gladsmuir, as the Highlanders chose to denominate their victory. It
concluded with an account of the court afterwards held by the Chevalier
at Pinkie House, which contained this among other high-flown descriptive
paragraphs:--

â€˜Since that fatal treaty which annihilates Scotland as an independent
nation, it has not been our happiness to see her princes receive, and her
nobles discharge, those acts of feudal homage which, founded upon the
splendid actions of Scottish valour, recall the memory of her early
history, with the manly and chivalrous simplicity of the ties which
united to the Crown the homage of the warriors by whom it was repeatedly
upheld and defended. But on the evening of the 20th our memories were
refreshed with one of those ceremonies which belong to the ancient days
of Scotlandâ€™s glory. After the circle was formed, Cosmo Comyne
Bradwardine of that ilk, colonel in the service, etc., etc., etc., came
before the Prince, attended by Mr. D. Macwheeble, the Bailie of his
ancient barony of Bradwardine (who, we understand, has been lately named
a commissary), and, under form of instrument, claimed permission to
perform to the person of his Royal Highness, as representing his father,
the service used and wont, for which, under a charter of Robert Bruce (of
which the original was produced and inspected by the Masters of his Royal
Highnessâ€™s Chancery for the time being), the claimant held the barony of
Bradwardine and lands of Tully-Veolan. His claim being admitted and
registered, his Royal Highness having placed his foot upon a cushion, the
Baron of Bradwardine, kneeling upon his right knee, proceeded to undo the
latchet of the brogue, or low-heeled Highland shoe, which our gallant
young hero wears in compliment to his brave followers. When this was
performed, his Royal Highness declared the ceremony completed; and,
embracing the gallant veteran, protested that nothing but compliance with
an ordinance of Robert Bruce could have induced him to receive even the
symbolical performance of a menial office from hands which had fought so
bravely to put the crown upon the head of his father. The Baron of
Bradwardine then took instruments in the hands of Mr. Commissary
Macwheeble, bearing that all points and circumstances of the act of
homage had been rite et solenniter acta et peracta; and a corresponding
entry was made in the protocol of the Lord High Chamberlain and in the
record of Chancery. We understand that it is in contemplation of his
Royal Highness, when his Majestyâ€™s pleasure can be known, to raise
Colonel Bradwardine to the peerage, by the title of Viscount Bradwardine
of Bradwardine and Tully-Veolan, and that, in the meanwhile, his Royal
Highness, in his fatherâ€™s name and authority, has been pleased to grant
him an honourable augmentation to his paternal coat of arms, being a
budget or boot-jack, disposed saltier-wise with a naked broadsword, to be
borne in the dexter cantle of the shield; and, as an additional motto, on
a scroll beneath, the words, â€œDraw and draw off.â€â€™

â€˜Were it not for the recollection of Fergusâ€™s raillery,â€™ thought Waverley
to himself, when he had perused this long and grave document, how very
tolerably would all this sound, and how little should I have thought of
connecting it with any ludicrous idea! Well, after all, everything has
its fair as well as its seamy side; and truly I do not see why the
Baronâ€™s boot-jack may not stand as fair in heraldry as the water-buckets,
waggons, cart-wheels, plough-socks, shuttles, candlesticks, and other
ordinaries, conveying ideas of anything save chivalry, which appear in
the arms of some of our most ancient gentry.â€™

This, however, is an episode in respect to the principal story.

When Waverley returned to Preston and rejoined Colonel Talbot, he found
him recovered from the strong and obvious emotions with which a
concurrence of unpleasing events had affected him. He had regained his
natural manner, which was that of an English gentleman and soldier,
manly, open and generous, but not unsusceptible of prejudice against
those of a different country, or who opposed him in political tenets.
When Waverley acquainted Colonel Talbot with the Chevalierâ€™s purpose to
commit him to his charge, â€˜I did not think to have owed so much
obligation to that young gentleman,â€™ he said, â€˜as is implied in this
destination. I can at least cheerfully join in the prayer of the honest
Presbyterian clergyman, that, as he has come among us seeking an earthly
crown, his labours may be speedily rewarded with a heavenly one.
[Footnote: The clergymanâ€™s name was Mac-Vicar. Protected by the cannon of
the Castle, he preached every Sunday in the West Kirk while the
Highlanders were in possession of Edinburgh, and it was in presence of
some of the Jacobites that he prayed for Prince Charles Edward in the
terms quoted in the text.] I shall willingly give my parole not to
attempt an escape without your knowledge, since, in fact, it was to meet
you that I came to Scotland; and I am glad it has happened even under
this predicament. But I suppose we shall be but a short time together.
Your Chevalier (that is a name we may both give to him), with his plaids
and blue caps, will, I presume, be continuing his crusade southward?â€™

â€˜Not as I hear; I believe the army makes some stay in Edinburgh to
collect reinforcements.â€™

â€˜And to besiege the Castle?â€™ said Talbot, smiling sarcastically. â€˜Well,
unless my old commander, General Preston, turn false metal, or the Castle
sink into the North Loch, events which I deem equally probable, I think
we shall have some time to make up our acquaintance. I have a guess that
this gallant Chevalier has a design that I should be your proselyte; and,
as I wish you to be mine, there cannot be a more fair proposal than to
afford us fair conference together. But, as I spoke today under the
influence of feelings I rarely give way to, I hope you will excuse my
entering again upon controversy till we are somewhat better acquainted.â€™




CHAPTER XXII

INTRIGUES OF LOVE AND POLITICS


It is not necessary to record in these pages the triumphant entrance of
the Chevalier into Edinburgh after the decisive affair at Preston. One
circumstance, however, may be noticed, because it illustrates the high
spirit of Flora Mac-Ivor. The Highlanders by whom the Prince was
surrounded, in the license and extravagance of this joyful moment, fired
their pieces repeatedly, and one of these having been accidentally loaded
with ball, the bullet grazed the young ladyâ€™s temple as she waved her
handkerchief from a balcony. [Footnote: See Note 11.] Fergus, who beheld
the accident, was at her side in an instant; and, on seeing that the
wound was trifling, he drew his broadsword with the purpose of rushing
down upon the man by whose carelessness she had incurred so much danger,
when, holding him by the plaid, â€˜Do not harm the poor fellow,â€™ she cried;
â€˜for Heavenâ€™s sake, do not harm him! but thank God with me that the
accident happened to Flora Mac-Ivor; for had it befallen a Whig, they
would have pretended that the shot was fired on purpose.â€™

Waverley escaped the alarm which this accident would have occasioned to
him, as he was unavoidably delayed by the necessity of accompanying
Colonel Talbot to Edinburgh.

They performed the journey together on horseback, and for some time, as
if to sound each otherâ€™s feelings and sentiments, they conversed upon
general and ordinary topics.

When Waverley again entered upon the subject which he had most at heart,
the situation, namely, of his father and his uncle, Colonel Talbot seemed
now rather desirous to alleviate than to aggravate his anxiety. This
appeared particularly to be the case when he heard Waverleyâ€™s history,
which he did not scruple to confide to him.

â€˜And so,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜there has been no malice prepense, as
lawyers, I think, term it, in this rash step of yours; and you have been
trepanned into the service of this Italian knight-errant by a few civil
speeches from him and one or two of his Highland recruiting sergeants? It
is sadly foolish, to be sure, but not nearly so bad as I was led to
expect. However, you cannot desert, even from the Pretender, at the
present moment; that seems impossible. But I have little doubt that, in
the dissensions incident to this heterogeneous mass of wild and desperate
men, some opportunity may arise, by availing yourself of which you may
extricate yourself honourably from your rash engagement before the bubble
burst. If this can be managed, I would have you go to a place of safety
in Flanders which I shall point out. And I think I can secure your pardon
from government after a few monthsâ€™ residence abroad.â€™

â€˜I cannot permit you, Colonel Talbot,â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜to speak of
any plan which turns on my deserting an enterprise in which I may have
engaged hastily, but certainly voluntarily, and with the purpose of
abiding the issue.â€™

â€˜Well,â€™ said Colonel Talbot, smiling, â€˜leave me my thoughts and hopes at
least at liberty, if not my speech. But have you never examined your
mysterious packet?â€™

â€˜It is in my baggage,â€™ replied Edward; â€˜we shall find it in Edinburgh.â€™

In Edinburgh they soon arrived. Waverleyâ€™s quarters had been assigned to
him, by the Princeâ€™s express orders, in a handsome lodging, where there
was accommodation for Colonel Talbot. His first business was to examine
his portmanteau, and, after a very short search, out tumbled the expected
packet. Waverley opened it eagerly. Under a blank cover, simply addressed
to E. Waverley, Esq., he found a number of open letters. The uppermost
were two from Colonel Gardiner addressed to himself. The earliest in date
was a kind and gentle remonstrance for neglect of the writerâ€™s advice
respecting the disposal of his time during his leave of absence, the
renewal of which, he reminded Captain Waverley, would speedily expire.
â€˜Indeed,â€™ the letter proceeded, â€˜had it been otherwise, the news from
abroad and my instructions from the War Office must have compelled me to
recall it, as there is great danger, since the disaster in Flanders, both
of foreign invasion and insurrection among the disaffected at home. I
therefore entreat you will repair as soon as possible to the headquarters
of the regiment; and I am concerned to add that this is still the more
necessary as there is some discontent in your troop, and I postpone
inquiry into particulars until I can have the advantage of your
assistance.â€™

The second letter, dated eight days later, was in such a style as might
have been expected from the Colonelâ€™s receiving no answer to the first.
It reminded Waverley of his duty as a man of honour, an officer, and a
Briton; took notice of the increasing dissatisfaction of his men, and
that some of them had been heard to hint that their Captain encouraged
and approved of their mutinous behaviour; and, finally, the writer
expressed the utmost regret and surprise that he had not obeyed his
commands by repairing to headquarters, reminded him that his leave of
absence had been recalled, and conjured him, in a style in which paternal
remonstrance was mingled with military authority, to redeem his error by
immediately joining his regiment. â€˜That I may be certain,â€™ concluded the
letter, â€˜that this actually reaches you, I despatch it by Corporal Tims
of your troop, with orders to deliver it into your own hand.â€™

Upon reading these letters Waverley, with great bitterness of feeling,
was compelled to make the amende honorable to the memory of the brave and
excellent writer; for surely, as Colonel Gardiner must have had every
reason to conclude they had come safely to hand, less could not follow,
on their being neglected, than that third and final summons, which
Waverley actually received at Glennaquoich, though too late to obey it.
And his being superseded, in consequence of his apparent neglect of this
last command, was so far from being a harsh or severe proceeding, that it
was plainly inevitable. The next letter he unfolded was from the major of
the regiment, acquainting him that a report to the disadvantage of his
reputation was public in the country, stating, that one Mr. Falconer of
Ballihopple, or some such name, had proposed in his presence a
treasonable toast, which he permitted to pass in silence, although it was
so gross an affront to the royal family that a gentleman in company, not
remarkable for his zeal for government, had never-the-less taken the
matter up, and that, supposing the account true, Captain Waverley had
thus suffered another, comparatively unconcerned, to resent an affront
directed against him personally as an officer, and to go out with the
person by whom it was offered. The major concluded that no one of Captain
Waverleyâ€™s brother officers could believe this scandalous story, but that
it was necessarily their joint opinion that his own honour, equally with
that of the regiment, depended upon its being instantly contradicted by
his authority, etc. etc. etc.

â€˜What do you think of all this?â€™ said Colonel Talbot, to whom Waverley
handed the letters after he had perused them.

â€˜Think! it renders thought impossible. It is enough to drive me mad.â€™

â€˜Be calm, my young friend; let us see what are these dirty scrawls that
follow.â€™

The first was addressed,--

â€˜For Master W. Ruffin, These.â€™--

â€˜Dear sur, sum of our yong gulpins will not bite, thof I tuold them you
shoed me the squoireâ€™s own seel. But Tims will deliver you the lettrs as
desired, and tell ould Addem he gave them to squoirâ€™s bond, as to be sure
yours is the same, and shall be ready for signal, and hoy for Hoy Church
and Sachefrel, as fadur sings at harvestwhome. Yours, deer Sur,

â€˜H. H.

â€˜Poscriff.--Doâ€™e tell squoire we longs to heer from him, and has dootings
about his not writing himself, and Lifetenant Bottler is smoky.â€™

â€˜This Ruffin, I suppose, then, is your Donald of the Cavern, who has
intercepted your letters, and carried on a correspondence with the poor
devil Houghton, as if under your authority?â€™

â€˜It seems too true. But who can Addem be?â€™

â€˜Possibly Adam, for poor Gardiner, a sort of pun on his name.â€™

The other letters were to the same purpose; and they soon received yet
more complete light upon Donald Beanâ€™s machinations.

John Hodges, one of Waverleyâ€™s servants, who had remained with the
regiment and had been taken at Preston, now made his appearance. He had
sought out his master with the purpose of again entering his service.
From this fellow they learned that some time after Waverley had gone from
the headquarters of the regiment, a pedlar, called Ruthven, Rufnn, or
Rivane, known among the soldiers by the name of Wily Will, had made
frequent visits to the town of Dundee. He appeared to possess plenty of
money, sold his commodities very cheap, seemed always willing to treat
his friends at the ale-house, and easily ingratiated himself with many of
Waverleyâ€™s troop, particularly Sergeant Houghton and one Tims, also a
non-commissioned officer. To these he unfolded, in Waverleyâ€™s name, a
plan for leaving the regiment and joining him in the Highlands, where
report said the clans had already taken arms in great numbers. The men,
who had been educated as Jacobites, so far as they had any opinion at
all, and who knew their landlord, Sir Everard, had always been supposed
to hold such tenets, easily fell into the snare. That Waverley was at a
distance in the Highlands was received as a sufficient excuse for
transmitting his letters through the medium of the pedlar; and the sight
of his well-known seal seemed to authenticate the negotiations in his
name, where writing might have been dangerous. The cabal, however, began
to take air, from the premature mutinous language of those concerned.
Wily Will justified his appellative; for, after suspicion arose, he was
seen no more. When the â€˜Gazetteâ€™ appeared in which Waverley was
superseded, great part of his troop broke out into actual mutiny, but
were surrounded and disarmed by the rest of the regiment. In consequence
of the sentence of a court-martial, Houghton and Tims were condemned to
be shot, but afterwards permitted to cast lots for life. Houghton, the
survivor, showed much penitence, being convinced, from the rebukes and
explanations of Colonel Gardiner, that he had really engaged in a very
heinous crime. It is remarkable that, as soon as the poor fellow was
satisfied of this, he became also convinced that the instigator had acted
without authority from Edward, saying, â€˜If it was dishonourable and
against Old England, the squire could know nought about it; he never did,
or thought to do, anything dishonourable, no more didnâ€™t Sir Everard, nor
none of them afore him, and in that belief he would live and die that
Ruffin had done it all of his own head.â€™

The strength of conviction with which he expressed himself upon this
subject, as well as his assurances that the letters intended for Waverley
had been delivered to Ruthven, made that revolution in Colonel Gardinerâ€™s
opinion which he expressed to Talbot.

The reader has long since understood that Donald Bean Lean played the
part of tempter on this occasion. His motives were shortly these. Of an
active and intriguing spirit, he had been long employed as a subaltern
agent and spy by those in the confidence of the Chevalier, to an extent
beyond what was suspected even by Fergus Mac-Ivor, whom, though obliged
to him for protection, he regarded with fear and dislike. To success in
this political department he naturally looked for raising himself by some
bold stroke above his present hazardous and precarious trade of rapine.
He was particularly employed in learning the strength of the regiments in
Scotland, the character of the officers, etc., and had long had his eye
upon Waverleyâ€™s troop as open to temptation. Donald even believed that
Waverley himself was at bottom in the Stuart interest, which seemed
confirmed by his long visit to the Jacobite Baron of Bradwardine. When,
therefore, he came to his cave with one of Glennaquoichâ€™s attendants, the
robber, who could never appreciate his real motive, which was mere
curiosity, was so sanguine as to hope that his own talents were to be
employed in some intrigue of consequence, under the auspices of this
wealthy young Englishman. Nor was he undeceived by Waverleyâ€™s neglecting
all hints and openings afforded for explanation. His conduct passed for
prudent reserve, and somewhat piqued Donald Bean, who, supposing himself
left out of a secret where confidence promised to be advantageous,
determined to have his share in the drama, whether a regular part were
assigned him or not. For this purpose during Waverleyâ€™s sleep he
possessed himself of his seal, as a token to be used to any of the
troopers whom he might discover to be possessed of the captainâ€™s
confidence. His first journey to Dundee, the town where the regiment was
quartered, undeceived him in his original supposition, but opened to him
a new field of action. He knew there would be no service so well rewarded
by the friends of the Chevalier as seducing a part of the regular army to
his standard. For this purpose he opened the machinations with which the
reader is already acquainted, and which form a clue to all the
intricacies and obscurities of the narrative previous to Waverleyâ€™s
leaving Glennaquoich.

By Colonel Talbotâ€™s advice, Waverley declined detaining in his service
the lad whose evidence had thrown additional light on these intrigues. He
represented to him, that it would be doing the man an injury to engage
him in a desperate undertaking, and that, whatever should happen, his
evidence would go some length at least in explaining the circumstances
under which Waverley himself had embarked in it. Waverley therefore wrote
a short state of what had happened to his uncle and his father,
cautioning them, however, in the present circumstances, not to attempt to
answer his letter. Talbot then gave the young man a letter to the
commander of one of the English vessels of war cruising in the frith,
requesting him to put the bearer ashore at Berwick, with a pass to
proceed to ----shire. He was then furnished with money to make an
expeditious journey, and directed to get on board the ship by means of
bribing a fishing-boat, which, as they afterwards learned, he easily
effected.

Tired of the attendance of Callum Beg, who, he thought, had some
disposition to act as a spy on his motions, Waverley hired as a servant a
simple Edinburgh swain, who had mounted the white cockade in a fit of
spleen and jealousy, because Jenny Jop had danced a whole night with
Corporal Bullock of the Fusileers.





CHAPTER XXIII

INTRIGUES OF SOCIETY AND LOVE


Colonel Talbot became more kindly in his demeanour towards Waverley after
the confidence he had reposed in him, and, as they were necessarily much
together, the character of the Colonel rose in Waverleyâ€™s estimation.
There seemed at first something harsh in his strong expressions of
dislike and censure, although no one was in the general case more open to
conviction. The habit of authority had also given his manners some
peremptory hardness, notwithstanding the polish which they had received
from his intimate acquaintance with the higher circles. As a specimen of
the military character, he differed from all whom Waverley had as yet
seen. The soldiership of the Baron of Bradwardine was marked by pedantry;
that of Major Melville by a sort of martinet attention to the minutiae
and technicalities of discipline, rather suitable to one who was to
manoeuvre a battalion than to him who was to command an army; the
military spirit of Fergus was so much warped and blended with his plans
and political views, that it was less that of a soldier than of a petty
sovereign. But Colonel Talbot was in every point the English soldier. His
whole soul was devoted to the service of his king and country, without
feeling any pride in knowing the theory of his art with the Baron, or its
practical minutiae with the Major, or in applying his science to his own
particular plans of ambition, like the Chieftain of Glennaquoich. Added
to this, he was a man of extended knowledge and cultivated taste,
although strongly tinged, as we have already observed, with those
prejudices which are peculiarly English.

The character of Colonel Talbot dawned upon Edward by degrees; for the
delay of the Highlanders in the fruitless siege of Edinburgh Castle
occupied several weeks, during which Waverley had little to do excepting
to seek such amusement as society afforded. He would willingly have
persuaded his new friend to become acquainted with some of his former
intimates. But the Colonel, after one or two visits, shook his head, and
declined farther experiment. Indeed he went farther, and characterised
the Baron as the most intolerable formal pedant he had ever had the
misfortune to meet with, and the Chief of Glennaquoich as a Frenchified
Scotchman, possessing all the cunning and plausibility of the nation
where he was educated, with the proud, vindictive, and turbulent humour
of that of his birth. â€˜If the devil,â€™ he said, â€˜had sought out an agent
expressly for the purpose of embroiling this miserable country, I do not
think he could find a better than such a fellow as this, whose temper
seems equally active, supple, and mischievous, and who is followed, and
implicitly obeyed, by a gang of such cut-throats as those whom you are
pleased to admire so much.â€™

The ladies of the party did not escape his censure. He allowed that Flora
Mac-Ivor was a fine woman, and Rose Bradwardine a pretty girl. But he
alleged that the former destroyed the effect of her beauty by an
affectation of the grand airs which she had probably seen practised in
the mock court of St. Germains. As for Rose Bradwardine, he said it was
impossible for any mortal to admire such a little uninformed thing, whose
small portion of education was as ill adapted to her sex or youth as if
she had appeared with one of her fatherâ€™s old campaign-coats upon her
person for her sole garment. Now much of this was mere spleen and
prejudice in the excellent Colonel, with whom the white cockade on the
breast, the white rose in the hair, and the Mac at the beginning of a
name would have made a devil out of an angel; and indeed he himself
jocularly allowed that he could not have endured Venus herself if she had
been announced in a drawing-room by the name of Miss Mac-Jupiter.

Waverley, it may easily be believed, looked upon these young ladies with
very different eyes. During the period of the siege he paid them almost
daily visits, although he observed with regret that his suit made as
little progress in the affections of the former as the arms of the
Chevalier in subduing the fortress. She maintained with rigour the rule
she had laid down of treating him with indifference, without either
affecting to avoid him or to shun intercourse with him. Every word, every
look, was strictly regulated to accord with her system, and neither the
dejection of Waverley nor the anger which Fergus scarcely suppressed
could extend Floraâ€™s attention to Edward beyond that which the most
ordinary politeness demanded. On the other hand, Rose Bradwardine
gradually rose in Waverleyâ€™s opinion. He had several opportunities of
remarking that, as her extreme timidity wore off, her manners assumed a
higher character; that the agitating circumstances of the stormy time
seemed to call forth a certain dignity of feeling and expression which he
had not formerly observed; and that she omitted no opportunity within her
reach to extend her knowledge and refine her taste.

Flora Mac-Ivor called Rose her pupil, and was attentive to assist her in
her studies, and to fashion both her taste and understanding. It might
have been remarked by a very close observer that in the presence of
Waverley she was much more desirous to exhibit her friendâ€™s excellences
than her own. But I must request of the reader to suppose that this kind
and disinterested purpose was concealed by the most cautious delicacy,
studiously shunning the most distant approach to affectation. So that it
was as unlike the usual exhibition of one pretty woman affecting to
proner another as the friendship of David and Jonathan might be to the
intimacy of two Bond Street loungers. The fact is that, though the effect
was felt, the cause could hardly be observed. Each of the ladies, like
two excellent actresses, were perfect in their parts, and performed them
to the delight of the audience; and such being the case, it was almost
impossible to discover that the elder constantly ceded to her friend that
which was most suitable to her talents.

But to Waverley Rose Bradwardine possessed an attraction which few men
can resist, from the marked interest which she took in everything that
affected him. She was too young and too inexperienced to estimate the
full force of the constant attention which she paid to him. Her father
was too abstractedly immersed in learned and military discussions to
observe her partiality, and Flora Mac-Ivor did not alarm her by
remonstrance, because she saw in this line of conduct the most probable
chance of her friend securing at length a return of affection.

The truth is, that in her first conversation after their meeting Rose had
discovered the state of her mind to that acute and intelligent friend,
although she was not herself aware of it. From that time Flora was not
only determined upon the final rejection of Waverleyâ€™s addresses, but
became anxious that they should, if possible, be transferred to her
friend. Nor was she less interested in this plan, though her brother had
from time to time talked, as between jest and earnest, of paying his suit
to Miss Bradwardine. She knew that Fergus had the true continental
latitude of opinion respecting the institution of marriage, and would not
have given his hand to an angel unless for the purpose of strengthening
his alliances and increasing his influence and wealth. The Baronâ€™s whim
of transferring his estate to the distant heir-male, instead of his own
daughter, was therefore likely to be an insurmountable obstacle to his
entertaining any serious thoughts of Rose Bradwardine. Indeed, Fergusâ€™s
brain was a perpetual workshop of scheme and intrigue, of every possible
kind and description; while, like many a mechanic of more ingenuity than
steadiness, he would often unexpectedly, and without any apparent motive,
abandon one plan and go earnestly to work upon another, which was either
fresh from the forge of his imagination or had at some former period been
flung aside half finished. It was therefore often difficult to guess what
line of conduct he might finally adopt upon any given occasion.

Although Flora was sincerely attached to her brother, whose high energies
might indeed have commanded her admiration even without the ties which
bound them together, she was by no means blind to his faults, which she
considered as dangerous to the hopes of any woman who should found her
ideas of a happy marriage in the peaceful enjoyment of domestic society
and the exchange of mutual and engrossing affection. The real disposition
of Waverley, on the other hand, notwithstanding his dreams of tented
fields and military honour, seemed exclusively domestic. He asked and
received no share in the busy scenes which were constantly going on
around him, and was rather annoyed than interested by the discussion of
contending claims, rights, and interests which often passed in his
presence. All this pointed him out as the person formed to make happy a
spirit like that of Rose, which corresponded with his own.

She remarked this point in Waverleyâ€™s character one day while she sat
with Miss Bradwardine. â€˜His genius and elegant taste,â€™ answered Rose,
â€˜cannot be interested in such trifling discussions. What is it to him,
for example, whether the Chief of the Macindallaghers, who has brought
out only fifty men, should be a colonel or a captain? and how could Mr.
Waverley be supposed to interest himself in the violent altercation
between your brother and young Corrinaschian whether the post of honour
is due to the eldest cadet of a clan or the youngest?â€™

â€˜My dear Rose, if he were the hero you suppose him he would interest
himself in these matters, not indeed as important in themselves, but for
the purpose of mediating between the ardent spirits who actually do make
them the subject of discord. You saw when Corrinaschian raised his voice
in great passion, and laid his hand upon his sword, Waverley lifted his
head as if he had just awaked from a dream, and asked with great
composure what the matter was.â€™

â€˜Well, and did not the laughter they fell into at his absence of mind
serve better to break off the dispute than anything he could have said to
them?â€™

â€˜True, my dear,â€™ answered Flora; â€˜but not quite so creditably for
Waverley as if he had brought them to their senses by force of reason.â€™

â€˜Would you have him peacemaker general between all the gunpowder
Highlanders in the army? I beg your pardon, Flora, your brother, you
know, is out of the question; he has more sense than half of them. But
can you think the fierce, hot, furious spirits of whose brawls we see
much and hear more, and who terrify me out of my life every day in the
world, are at all to be compared to Waverley?â€™

â€˜I do not compare him with those uneducated men, my dear Rose. I only
lament that, with his talents and genius, he does not assume that place
in society for which they eminently fit him, and that he does not lend
their full impulse to the noble cause in which he has enlisted. Are there
not Lochiel, and P--, and M--, and G--, all men of the highest education
as well as the first talents,--why will he not stoop like them to be
alive and useful? I often believe his zeal is frozen by that proud
cold-blooded Englishman whom he now lives with so much.â€™

â€˜Colonel Talbot? he is a very disagreeable person, to be sure. He looks
as if he thought no Scottish woman worth the trouble of handing her a cup
of tea. But Waverley is so gentle, so well informed--â€™

â€˜Yes,â€™ said Flora, smiling, â€˜he can admire the moon and quote a stanza
from Tasso.â€™

â€˜Besides, you know how he fought,â€™ added Miss Bradwardine.

â€˜For mere fighting,â€™ answered Flora,â€™ I believe all men (that is, who
deserve the name) are pretty much alike; there is generally more courage
required to run away. They have besides, when confronted with each other,
a certain instinct for strife, as we see in other male animals, such as
dogs, bulls, and so forth. But high and perilous enterprise is not
Waverleyâ€™s forte. He would never have been his celebrated ancestor Sir
Nigel, but only Sir Nigelâ€™s eulogist and poet. I will tell you where he
will be at home, my dear, and in his place--in the quiet circle of
domestic happiness, lettered indolence, and elegant enjoyments of
Waverley-Honour. And he will refit the old library in the most exquisite
Gothic taste, and garnish its shelves with the rarest and most valuable
volumes; and he will draw plans and landscapes, and write verses, and
rear temples, and dig grottoes; and he will stand in a clear summer night
in the colonnade before the hall, and gaze on the deer as they stray in
the moonlight, or lie shadowed by the boughs of the huge old fantastic
oaks; and he will repeat verses to his beautiful wife, who will hang upon
his arm;--and he will be a happy man.â€™

And she will be a happy woman, thought poor Rose. But she only sighed and
dropped the conversation.




CHAPTER XXIV

FERGUS A SUITOR


Waverley had, indeed, as he looked closer into the state of the
Chevalierâ€™s court, less reason to be satisfied with it. It contained, as
they say an acorn includes all the ramifications of the future oak, as
many seeds of tracasserie and intrigue as might have done honour to the
court of a large empire. Every person of consequence had some separate
object, which he pursued with a fury that Waverley considered as
altogether disproportioned to its importance. Almost all had their
reasons for discontent, although the most legitimate was that of the
worthy old Baron, who was only distressed on account of the common cause.

â€˜We shall hardly,â€™ said he one morning to Waverley when they had been
viewing the Castle--â€˜we shall hardly gain the obsidional crown, which you
wot well was made of the roots or grain which takes root within the place
besieged, or it may be of the herb woodbind, parietaria, or pellitory; we
shall not, I say, gain it by this same blockade or leaguer of Edinburgh
Castle.â€™ For this opinion he gave most learned and satisfactory reasons,
that the reader may not care to hear repeated.

Having escaped from the old gentleman, Waverley went to Fergusâ€™s lodgings
by appointment, to await his return from Holyrood House. â€˜I am to have a
particular audience to-morrow,â€™ said Fergus to Waverley overnight, â€˜and
you must meet me to wish me joy of the success which I securely
anticipate.â€™

The morrow came, and in the Chiefâ€™s apartment he found Ensign Maccombich
waiting to make report of his turn of duty in a sort of ditch which they
had dug across the Castle-hill and called a trench. In a short time the
Chiefâ€™s voice was heard on the stair in a tone of impatient fury:
â€˜Callum! why, Callum Beg! Diaoul!â€™ He entered the room with all the marks
of a man agitated by a towering passion; and there were few upon whose
features rage produced a more violent effect. The veins of his forehead
swelled when he was in such agitation; his nostril became dilated; his
cheek and eye inflamed; and his look that of a demoniac. These
appearances of half-suppressed rage were the more frightful because they
were obviously caused by a strong effort to temper with discretion an
almost ungovernable paroxysm of passion, and resulted from an internal
conflict of the most dreadful kind, which agitated his whole frame of
mortality.

As he entered the apartment he unbuckled his broadsword, and throwing it
down with such violence that the weapon rolled to the other end of the
room, â€˜I know not what,â€™ he exclaimed, â€˜withholds me from taking a solemn
oath that I will never more draw it in his cause. Load my pistols,
Callum, and bring them hither instantly--instantly!â€™ Callum, whom nothing
ever startled, dismayed, or disconcerted, obeyed very coolly. Evan Dhu,
upon whose brow the suspicion that his Chief had been insulted called up
a corresponding storm, swelled in sullen silence, awaiting to learn where
or upon whom vengeance was to descend.

â€˜So, Waverley, you are there,â€™ said the Chief, after a momentâ€™s
recollection. â€˜Yes, I remember I asked you to share my triumph, and you
have come to witness my disappointment we shall call it.â€™ Evan now
presented the written report he had in his hand, which Fergus threw from
him with great passion. â€˜I wish to God,â€™ he said, â€˜the old den would
tumble down upon the heads of the fools who attack and the knaves who
defend it! I see, Waverley, you think I am mad. Leave us, Evan, but be
within call.â€™

â€˜The Colonelâ€™s in an unco kippage,â€™ said Mrs. Flockhart to Evan as he
descended; â€˜I wish he may be weel,--the very veins on his brent brow are
swelled like whipcord; wad he no tak something?â€™

â€˜He usually lets blood for these fits,â€™ answered the Highland ancient
with great composure.

When this officer left the room, the Chieftain gradually reassumed some
degree of composure. â€˜I know, Waverley,â€™ he said, â€˜that Colonel Talbot
has persuaded you to curse ten times a day your engagement with us; nay,
never deny it, for I am at this moment tempted to curse my own. Would you
believe it, I made this very morning two suits to the Prince, and he has
rejected them both; what do you think of it?â€™

â€˜What can I think,â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜till I know what your requests
were?â€™ â€˜Why, what signifies what they were, man? I tell you it was I that
made them--I to whom he owes more than to any three who have joined the
standard; for I negotiated the whole business, and brought in all the
Perthshire men when not one would have stirred. I am not likely, I think,
to ask anything very unreasonable, and if I did, they might have
stretched a point. Well, but you shall know all, now that I can draw my
breath again with some freedom. You remember my earlâ€™s patent; it is
dated some years back, for services then rendered; and certainly my merit
has not been diminished, to say the least, by my subsequent behaviour.
Now, sir, I value this bauble of a coronet as little as you can, or any
philosopher on earth; for I hold that the chief of such a clan as the
Sliochd nan Ivor is superior in rank to any earl in Scotland. But I had a
particular reason for assuming this cursed title at this time. You must
know that I learned accidentally that the Prince has been pressing that
old foolish Baron of Bradwardine to disinherit his male heir, or
nineteenth or twentieth cousin, who has taken a command in the Elector of
Hanoverâ€™s militia, and to settle his estate upon your pretty little
friend Rose; and this, as being the command of his king and overlord, who
may alter the destination of a fief at pleasure, the old gentleman seems
well reconciled to.â€™

â€˜And what becomes of the homage?â€™

â€˜Curse the homage! I believe Rose is to pull off the queenâ€™s slipper on
her coronation-day, or some such trash. Well, sir, as Rose Bradwardine
would always have made a suitable match for me but for this idiotical
predilection of her father for the heir-male, it occurred to me there now
remained no obstacle unless that the Baron might expect his daughterâ€™s
husband to take the name of Bradwardine (which you know would be
impossible in my case), and that this might be evaded by my assuming the
title to which I had so good a right, and which, of course, would
supersede that difficulty. If she was to be also Viscountess Bradwardine
in her own right after her fatherâ€™s demise, so much the better; I could
have no objection.â€™

â€˜But, Fergus,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜I had no idea that you had any affection
for Miss Bradwardine, and you are always sneering at her father.â€™

â€˜I have as much affection for Miss Bradwardine, my good friend, as I
think it necessary to have for the future mistress of my family and the
mother of my children. She is a very pretty, intelligent girl, and is
certainly of one of the very first Lowland families; and, with a little
of Floraâ€™s instructions and forming, will make a very good figure. As to
her father, he is an original, it is true, and an absurd one enough; but
he has given such severe lessons to Sir Hew Halbert, that dear defunct
the Laird of Balmawhapple, and others, that nobody dare laugh at him, so
his absurdity goes for nothing. I tell you there could have been no
earthly objection--none. I had settled the thing entirely in my own
mind.â€™

â€˜But had you asked the Baronâ€™s consent,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜or Roseâ€™s?â€™

â€˜To what purpose? To have spoke to the Baron before I had assumed my
title would have only provoked a premature and irritating discussion on
the subject of the change of name, when, as Earl of Glennaquoich, I had
only to propose to him to carry his d--d bear and bootjack party per
pale, or in a scutcheon of pretence, or in a separate shield perhaps--any
way that would not blemish my own coat of arms. And as to Rose, I donâ€™t
see what objection she could have made if her father was satisfied.â€™

â€˜Perhaps the same that your sister makes to me, you being satisfied.â€™

Fergus gave a broad stare at the comparison which this supposition
implied, but cautiously suppressed the answer which rose to his tongue.
â€˜O, we should easily have arranged all that. So, sir, I craved a private
interview, and this morning was assigned; and I asked you to meet me
here, thinking, like a fool, that I should want your countenance as
brideâ€™s-man. Well, I state my pretension--they are not denied; the
promises so repeatedly made and the patent granted--they are
acknowledged. But I propose, as a natural consequence, to assume the rank
which the patent bestowed. I have the old story of the jealousy of
C----and M----trumped up against me. I resist this pretext, and offer to
procure their written acquiescence, in virtue of the date of my patent as
prior to their silly claims; I assure you I would have had such a consent
from them, if it had been at the point of the sword. And then out comes
the real truth; and he dares to tell me to my face that my patent must be
suppressed for the present, for fear of disgusting that rascally coward
and faineant (naming the rival chief of his own clan), who has no better
title to be a chieftain than I to be Emperor of China, and who is pleased
to shelter his dastardly reluctance to come out, agreeable to his promise
twenty times pledged, under a pretended jealousy of the Princeâ€™s
partiality to me. And, to leave this miserable driveller without a
pretence for his cowardice, the Prince asks it as a personal favour of
me, forsooth, not to press my just and reasonable request at this moment.
After this, put your faith in princes!â€™

â€˜And did your audience end here?â€™

â€˜End? O no! I was determined to leave him no pretence for his
ingratitude, and I therefore stated, with all the composure I could
muster,--for I promise you I trembled with passion,--the particular
reasons I had for wishing that his Royal Highness would impose upon me
any other mode of exhibiting my duty and devotion, as my views in life
made what at any other time would have been a mere trifle at this crisis
a severe sacrifice; and then I explained to him my full plan.â€™

â€˜And what did the Prince answer?â€™

â€˜Answer? why--it is well it is written, â€œCurse not the king, no, not in
thy thought!â€--why, he answered that truly he was glad I had made him my
confidant, to prevent more grievous disappointment, for he could assure
me, upon the word of a prince, that Miss Bradwardineâ€™s affections were
engaged, and he was under a particular promise to favour them. â€œSo, my
dear Fergus,â€ said he, with his most gracious cast of smile, â€œas the
marriage is utterly out of question, there need be no hurry, you know,
about the earldom.â€ And so he glided off and left me plante lÃ .â€™

â€˜And what did you do?â€™

â€˜Iâ€™ll tell you what I COULD have done at that moment--sold myself to the
devil or the Elector, whichever offered the dearest revenge. However, I
am now cool. I know he intends to marry her to some of his rascally
Frenchmen or his Irish officers, but I will watch them close; and let the
man that would supplant me look well to himself. Bisogna coprirsi,
Signor.â€™

After some further conversation, unnecessary to be detailed, Waverley
took leave of the Chieftain, whose fury had now subsided into a deep and
strong desire of vengeance, and returned home, scarce able to analyse the
mixture of feelings which the narrative had awakened in his own bosom.




CHAPTER XXV

â€˜TO ONE THING CONSTANT NEVERâ€™


â€˜I am the very child of caprice,â€™ said Waverley to himself, as he bolted
the door of his apartment and paced it with hasty steps. â€˜What is it to
me that Fergus Mac-Ivor should wish to marry Rose Bradwardine? I love her
not; I might have been loved by her perhaps; but rejected her simple,
natural, and affecting attachment, instead of cherishing it into
tenderness, and dedicated myself to one who will never love mortal man,
unless old Warwick, the King-maker, should arise from the dead. The Baron
too--I would not have cared about his estate, and so the name would have
been no stumbling-block. The devil might have taken the barren moors and
drawn off the royal calig&aelig; for anything I would have minded. But, framed
as she is for domestic affection and tenderness, for giving and receiving
all those kind and quiet attentions which sweeten life to those who pass
it together, she is sought by Fergus Mac-Ivor. He will not use her ill,
to be sure; of that he is incapable. But he will neglect her after the
first month; he will be too intent on subduing some rival chieftain or
circumventing some favourite at court, on gaining some heathy hill and
lake or adding to his bands some new troop of caterans, to inquire what
she does, or how she amuses herself.
    And then will canker sorrow eat her bud,
    And chase the native beauty from her cheek;
    And she will look as hollow as a ghost,
    And dim and meagre as an ague fit,
    And so sheâ€™ll die.
And such a catastrophe of the most gentle creature on earth might have
been prevented if Mr. Edward Waverley had had his eyes! Upon my word, I
cannot understand how I thought Flora so much, that is, so very much,
handsomer than Rose. She is taller indeed, and her manner more formed;
but many people think Miss Bradwardineâ€™s more natural; and she is
certainly much younger. I should think Flora is two years older than I
am. I will look at them particularly this evening.â€™

And with this resolution Waverley went to drink tea (as the fashion was
Sixty Years Since) at the house of a lady of quality attached to the
cause of the Chevalier, where he found, as he expected, both the ladies.
All rose as he entered, but Flora immediately resumed her place and the
conversation in which she was engaged. Rose, on the contrary, almost
imperceptibly made a little way in the crowded circle for his advancing
the corner of a chair. â€˜Her manner, upon the whole, is most engaging,â€™
said Waverley to himself.

A dispute occurred whether the Gaelic or Italian language was most
liquid, and best adapted for poetry; the opinion for the Gaelic, which
probably might not have found supporters elsewhere, was here fiercely
defended by seven Highland ladies, who talked at the top of their lungs,
and screamed the company deaf with examples of Celtic euphonia. Flora,
observing the Lowland ladies sneer at the comparison, produced some
reasons to show that it was not altogether so absurd; but Rose, when
asked for her opinion, gave it with animation in praise of Italian, which
she had studied with Waverleyâ€™s assistance. â€œShe has a more correct ear
than Flora, though a less accomplished musician,â€ said Waverley to
himself. â€˜I suppose Miss Mac-Ivor will next compare Mac-Murrough nan Fonn
to Ariosto!â€™

Lastly, it so befell that the company differed whether Fergus should be
asked to perform on the flute, at which he was an adept, or Waverley
invited to read a play of Shakspeare; and the lady of the house
good-humouredly undertook to collect the votes of the company for poetry
or music, under the condition that the gentleman whose talents were not
laid under contribution that evening should contribute them to enliven
the next. It chanced that Rose had the casting vote. Now Flora, who
seemed to impose it as a rule upon herself never to countenance any
proposal which might seem to encourage Waverley, had voted for music,
providing the Baron would take his violin to accompany Fergus. â€˜I wish
you joy of your taste, Miss Mac-Ivor,â€™ thought Edward, as they sought for
his book. â€˜I thought it better when we were at Glennaquoich; but
certainly the Baron is no great performer, and Shakspeare is worth
listening to.â€™

â€˜Romeo and Julietâ€™ was selected, and Edward read with taste, feeling, and
spirit several scenes from that play. All the company applauded with
their hands, and many with their tears. Flora, to whom the drama was well
known, was among the former; Rose, to whom it was altogether new,
belonged to the latter class of admirers. â€˜She has more feeling too,â€™
said Waverley, internally.

The conversation turning upon the incidents of the play and upon the
characters, Fergus declared that the only one worth naming, as a man of
fashion and spirit, was Mercutio. â€˜I could not,â€™ he said, â€˜quite follow
all his old-fashioned wit, but he must have been a very pretty fellow,
according to the ideas of his time.â€™

â€˜And it was a shame,â€™ said Ensign Maccombich, who usually followed his
Colonel everywhere, â€˜for that Tibbert, or Taggart, or whatever was his
name, to stick him under the other gentlemanâ€™s arm while he was redding
the fray.â€™

The ladies, of course, declared loudly in favour of Romeo, but this
opinion did not go undisputed. The mistress of the house and several
other ladies severely reprobated the levity with which the hero transfers
his affections from Rosalind to Juliet. Flora remained silent until her
opinion was repeatedly requested, and then answered, she thought the
circumstance objected to not only reconcilable to nature, but such as in
the highest degree evinced the art of the poet. â€˜Romeo is described,â€™
said she, â€˜as a young man peculiarly susceptible of the softer passions;
his love is at first fixed upon a woman who could afford it no return;
this he repeatedly tells you,--

    From loveâ€™s weak, childish bow she lives unharmed,

and again--

    She hath forsworn to love.

Now, as it was impossible that Romeoâ€™s love, supposing him a reasonable
being, could continue to subsist without hope, the poet has, with great
art, seized the moment when he was reduced actually to despair to throw
in his way an object more accomplished than her by whom he had been
rejected, and who is disposed to repay his attachment. I can scarce
conceive a situation more calculated to enhance the ardour of Romeoâ€™s
affection for Juliet than his being at once raised by her from the state
of drooping melancholy in which he appears first upon the scene to the
ecstatic state in which he exclaims--

          --come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short moment gives me in her sight.â€™

â€˜Good now, Miss Mac-Ivor,â€™ said a young lady of quality, â€˜do you mean to
cheat us out of our prerogative? will you persuade us love cannot subsist
without hope, or that the lover must become fickle if the lady is cruel?
O fie! I did not expect such an unsentimental conclusion.â€™

â€˜A lover, my dear Lady Betty,â€™ said Flora, â€˜may, I conceive, persevere in
his suit under very discouraging circumstances. Affection can (now and
then) withstand very severe storms of rigour, but not a long polar frost
of downright indifference. Donâ€™t, even with YOUR attractions, try the
experiment upon any lover whose faith you value. Love will subsist on
wonderfully little hope, but not altogether without it.â€™

â€˜It will be just like Duncan Mac-Girdieâ€™s mare,â€™ said Evan, â€˜if your
ladyships please, he wanted to use her by degrees to live without meat,
and just as he had put her on a straw a day the poor thing died!â€™

Evanâ€™s illustration set the company a-laughing, and the discourse took a
different turn. Shortly afterwards the party broke up, and Edward
returned home, musing on what Flora had said. â€˜I will love my Rosalind no
more,â€™ said he; â€˜she has given me a broad enough hint for that; and I
will speak to her brother and resign my suit. But for a Juliet--would it
be handsome to interfere with Fergusâ€™s pretensions? though it is
impossible they can ever succeed; and should they miscarry, what then?
why then alors comme alors.â€™ And with this resolution of being guided by
circumstances did our hero commit himself to repose.




CHAPTER XXVI

A BRAVE MAN IN SORROW


If my fair readers should be of opinion that my heroâ€™s levity in love is
altogether unpardonable, I must remind them that all his griefs and
difficulties did not arise from that sentimental source. Even the lyric
poet who complains so feelingly of the pains of love could not forget,
that at the same time he was â€˜in debt and in drink,â€™ which, doubtless,
were great aggravations of his distress. There were, indeed, whole days
in which Waverley thought neither of Flora nor Rose Bradwardine, but
which were spent in melancholy conjectures on the probable state of
matters at Waverley-Honour, and the dubious issue of the civil contest in
which he was pledged. Colonel Talbot often engaged him in discussions
upon the justice of the cause he had espoused. â€˜Not,â€™ he said, â€˜that it
is possible for you to quit it at this present moment, for, come what
will, you must stand by your rash engagement. But I wish you to be aware
that the right is not with you; that you are fighting against the real
interests of your country; and that you ought, as an Englishman and a
patriot, to take the first opportunity to leave this unhappy expedition
before the snowball melts.â€™

In such political disputes Waverley usually opposed the common arguments
of his party, with which it is unnecessary to trouble the reader. But he
had little to say when the Colonel urged him to compare the strength by
which they had undertaken to overthrow the government with that which was
now assembling very rapidly for its support. To this statement Waverley
had but one answer: â€˜If the cause I have undertaken be perilous, there
would be the greater disgrace in abandoning it.â€™ And in his turn he
generally silenced Colonel Talbot, and succeeded in changing the subject.

One night, when, after a long dispute of this nature, the friends had
separated and our hero had retired to bed, he was awakened about midnight
by a suppressed groan. He started up and listened; it came from the
apartment of Colonel Talbot, which was divided from his own by a
wainscotted partition, with a door of communication. Waverley approached
this door and distinctly heard one or two deep-drawn sighs. What could be
the matter? The Colonel had parted from him apparently in his usual state
of spirits. He must have been taken suddenly ill. Under this impression
he opened the door of communication very gently, and perceived the
Colonel, in his night-gown, seated by a table, on which lay a letter and
a picture. He raised his head hastily, as Edward stood uncertain whether
to advance or retire, and Waverley perceived that his cheeks were stained
with tears.

As if ashamed at being found giving way to such emotion, Colonel Talbot
rose with apparent displeasure and said, with some sternness, â€˜I think,
Mr. Waverley, my own apartment and the hour might have secured even a
prisoner against--â€™

â€˜Do not say INTRUSION, Colonel Talbot; I heard you breathe hard and
feared you were ill; that alone could have induced me to break in upon
you.â€™

â€˜I am well,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜perfectly well.â€™

â€˜But you are distressed,â€™ said Edward; â€˜is there anything can be done?â€™

â€˜Nothing, Mr. Waverley; I was only thinking of home, and some unpleasant
occurrences there.â€™

â€˜Good God, my uncle!â€™ exclaimed Waverley.

â€˜No, it is a grief entirely my own. I am ashamed you should have seen it
disarm me so much; but it must have its course at times, that it may be
at others more decently supported. I would have kept it secret from you;
for I think it will grieve you, and yet you can administer no
consolation. But you have surprised me,--I see you are surprised
yourself,--and I hate mystery. Read that letter.â€™

The letter was from Colonel Talbotâ€™s sister, and in these words:--

â€˜I received yours, my dearest brother, by Hodges. Sir E. W. and Mr. R.
are still at large, but are not permitted to leave London. I wish to
Heaven I could give you as good an account of matters in the square. But
the news of the unhappy affair at Preston came upon us, with the dreadful
addition that you were among the fallen. You know Lady Emilyâ€™s state of
health, when your friendship for Sir E. induced you to leave her. She was
much harassed with the sad accounts from Scotland of the rebellion having
broken out; but kept up her spirits, as, she said, it became your wife,
and for the sake of the future heir, so long hoped for in vain. Alas, my
dear brother, these hopes are now ended! Notwithstanding all my watchful
care, this unhappy rumour reached her without preparation. She was taken
ill immediately; and the poor infant scarce survived its birth. Would to
God this were all! But although the contradiction of the horrible report
by your own letter has greatly revived her spirits, yet Dr.
----apprehends, I grieve to say, serious, and even dangerous,
consequences to her health, especially from the uncertainty in which she
must necessarily remain for some time, aggravated by the ideas she has
formed of the ferocity of those with whom you are a prisoner.

â€˜Do therefore, my dear brother, as soon as this reaches you, endeavour to
gain your release, by parole, by ransom, or any way that is practicable.
I do not exaggerate Lady Emilyâ€™s state of health; but I must not--dare
not--suppress the truth. Ever, my dear Philip, your most affectionate
sister,

â€˜Lucy TALBOT.â€™

Edward stood motionless when he had perused this letter; for the
conclusion was inevitable, that, by the Colonelâ€™s journey in quest of
him, he had incurred this heavy calamity. It was severe enough, even in
its irremediable part; for Colonel Talbot and Lady Emily, long without a
family, had fondly exulted in the hopes which were now blasted. But this
disappointment was nothing to the extent of the threatened evil; and
Edward, with horror, regarded himself as the original cause of both.

Ere he could collect himself sufficiently to speak, Colonel Talbot had
recovered his usual composure of manner, though his troubled eye denoted
his mental agony.

â€˜She is a woman, my young friend, who may justify even a soldierâ€™s
tears.â€™ He reached him the miniature, exhibiting features which fully
justified the eulogium; â€˜and yet, God knows, what you see of her there is
the least of the charms she possesses--possessed, I should perhaps
say--but Godâ€™s will be done.â€™

â€˜You must fly--you must fly instantly to her relief. It is not--it shall
not be too late.â€™

â€˜Fly? how is it possible? I am a prisoner, upon parole.â€™

â€˜I am your keeper; I restore your parole; I am to answer for you.â€™

â€˜You cannot do so consistently with your duty; nor can I accept a
discharge from you, with due regard to my own honour; you would be made
responsible.â€™

â€˜I will answer it with my head, if necessary,â€™ said Waverley impetuously.
â€˜I have been the unhappy cause of the loss of your child, make me not the
murderer of your wife.â€™

â€˜No, my dear Edward,â€™ said Talbot, taking him kindly by the hand, â€˜you
are in no respect to blame; and if I concealed this domestic distress for
two days, it was lest your sensibility should view it in that light. You
could not think of me, hardly knew of my existence, when I left England
in quest of you. It is a responsibility, Heaven knows, sufficiently heavy
for mortality, that we must answer for the foreseen and direct result of
our actions; for their indirect and consequential operation the great and
good Being, who alone can foresee the dependence of human events on each
other, hath not pronounced his frail creatures liable.â€™

â€˜But that you should have left Lady Emily,â€™ said Waverley, with much
emotion, â€˜in the situation of all others the most interesting to a
husband, to seek a--â€™

â€˜I only did my duty,â€™ answered Colonel Talbot, calmly, â€˜and I do not,
ought not, to regret it. If the path of gratitude and honour were always
smooth and easy, there would be little merit in following it; but it
moves often in contradiction to our interest and passions, and sometimes
to our better affections. These are the trials of life, and this, though
not the least bitterâ€™ (the tears came unbidden to his eyes), â€˜is not the
first which it has been my fate to encounter. But we will talk of this
to-morrow,â€™ he said, wringing Waverleyâ€™s hands. â€˜Good-night; strive to
forget it for a few hours. It will dawn, I think, by six, and it is now
past two. Good-night.â€™

Edward retired, without trusting his voice with a reply.




CHAPTER XXVII

EXERTION


When Colonel Talbot entered the breakfast-parlour next morning, he
learned from Waverleyâ€™s servant that our hero had been abroad at an early
hour and was not yet returned. The morning was well advanced before he
again appeared. He arrived out of breath, but with an air of joy that
astonished Colonel Talbot.

â€˜There,â€™ said he, throwing a paper on the table, â€˜there is my morningâ€™s
work. Alick, pack up the Colonelâ€™s clothes. Make haste, make haste.â€™

The Colonel examined the paper with astonishment. It was a pass from the
Chevalier to Colonel Talbot, to repair to Leith, or any other port in
possession of his Royal Highnessâ€™s troops, and there to embark for
England or elsewhere, at his free pleasure; he only giving his parole of
honour not to bear arms against the house of Stuart for the space of a
twelve-month.

â€˜In the name of God,â€™ said the Colonel, his eyes sparkling with
eagerness, â€˜how did you obtain this?â€™

â€˜I was at the Chevalierâ€™s levee as soon as he usually rises. He was gone
to the camp at Duddingston. I pursued him thither, asked and obtained an
audience--but I will tell you not a word more, unless I see you begin to
pack.â€™

â€˜Before I know whether I can avail myself of this passport, or how it was
obtained?â€™

â€˜O, you can take out the things again, you know. Now I see you busy, I
will go on. When I first mentioned your name, his eyes sparkled almost as
bright as yours did two minutes since. â€œHad you,â€ he earnestly asked,
â€œshown any sentiments favourable to his cause?â€ â€œNot in the least, nor
was there any hope you would do so.â€ His countenance fell. I requested
your freedom. â€œImpossible,â€ he said; â€œyour importance as a friend and
confidant of such and such personages made my request altogether
extravagant.â€ I told him my own story and yours; and asked him to judge
what my feelings must be by his own. He has a heart, and a kind one,
Colonel Talbot, you may say what you please. He took a sheet of paper and
wrote the pass with his own hand. â€œI will not trust myself with my
council,â€ he said; â€œthey will argue me out of what is right. I will not
endure that a friend, valued as I value you, should be loaded with the
painful reflections which must afflict you in case of further misfortune
in Colonel Talbotâ€™s family; nor will I keep a brave enemy a prisoner
under such circumstances. Besides,â€ said he, â€œI think I can justify
myself to my prudent advisers by pleading the good effect such lenity
will produce on the minds of the great English families with whom Colonel
Talbot is connected.â€â€™

â€˜There the politician peeped out,â€™ said the Colonel.

â€˜Well, at least he concluded like a kingâ€™s son: â€œTake the passport; I
have added a condition for formâ€™s sake; but if the Colonel objects to it,
let him depart without giving any parole whatever. I come here to war
with men, but not to distress or endanger women.â€â€™

â€˜Well, I never thought to have been so much indebted to the Pretend--â€™

â€˜To the Prince,â€™ said Waverley, smiling.

â€˜To the Chevalier,â€™ said the Colonel; â€˜it is a good travelling name, and
which we may both freely use. Did he say anything more?â€™

â€˜Only asked if there was anything else he could oblige me in; and when I
replied in the negative, he shook me by the hand, and wished all his
followers were as considerate, since some friends of mine not only asked
all he had to bestow, but many things which were entirely out of his
power, or that of the greatest sovereign upon earth. Indeed, he said, no
prince seemed, in the eyes of his followers, so like the Deity as
himself, if you were to judge from the extravagant requests which they
daily preferred to him.â€™

â€˜Poor young gentleman,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜I suppose he begins to feel
the difficulties of his situation. Well, dear Waverley, this is more than
kind, and shall not be forgotten while Philip Talbot can remember
anything. My life--pshaw--let Emily thank you for that; this is a favour
worth fifty lives. I cannot hesitate on giving my parole in the
circumstances; there it is (he wrote it out in form). And now, how am I
to get off?â€™

â€˜All that is settled: your baggage is packed, my horses wait, and a boat
has been engaged, by the Princeâ€™s permission, to put you on board the Fox
frigate. I sent a messenger down to Leith on purpose.â€™

â€˜That will do excellently well. Captain Beaver is my particular friend;
he will put me ashore at Berwick or Shields, from whence I can ride post
to London; and you must entrust me with the packet of papers which you
recovered by means of your Miss Bean Lean. I may have an opportunity of
using them to your advantage. But I see your Highland friend, Glen ----
what do you call his barbarous name? and his orderly with him; I must not
call him his orderly cut-throat any more, I suppose. See how he walks as
if the world were his own, with the bonnet on one side of his head and
his plaid puffed out across his breast! I should like now to meet that
youth where my hands were not tied: I would tame his pride, or he should
tame mine.â€™

â€˜For shame, Colonel Talbot! you swell at sight of tartan as the bull is
said to do at scarlet. You and Mac-Ivor have some points not much unlike,
so far as national prejudice is concerned.â€™

The latter part of this discourse took place in the street. They passed
the Chief, the Colonel and he sternly and punctiliously greeting each
other, like two duellists before they take their ground. It was evident
the dislike was mutual. â€˜I never see that surly fellow that dogs his
heels,â€™ said the Colonel, after he had mounted his horse, â€˜but he reminds
me of lines I have somewhere heard--upon the stage, I think:--

    Close behind him
    Stalks sullen Bertram, like a sorcererâ€™s fiend,
    Pressing to be employed.

â€˜I assure you, Colonel,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜that you judge too harshly of the
Highlanders.â€™

â€˜Not a whit, not a whit; I cannot spare them a jot; I cannot bate them an
ace. Let them stay in their own barren mountains, and puff and swell, and
hang their bonnets on the horns of the moon, if they have a mind; but
what business have they to come where people wear breeches, and speak an
intelligible language? I mean intelligible in comparison to their
gibberish, for even the Lowlanders talk a kind of English little better
than the Negroes in Jamaica. I could pity the Pr----, I mean the,
Chevalier himself, for having so many desperadoes about him. And they
learn their trade so early. There is a kind of subaltern imp, for
example, a sort of sucking devil, whom your friend Glena----Glenamuck
there, has sometimes in his train. To look at him, he is about fifteen
years; but he is a century old in mischief and villainy. He was playing
at quoits the other day in the court; a gentleman, a decent-looking
person enough, came past, and as a quoit hit his shin, he lifted his
cane; but my young bravo whips out his pistol, like Beau Clincher in the
â€œTrip to the Jubilee,â€ and had not a scream of Gardez lâ€™eau from an upper
window set all parties a-scampering for fear of the inevitable
consequences, the poor gentleman would have lost his life by the hands of
that little cockatrice.â€™

â€˜A fine character youâ€™ll give of Scotland upon your return, Colonel
Talbot.â€™

â€˜O, Justice Shallow,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜will save me the
trouble--â€œBarren, barren, beggars all, beggars all. Marry, good
air,â€--and that only when you are fairly out of Edinburgh, and not yet
come to Leith, as is our case at present.â€™

In a short time they arrived at the seaport.

The boat rockâ€™d at the pier of Leith, Full loud the wind blew down the
ferry; The ship rode at the Berwick Law.

â€˜Farewell, Colonel; may you find all as you would wish it! Perhaps we may
meet sooner than you expect; they talk of an immediate route to England.â€™

â€˜Tell me nothing of that,â€™ said Talbot; â€˜I wish to carry no news of your
motions.â€™

â€˜Simply, then, adieu. Say, with a thousand kind greetings, all that is
dutiful and affectionate to Sir Everard and Aunt Rachel. Think of me as
kindly as you can, speak of me as indulgently as your conscience will
permit, and once more adieu.â€™

â€˜And adieu, my dear Waverley; many, many thanks for your kindness.
Unplaid yourself on the first opportunity. I shall ever think on you with
gratitude, and the worst of my censure shall be, Que diable alloit-il
faire dans cette galere?â€™

And thus they parted, Colonel Talbot going on board of the boat and
Waverley returning to Edinburgh.




CHAPTER XXVIII

THE MARCH


It is not our purpose to intrude upon the province of history. We shall
therefore only remind our readers that about the beginning of November
the Young Chevalier, at the head of about six thousand men at the utmost,
resolved to peril his cause on an attempt to penetrate into the centre of
England, although aware of the mighty preparations which were made for
his reception. They set forward on this crusade in weather which would
have rendered any other troops incapable of marching, but which in
reality gave these active mountaineers advantages over a less hardy
enemy. In defiance of a superior army lying upon the Borders, under
Field-Marshal Wade, they besieged and took Carlisle, and soon afterwards
prosecuted their daring march to the southward.

As Colonel Mac-Ivorâ€™s regiment marched in the van of the clans, he and
Waverley, who now equalled any Highlander in the endurance of fatigue,
and was become somewhat acquainted with their language, were perpetually
at its head. They marked the progress of the army, however, with very
different eyes. Fergus, all air and fire, and confident against the world
in arms, measured nothing but that every step was a yard nearer London.
He neither asked, expected, nor desired any aid except that of the clans
to place the Stuarts once more on the throne; and when by chance a few
adherents joined the standard, he always considered them in the light of
new claimants upon the favours of the future monarch, who, he concluded,
must therefore subtract for their gratification so much of the bounty
which ought to be shared among his Highland followers.

Edwardâ€™s views were very different. He could not but observe that in
those towns in which they proclaimed James the Third, â€˜no man cried, God
bless him.â€™ The mob stared and listened, heartless, stupefied, and dull,
but gave few signs even of that boisterous spirit which induces them to
shout upon all occasions for the mere exercise of their most sweet
voices. The Jacobites had been taught to believe that the north-western
counties abounded with wealthy squires and hardy yeomen, devoted to the
cause of the White Rose. But of the wealthier Tories they saw little.
Some fled from their houses, some feigned themselves sick, some
surrendered themselves to the government as suspected persons. Of such as
remained, the ignorant gazed with astonishment, mixed with horror and
aversion, at the wild appearance, unknown language, and singular garb of
the Scottish clans. And to the more prudent their scanty numbers,
apparent deficiency in discipline, and poverty of equipment seemed
certain tokens of the calamitous termination of their rash undertaking.
Thus the few who joined them were such as bigotry of political principle
blinded to consequences, or whose broken fortunes induced them to hazard
all on a risk so desperate.

The Baron of Bradwardine, being asked what he thought of these recruits,
took a long pinch of snuff, and answered drily, â€˜that he could not but
have an excellent opinion of them, since they resembled precisely the
followers who attached themselves to the good King David at the cave of
Adullam--videlicet, every one that was in distress, and every one that
was in debt, and every one that was discontented, which the vulgate
renders bitter of soul; and doubtless,â€™ he said, â€˜they will prove mighty
men of their hands, and there is much need that they should, for I have
seen many a sour look cast upon us.â€™

But none of these considerations moved Fergus. He admired the luxuriant
beauty of the country, and the situation of many of the seats which they
passed. â€˜Is Waverley-Honour like that house, Edward?â€™

â€˜It is one-half larger.â€™

â€˜Is your uncleâ€™s park as fine a one as that?â€™

â€˜It is three times as extensive, and rather resembles a forest than a
mere park.â€™

â€˜Flora will be a happy woman.â€™

â€˜I hope Miss Mac-Ivor will have much reason for happiness unconnected
with Waverley-Honour.â€™

â€˜I hope so too; but to be mistress of such a place will be a pretty
addition to the sum total.â€™

â€˜An addition, the want of which, I trust, will be amply supplied by some
other means.â€™

â€˜How,â€™ said Fergus, stopping short and turning upon Waverley--â€˜how am I
to understand that, Mr. Waverley? Had I the pleasure to hear you aright?â€™

â€˜Perfectly right, Fergus.â€™

â€˜And am I to understand that you no longer desire my alliance and my
sisterâ€™s hand?â€™

â€˜Your sister has refused mine,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜both directly and by all
the usual means by which ladies repress undesired attentions.â€™

â€˜I have no idea,â€™ answered the Chieftain, â€˜of a lady dismissing or a
gentleman withdrawing his suit, after it has been approved of by her
legal guardian, without giving him an opportunity of talking the matter
over with the lady. You did not, I suppose, expect my sister to drop into
your mouth like a ripe plum the first moment you chose to open it?â€™

â€˜As to the ladyâ€™s title to dismiss her lover, Colonel,â€™ replied Edward,
â€˜it is a point which you must argue with her, as I am ignorant of the
customs of the Highlands in that particular. But as to my title to
acquiesce in a rejection from her without an appeal to your interest, I
will tell you plainly, without meaning to undervalue Miss Mac-Ivorâ€™s
admitted beauty and accomplishments, that I would not take the hand of an
angel, with an empire for her dowry, if her consent were extorted by the
importunity of friends and guardians, and did not flow from her own free
inclination.â€™

â€˜An angel, with the dowry of an empire,â€™ repeated Fergus, in a tone of
bitter irony, â€˜is not very likely to be pressed upon a ----shire squire.
But, sir,â€™ changing his tone, â€˜if Flora Mac-Ivor have not the dowry of an
empire, she is MY sister; and that is sufficient at least to secure her
against being treated with anything approaching to levity.â€™

â€˜She is Flora Mac-Ivor, sir,â€™ said Waverley, with firmness, â€˜which to me,
were I capable of treating ANY woman with levity, would be a more
effectual protection.â€™

The brow of the Chieftain was now fully clouded; but Edward felt too
indignant at the unreasonable tone which he had adopted to avert the
storm by the least concession. They both stood still while this short
dialogue passed, and Fergus seemed half disposed to say something more
violent, but, by a strong effort, suppressed his passion, and, turning
his face forward, walked sullenly on. As they had always hitherto walked
together, and almost constantly side by side, Waverley pursued his course
silently in the same direction, determined to let the Chief take his own
time in recovering the good-humour which he had so unreasonably
discarded, and firm in his resolution not to bate him an inch of dignity.

After they had marched on in this sullen manner about a mile, Fergus
resumed the discourse in a different tone. â€˜I believe I was warm, my dear
Edward, but you provoke me with your want of knowledge of the world. You
have taken pet at some of Floraâ€™s prudery, or high-flying notions of
loyalty, and now, like a child, you quarrel with the plaything you have
been crying for, and beat me, your faithful keeper, because my arm cannot
reach to Edinburgh to hand it to you. I am sure, if I was passionate, the
mortification of losing the alliance of such a friend, after your
arrangement had been the talk of both Highlands and Lowlands, and that
without so much as knowing why or wherefore, might well provoke calmer
blood than mine. I shall write to Edinburgh and put all to rights; that
is, if you desire I should do so; as indeed I cannot suppose that your
good opinion of Flora, it being such as you have often expressed to me,
can be at once laid aside.â€™

â€˜Colonel Mac-Ivor,â€™ said Edward, who had no mind to be hurried farther or
faster than he chose in a matter which he had already considered as
broken off, â€˜I am fully sensible of the value of your good offices; and
certainly, by your zeal on my behalf in such an affair, you do me no
small honour. But as Miss Mac-Ivor has made her election freely and
voluntarily, and as all my attentions in Edinburgh were received with
more than coldness, I cannot, in justice either to her or myself, consent
that she should again be harassed upon this topic. I would have mentioned
this to you some time since, but you saw the footing upon which we stood
together, and must have understood it. Had I thought otherwise I would
have earlier spoken; but I had a natural reluctance to enter upon a
subject so painful to us both.â€™

â€˜O, very well, Mr. Waverley,â€™ said Fergus, haughtily, â€˜the thing is at an
end. I have no occasion to press my sister upon any man.â€™

â€˜Nor have I any occasion to court repeated rejection from the same young
lady,â€™ answered Edward, in the same tone.

â€˜I shall make due inquiry, however,â€™ said the Chieftain, without noticing
the interruption, â€˜and learn what my sister thinks of all this, we will
then see whether it is to end here.â€™

â€˜Respecting such inquiries, you will of course be guided by your own
judgment,â€™ said Waverley. â€˜It is, I am aware, impossible Miss Mac-Ivor
can change her mind; and were such an unsupposable case to happen, it is
certain I will not change mine. I only mention this to prevent any
possibility of future misconstruction.â€™

Gladly at this moment would Mac-Ivor have put their quarrel to a personal
arbitrement, his eye flashed fire, and he measured Edward as if to choose
where he might best plant a mortal wound. But although we do not now
quarrel according to the modes and figures of Caranza or Vincent Saviola,
no one knew better than Fergus that there must be some decent pretext for
a mortal duel. For instance, you may challenge a man for treading on your
corn in a crowd, or for pushing you up to the wall, or for taking your
seat in the theatre; but the modern code of honour will not permit you to
found a quarrel upon your right of compelling a man to continue addresses
to a female relative which the fair lady has already refused. So that
Fergus was compelled to stomach this supposed affront until the whirligig
of time, whose motion he promised himself he would watch most sedulously,
should bring about an opportunity of revenge.

Waverleyâ€™s servant always led a saddle-horse for him in the rear of the
battalion to which he was attached, though his master seldom rode. But
now, incensed at the domineering and unreasonable conduct of his late
friend, he fell behind the column and mounted his horse, resolving to
seek the Baron of Bradwardine, and request permission to volunteer in his
troop instead of the Mac-Ivor regiment.

â€˜A happy time of it I should have had,â€™ thought he, after he was mounted,
â€˜to have been so closely allied to this superb specimen of pride and
self-opinion and passion. A colonel! why, he should have been a
generalissimo. A petty chief of three or four hundred men! his pride
might suffice for the Cham of Tartary--the Grand Seignior--the Great
Mogul! I am well free of him. Were Flora an angel, she would bring with
her a second Lucifer of ambition and wrath for a brother-in-law.â€™

The Baron, whose learning (like Sanchoâ€™s jests while in the Sierra
Morena) seemed to grow mouldy for want of exercise, joyfully embraced the
opportunity of Waverleyâ€™s offering his service in his regiment, to bring
it into some exertion. The good-natured old gentleman, however, laboured
to effect a reconciliation between the two quondam friends. Fergus turned
a cold ear to his remonstrances, though he gave them a respectful
hearing; and as for Waverley, he saw no reason why he should be the first
in courting a renewal of the intimacy which the Chieftain had so
unreasonably disturbed. The Baron then mentioned the matter to the
Prince, who, anxious to prevent quarrels in his little army, declared he
would himself remonstrate with Colonel Mac-Ivor on the unreasonableness
of his conduct. But, in the hurry of their march, it was a day or two
before he had an opportunity to exert his influence in the manner
proposed.

In the meanwhile Waverley turned the instructions he had received while
in Gardinerâ€™s dragoons to some account, and assisted the Baron in his
command as a sort of adjutant. â€˜Parmi les aveugles un borgne est roi,â€™
says the French proverb; and the cavalry, which consisted chiefly of
Lowland gentlemen, their tenants and servants, formed a high opinion of
Waverleyâ€™s skill and a great attachment to his person. This was indeed
partly owing to the satisfaction which they felt at the distinguished
English volunteerâ€™s leaving the Highlanders to rank among them; for there
was a latent grudge between the horse and foot, not only owing to the
difference of the services, but because most of the gentlemen, living
near the Highlands, had at one time or other had quarrels with the tribes
in their vicinity, and all of them looked with a jealous eye on the
Highlandersâ€™ avowed pretensions to superior valour and utility in the
Princeâ€™s service.




CHAPTER XXIX

THE CONFUSION OF KING AGRAMANTâ€™S CAMP


It was Waverleyâ€™s custom sometimes to ride a little apartride a little apart from the main
body, to look at any object of curiosity which occurred on the march.
They were now in Lancashire, when, attracted by a castellated old hall,
he left the squadron for half an hour to take a survey and slight sketch
of it. As he returned down the avenue he was met by Ensign Maccombich.
This man had contracted a sort of regard for Edward since the day of his
first seeing him at Tully-Veolan and introducing him to the Highlands. He
seemed to loiter, as if on purpose to meet with our hero. Yet, as he
passed him, he only approached his stirrup and pronounced the single word
â€˜Beware!â€™ and then walked swiftly on, shunning all further communication.

Edward, somewhat surprised at this hint, followed with his eyes the
course of Evan, who speedily disappeared among the trees. His servant,
Alick Polwarth, who was in attendance, also looked after the Highlander,
and then riding up close to his master, said,--

â€˜The neâ€™er be in me, sir, if I think youâ€™re safe amang thae Highland
rinthereouts.â€™

â€˜What do you mean, Alick?â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜The Mac-Ivors, sir, hae gotten it into their heads that ye hae affronted
their young leddy, Miss Flora; and I hae heard mae than ane say, they
wadna tak muckle to mak a black-cock oâ€™ ye; and ye ken weel eneugh
thereâ€™s mony oâ€™ them wadna mind a bawbee the weising a ball through the
Prince himsell, an the Chief gae them the wink, or whether he did or no,
if they thought it a thing that would please him when it was dune.â€™

Waverley, though confident that Fergus Mac-Ivor was incapable of such
treachery, was by no means equally sure of the forbearance of his
followers. He knew that, where the honour of the Chief or his family was
supposed to be touched, the happiest man would be he that could first
avenge the stigma; and he had often heard them quote a proverb, â€˜That the
best revenge was the most speedy and most safe.â€™ Coupling this with the
hint of Evan, he judged it most prudent to set spurs to his horse and
ride briskly back to the squadron. Ere he reached the end of the long
avenue, however, a ball whistled past him, and the report of a pistol was
heard.

â€˜It was that deevilâ€™s buckle, Callum Beg,â€™ said Alick; â€˜I saw him whisk
away through amang the reises.â€™

Edward, justly incensed at this act of treachery, galloped out of the
avenue, and observed the battalion of Mac-Ivor at some distance moving
along the common in which it terminated. He also saw an individual
running very fast to join the party; this he concluded was the intended
assassin, who, by leaping an enclosure, might easily make a much shorter
path to the main body than he could find on horseback. Unable to contain
himself, he commanded Alick to go to the Baron of Bradwardine, who was at
the head of his regiment about half a mile in front, and acquaint him
with what had happened. He himself immediately rode up to Fergusâ€™s
regiment. The Chief himself was in the act of joining them. He was on
horseback, having returned from waiting on the Prince. On perceiving
Edward approaching, he put his horse in motion towards him.

â€˜Colonel Mac-Ivor,â€™ said Waverley, without any farther salutation, â€˜I
have to inform you that one of your people has this instant fired at me
from a lurking-place.â€™

â€˜As that,â€™ answered Mac-Ivor, â€˜excepting the circumstance of a
lurking-place, is a pleasure which I presently propose to myself, I
should be glad to know which of my clansmen dared to anticipate me.â€™

â€˜I shall certainly be at your command whenever you please; the gentleman
who took your office upon himself is your page there, Callum Beg.â€™

â€˜Stand forth from the ranks, Callum! Did you fire at Mr. Waverley?â€™

â€˜No,â€™ answered the unblushing Callum.

â€˜You did,â€™ said Alick Polwarth, who was already returned, having met a
trooper by whom he despatched an account of what was going forward to the
Baron of Bradwardine, while he himself returned to his master at full
gallop, neither sparing the rowels of his spurs nor the sides of his
horse. â€˜You did; I saw you as plainly as I ever saw the auld kirk at
Coudingham.â€™

â€˜You lie,â€™ replied Callum, with his usual impenetrable obstinacy. The
combat between the knights would certainly, as in the days of chivalry,
have been preceded by an encounter between the squires (for Alick was a
stout-hearted Merseman, and feared the bow of Cupid far more than a
Highlanderâ€™s dirk or claymore), but Fergus, with his usual tone of
decision, demanded Callumâ€™s pistol. The cock was down, the pan and muzzle
were black with the smoke; it had been that instant fired.

â€˜Take that,â€™ said Fergus, striking the boy upon the head with the heavy
pistol-butt with his whole force--â€˜take that for acting without orders,
and lying to disguise it.â€™ Callum received the blow without appearing to
flinch from it, and fell without sign of life. â€˜Stand still, upon your
lives!â€™ said Fergus to the rest of the clan; â€˜I blow out the brains of
the first man who interferes between Mr. Waverley and me.â€™ They stood
motionless; Evan Dhu alone showed symptoms of vexation and anxiety.
Callum lay on the ground bleeding copiously, but no one ventured to give
him any assistance. It seemed as if he had gotten his death-blow.

â€˜And now for you, Mr. Waverley; please to turn your horse twenty yards
with me upon the common.â€™ Waverley complied; and Fergus, confronting him
when they were a little way from the line of march, said, with great
affected coolness, â€˜I could not but wonder, sir, at the fickleness of
taste which you were pleased to express the other day. But it was not an
angel, as you justly observed, who had charms for you, unless she brought
an empire for her fortune. I have now an excellent commentary upon that
obscure text.â€™

â€˜I am at a loss even to guess at your meaning, Colonel Mac-Ivor, unless
it seems plain that you intend to fasten a quarrel upon me.â€™

â€˜Your affected ignorance shall not serve you, sir. The Prince--the Prince
himself has acquainted me with your manoeuvres. I little thought that
your engagements with Miss Bradwardine were the reason of your breaking
off your intended match with my sister. I suppose the information that
the Baron had altered the destination of his estate was quite a
sufficient reason for slighting your friendâ€™s sister and carrying off
your friendâ€™s mistress.â€™

â€˜Did the Prince tell you I was engaged to Miss Bradwardine?â€™ said
Waverley. â€˜Impossible.â€™

â€˜He did, sir,â€™ answered Mac-Ivor; â€˜so, either draw and defend yourself or
resign your pretensions to the lady.â€™ â€˜This is absolute madness,â€™
exclaimed Waverley, â€˜or some strange mistake!â€™

â€˜O! no evasion! draw your sword!â€™ said the infuriated Chieftain, his own
already unsheathed.

â€˜Must I fight in a madmanâ€™s quarrel?â€™

â€˜Then give up now, and forever, all pretensions to Miss Bradwardineâ€™s
hand.â€™

â€˜What title have you,â€™ cried Waverley, utterly losing command of
himself--â€˜what title have you, or any man living, to dictate such terms
to me?â€™ And he also drew his sword.

At this moment the Baron of Bradwardine, followed by several of his
troop, came up on the spur, some from curiosity, others to take part in
the quarrel which they indistinctly understood had broken out between the
Mac-Ivors and their corps. The clan, seeing them approach, put themselves
in motion to support their Chieftain, and a scene of confusion commenced
which seamed likely to terminate in bloodshed. A hundred tongues were in
motion at once. The Baron lectured, the Chieftain stormed, the
Highlanders screamed in Gaelic, the horsemen cursed and swore in Lowland
Scotch. At length matters came to such a pass that the Baron threatened
to charge the Mac-Ivors unless they resumed their ranks, and many of
them, in return, presented their firearms at him and the other troopers.
The confusion was privately fostered by old Ballenkeiroch, who made no
doubt that his own day of vengeance was arrived, when, behold! a cry
arose of â€˜Room! make way! place a Monseigneur! place a Monseigneur!â€™ This
announced the approach of the Prince, who came up with a party of
Fitz-Jamesâ€™s foreign dragoons that acted as his body-guard. His arrival
produced some degree of order. The Highlanders reassumed their ranks, the
cavalry fell in and formed squadron, and the Baron and Chieftain were
silent.

The Prince called them and Waverley before him. Having heard the original
cause of the quarrel through the villainy of Callum Beg, he ordered him
into custody of the provost-marshal for immediate execution, in the event
of his surviving the chastisement inflicted by his Chieftain. Fergus,
however, in a tone betwixt claiming a right and asking a favour,
requested he might be left to his disposal, and promised his punishment
should be exemplary. To deny this might have seemed to encroach on the
patriarchal authority of the Chieftains, of which they were very jealous,
and they were not persons to be disobliged. Callum was therefore left to
the justice of his own tribe.

The Prince next demanded to know the new cause of quarrel between Colonel
Mac-Ivor and Waverley. There was a pause. Both gentlemen found the
presence of the Baron of Bradwardine (for by this time all three had
approached the Chevalier by his command) an insurmountable barrier
against entering upon a subject where the name of his daughter must
unavoidably be mentioned. They turned their eyes on the ground, with
looks in which shame and embarrassment were mingled with displeasure. The
Prince, who had been educated amongst the discontented and mutinous
spirits of the court of St. Germains, where feuds of every kind were the
daily subject of solicitude to the dethroned sovereign, had served his
apprenticeship, as old Frederick of Prussia would have said, to the trade
of royalty. To promote or restore concord among his followers was
indispensable. Accordingly he took his measures.

â€˜Monsieur de Beaujeu!â€™

â€˜Monseigneur!â€™ said a very handsome French cavalry officer who was in
attendance.

â€˜Ayez la bonte dâ€™aligner ces montagnards la, ainsi que la cavalerie, sâ€™il
vous plait, et de les remettre a la marche. Vous parlez si bien
lâ€™Anglois, cela ne vous donneroit pas beaucoup de peine.â€™

â€˜Ah! pas du tout, Monseigneur,â€™ replied Mons. le Comte de Beaujeu, his
head bending down to the neck of his little prancing highly-managed
charger. Accordingly he piaffed away, in high spirits and confidence, to
the head of Fergusâ€™s regiment, although understanding not a word of
Gaelic and very little English.

â€˜Messieurs les sauvages Ecossois--dat is, gentilmans savages, have the
goodness dâ€™arranger vous.â€™

The clan, comprehending the order more from the gesture than the words,
and seeing the Prince himself present, hastened to dress their ranks.

â€˜Ah! ver well! dat is fort bien!â€™ said the Count de Beaujeu. â€˜Gentilmans
sauvages! mais, tres bien. Eh bien! Quâ€™est ce que vous appelez visage,
Monsieur?â€™ (to a lounging trooper who stood by him). â€˜Ah, oui! face. Je
vous remercie, Monsieur. Gentilshommes, have de goodness to make de face
to de right par file, dat is, by files. Marsh! Mais, tres bien; encore,
Messieurs; il faut vous mettre a la marche. ... Marchez done, au nom de
Dieu, parceque jâ€™ai oublie le mot Anglois; mais vous etes des braves
gens, et me comprenez tres bien.â€™

The Count next hastened to put the cavalry in motion. â€˜Gentilmans
cavalry, you must fall in. Ah! par ma foi, I did not say fall off! I am a
fear de little gross fat gentilman is moche hurt. Ah, mon Dieu! câ€™est le
Commissaire qui nous a apporte les premieres nouvelles de ce maudit
fracas. Je suis trop fache, Monsieur!â€™

But poor Macwheeble, who, with a sword stuck across him, and a white
cockade as large as a pancake, now figured in the character of a
commissary, being overturned in the bustle occasioned by the troopers
hastening to get themselves in order in the Princeâ€™s presence, before he
could rally his galloway, slunk to the rear amid the unrestrained
laughter of the spectators.

â€˜Eh bien, Messieurs, wheel to de right. Ah! dat is it! Eh, Monsieur de
Bradwardine, ayez la bonte de vous mettre a la tete de votre regiment,
car, par Dieu, je nâ€™en puis plus!â€™

The Baron of Bradwardine was obliged to go to the assistance of Monsieur
de Beaujeu, after he had fairly expended his few English military
phrases. One purpose of the Chevalier was thus answered. The other he
proposed was, that in the eagerness to hear and comprehend commands
issued through such an indistinct medium in his own presence, the
thoughts of the soldiers in both corps might get a current different from
the angry channel in which they were flowing at the time.

Charles Edward was no sooner left with the Chieftain and Waverley, the
rest of his attendants being at some distance, than he said, â€˜If I owed
less to your disinterested friendship, I could be most seriously angry
with both of you for this very extraordinary and causeless broil, at a
moment when my fatherâ€™s service so decidedly demands the most perfect
unanimity. But the worst of my situation is, that my very best friends
hold they have liberty to ruin themselves, as well as the cause they are
engaged in, upon the slightest caprice.â€™

Both the young men protested their resolution to submit every difference
to his arbitration. â€˜Indeed,â€™ said Edward, â€˜I hardly know of what I am
accused. I sought Colonel Mac-Ivor merely to mention to him that I had
narrowly escaped assassination at the hand of his immediate dependent, a
dastardly revenge which I knew him to be incapable of authorising. As to
the cause for which he is disposed to fasten a quarrel upon me, I am
ignorant of it, unless it be that he accuses me, most unjustly, of having
engaged the affections of a young lady in prejudice of his pretensions.â€™

â€˜If there is an error,â€™ said the Chieftain, â€˜it arises from a
conversation which I held this morning with his Royal Highness himself.â€™

â€˜With me?â€™ said the Chevalier; â€˜how can Colonel Mac-Ivor have so far
misunderstood me?â€™

He then led Fergus aside, and, after five minutesâ€™ earnest conversation,
spurred his horse towards Edward. â€˜Is it possible--nay, ride up, Colonel,
for I desire no secrets--is it possible, Mr. Waverley, that I am mistaken
in supposing that you are an accepted lover of Miss Bradwardine? a fact
of which I was by circumstances, though not by communication from you, so
absolutely convinced that I alleged it to Vich Ian Vohr this morning as a
reason why, without offence to him, you might not continue to be
ambitious of an alliance which, to an unengaged person, even though once
repulsed, holds out too many charms to be lightly laid aside.â€™

â€˜Your Royal Highness,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜must have founded on circumstances
altogether unknown to me, when you did me the distinguished honour of
supposing me an accepted lover of Miss Bradwardine. I feel the
distinction implied in the supposition, but I have no title to it. For
the rest, my confidence in my own merit is too justly slight to admit of
my hoping for success in any quarter after positive rejection.â€™

The Chevalier was silent for a moment, looking steadily at them both, and
then said, â€˜Upon my word, Mr. Waverley, you are a less happy man than I
conceived I had very good reason to believe you. But now, gentlemen,
allow me to be umpire in this matter, not as Prince Regent but as Charles
Stuart, a brother adventurer with you in the same gallant cause. Lay my
pretensions to be obeyed by you entirely out of view, and consider your
own honour, and how far it is well or becoming to give our enemies the
advantage and our friends the scandal of showing that, few as we are, we
are not united. And forgive me if I add, that the names of the ladies who
have been mentioned crave more respect from us all than to be made themes
of discord.â€™

He took Fergus a little apart and spoke to him very earnestly for two or
three minutes, and then returning to Waverley, said, â€˜I believe I have
satisfied Colonel Mac-Ivor that his resentment was founded upon a
misconception, to which, indeed, I myself gave rise; and I trust Mr.
Waverley is too generous to harbour any recollection of what is past when
I assure him that such is the case. You must state this matter properly
to your clan, Vich Ian Vohr, to prevent a recurrence of their precipitate
violence.â€™ Fergus bowed. â€˜And now, gentlemen, let me have the pleasure to
see you shake hands.â€™

They advanced coldly, and with measured steps, each apparently reluctant
to appear most forward in concession. They did, however, shake hands, and
parted, taking a respectful leave of the Chevalier.

Charles Edward [Footnote: See Note 12.] then rode to the head of the
Mac-Ivors, threw himself from his horse, begged a drink out of old
Ballenkeirochâ€™s cantine, and marched about half a mile along with them,
inquiring into the history and connexions of Sliochd nan Ivor, adroitly
using the few words of Gaelic he possessed, and affecting a great desire
to learn it more thoroughly. He then mounted his horse once more, and
galloped to the Baronâ€™s cavalry, which was in front, halted them, and
examined their accoutrements and state of discipline; took notice of the
principal gentlemen, and even of the cadets; inquired after their ladies,
and commended their horses; rode about an hour with the Baron of
Bradwardine, and endured three long stories about Field-Marshal the Duke
of Berwick.

â€˜Ah, Beaujeu, mon cher ami,â€™ said he, as he returned to his usual place
in the line of march, â€˜que mon metier de prince errant est ennuyant, par
fois. Mais, courage! câ€™est le grand jeu, apres tout.â€™




CHAPTER XXX

A SKIRMISH


The reader need hardly be reminded that, after a council of war held at
Derby on the 5th of December, the Highlanders relinquished their
desperate attempt to penetrate farther into England, and, greatly to the
dissatisfaction of their young and daring leader, positively determined
to return northward. They commenced their retreat accordingly, and, by
the extreme celerity of their movements, outstripped the motions of the
Duke of Cumberland, who now pursued them with a very large body of
cavalry.

This retreat was a virtual resignation of their towering hopes. None had
been so sanguine as Fergus Mac-Ivor; none, consequently, was so cruelly
mortified at the change of measures. He argued, or rather remonstrated,
with the utmost vehemence at the council of war; and, when his opinion
was rejected, shed tears of grief and indignation. From that moment his
whole manner was so much altered that he could scarcely have been
recognised for the same soaring and ardent spirit, for whom the whole
earth seemed too narrow but a week before. The retreat had continued for
several days, when Edward, to his surprise, early on the 12th of
December, received a visit from the Chieftain in his quarters, in a
hamlet about half-way between Shap and Penrith.

Having had no intercourse with the Chieftain since their rupture, Edward
waited with some anxiety an explanation of this unexpected visit; nor
could he help being surprised, and somewhat shocked, with the change in
his appearance. His eye had lost much of its fire; his cheek was hollow,
his voice was languid, even his gait seemed less firm and elastic than it
was wont; and his dress, to which he used to be particularly attentive,
was now carelessly flung about him. He invited Edward to walk out with
him by the little river in the vicinity; and smiled in a melancholy
manner when he observed him take down and buckle on his sword.

As soon as they were in a wild sequestered path by the side of the
stream, the Chief broke out--â€˜Our fine adventure is now totally ruined,
Waverley, and I wish to know what you intend to do;--nay, never stare at
me, man. I tell you I received a packet from my sister yesterday, and,
had I got the information it contains sooner, it would have prevented a
quarrel which I am always vexed when I think of. In a letter written
after our dispute, I acquainted her with the cause of it; and she now
replies to me that she never had, nor could have, any purpose of giving
you encouragement; so that it seems I have acted like a madman. Poor
Flora! she writes in high spirits; what a change will the news of this
unhappy retreat make in her state of mind!â€™





Waverley, who was really much affected by the deep tone of melancholy
with which Fergus spoke, affectionately entreated him to banish from his
remembrance any unkindness which had arisen between them, and they once
more shook hands, but now with sincere cordiality. Fergus again inquired
of Waverley what he intended to do. â€˜Had you not better leave this
luckless army, and get down before us into Scotland, and embark for the
Continent from some of the eastern ports that are still in our
possession? When you are out of the kingdom, your friends will easily
negotiate your pardon; and, to tell you the truth, I wish you would carry
Rose Bradwardine with you as your wife, and take Flora also under your
joint protection.â€™--Edward looked surprised.--â€˜She loves you, and I
believe you love her, though, perhaps, you have not found it out, for you
are not celebrated for knowing your own mind very pointedly.â€™ He said
this with a sort of smile.

â€˜How,â€™ answered Edward, â€˜can you advise me to desert the expedition in
which we are all embarked?â€™

â€˜Embarked?â€™ said Fergus; â€˜the vessel is going to pieces, and it is full
time for all who can to get into the long-boat and leave her.â€™

â€˜Why, what will other gentlemen do?â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜and why did the
Highland Chiefs consent to this retreat if it is so ruinous?â€™

â€˜O,â€™ replied Mac-Ivor, â€˜they think that, as on former occasions, the
heading, hanging, and forfeiting will chiefly fall to the lot of the
Lowland gentry; that they will be left secure in their poverty and their
fastnesses, there, according to their proverb, â€œto listen to the wind
upon the hill till the waters abate.â€ But they will be disappointed; they
have been too often troublesome to be so repeatedly passed over, and this
time John Bull has been too heartily frightened to recover his
good-humour for some time. The Hanoverian ministers always deserved to be
hanged for rascals; but now, if they get the power in their hands,--as,
sooner or later, they must, since there is neither rising in England nor
assistance from France,--they will deserve the gallows as fools if they
leave a single clan in the Highlands in a situation to be again
troublesome to government. Ay, they will make root-and-branch-work, I
warrant them.â€™

â€˜And while you recommend flight to me,â€™ said Edward,--â€˜a counsel which I
would rather die than embrace,--what are your own views?â€™

â€˜O,â€™ answered Fergus, with a melancholy air, â€˜my fate is settled. Dead or
captive I must be before tomorrow.â€™

â€˜What do you mean by that, my friend?â€™ said Edward. â€˜The enemy is still a
dayâ€™s march in our rear, and if he comes up, we are still strong enough
to keep him in check. Remember Gladsmuir.â€™

â€˜What I tell you is true notwithstanding, so far as I am individually
concerned.â€™

â€˜Upon what authority can you found so melancholy a prediction?â€™ asked
Waverley.

â€˜On one which never failed a person of my house. I have seen,â€™ he said,
lowering his voice, â€˜I have seen the Bodach Glas.â€™

â€˜Bodach Glas?â€™

â€˜Yes; have you been so long at Glennaquoich, and never heard of the Grey
Spectre? though indeed there is a certain reluctance among us to mention
him.â€™

â€˜No, never.â€™

â€˜Ah! it would have been a tale for poor Flora to have told you. Or, if
that hill were Benmore, and that long blue lake, which you see just
winding towards yon mountainous country, were Loch Tay, or my own Loch an
Ri, the tale would be better suited with scenery. However, let us sit
down on this knoll; even Saddleback and Ulswater will suit what I have to
say better than the English hedgerows, enclosures, and farmhouses. You
must know, then, that when my ancestor, Ian nan Chaistel, wasted
Northumberland, there was associated with him in the expedition a sort of
Southland Chief, or captain of a band of Lowlanders, called Halbert Hall.
In their return through the Cheviots they quarrelled about the division
of the great booty they had acquired, and came from words to blows. The
Lowlanders were cut off to a man, and their chief fell the last, covered
with wounds by the sword of my ancestor. Since that time his spirit has
crossed the Vich Ian Vohr of the day when any great disaster was
impending, but especially before approaching death. My father saw him
twice, once before he was made prisoner at Sheriff-Muir, another time on
the morning of the day on which he died.â€™

â€˜How can you, my dear Fergus, tell such nonsense with a grave face?â€™

â€˜I do not ask you to believe it; but I tell you the truth, ascertained
by three hundred yearsâ€™ experience at least, and last night by my own
eyes.â€™

â€˜The particulars, for heavenâ€™s sake!â€™ said Waverley, with eagerness.

â€˜I will, on condition you will not attempt a jest on the subject. Since
this unhappy retreat commenced I have scarce ever been able to sleep for
thinking of my clan, and of this poor Prince, whom they are leading back
like a dog in a string, whether he will or no, and of the downfall of my
family. Last night I felt so feverish that I left my quarters and walked
out, in hopes the keen frosty air would brace my nerves--I cannot tell
how much I dislike going on, for I know you will hardly believe me.
However--I crossed a small footbridge, and kept walking backwards and
forwards, when I observed with surprise by the clear moonlight a tall
figure in a grey plaid, such as shepherds wear in the south of Scotland,
which, move at what pace I would, kept regularly about four yards before
me.â€™

â€˜You saw a Cumberland peasant in his ordinary dress, probably.â€™

â€˜No; I thought so at first, and was astonished at the manâ€™s audacity in
daring to dog me. I called to him, but received no answer. I felt an
anxious throbbing at my heart, and to ascertain what I dreaded, I stood
still and turned myself on the same spot successively to the four points
of the compass. By Heaven, Edward, turn where I would, the figure was
instantly before my eyes, at precisely the same distance! I was then
convinced it was the Bodach Glas. My hair bristled and my knees shook. I
manned myself, however, and determined to return to my quarters. My
ghastly visitant glided before me (for I cannot say he walked) until he
reached the footbridge; there he stopped and turned full round. I must
either wade the river or pass him as close as I am to you. A desperate
courage, founded on the belief that my death was near, made me resolve to
make my way in despite of him. I made the sign of the cross, drew my
sword, and uttered, â€œIn the name of God, Evil Spirit, give place!â€ â€œVich
Ian Vohr,â€ it said, in a voice that made my very blood curdle, â€œbeware of
to-morrow!â€ It seemed at that moment not half a yard from my swordâ€™s
point; but the words were no sooner spoken than it was gone, and nothing
appeared further to obstruct my passage. I got home and threw myself on
my bed, where I spent a few hours heavily enough; and this morning, as no
enemy was reported to be near us, I took my horse and rode forward to
make up matters with you. I would not willingly fall until I am in
charity with a wronged friend.â€™

Edward had little doubt that this phantom was the operation of an
exhausted frame and depressed spirits, working on the belief common to
all Highlanders in such superstitions. He did not the less pity Fergus,
for whom, in his present distress, he felt all his former regard revive.
With the view of diverting his mind from these gloomy images, he offered,
with the Baronâ€™s permission, which he knew he could readily obtain, to
remain in his quarters till Fergusâ€™s corps should come up, and then to
march with them as usual. The Chief seemed much pleased, yet hesitated to
accept the offer.

â€˜We are, you know, in the rear, the post of danger in a retreat.â€™

â€˜And therefore the post of honour.â€™

â€˜Well,â€™ replied the Chieftain, â€˜let Alick have your horse in readiness,
in case we should be overmatched, and I shall be delighted to have your
company once more.â€™

The rear-guard were late in making their appearance, having been delayed
by various accidents and by the badness of the roads. At length they
entered the hamlet. When Waverley joined the clan Mac-Ivor, arm-in-arm
with their Chieftain, all the resentment they had entertained against him
seemed blown off at once. Evan Dhu received him with a grin of
congratulation; and even Callum, who was running about as active as ever,
pale indeed, and with a great patch on his head, appeared delighted to
see him.

â€˜That gallows-birdâ€™s skull,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜must be harder than marble;
the lock of the pistol was actually broken.â€™

â€˜How could you strike so young a lad so hard?â€™ said Waverley, with some
interest.

â€˜Why, if I did not strike hard sometimes, the rascals would forget
themselves.â€™

They were now in full march, every caution being taken to prevent
surprise. Fergusâ€™s people, and a fine clan regiment from Badenoch,
commanded by Cluny Mac-Pherson, had the rear. They had passed a large
open moor, and were entering into the enclosures which surround a small
village called Clifton. The winter sun had set, and Edward began to rally
Fergus upon the false predictions of the Grey Spirit. â€˜The ides of March
are not past,â€™ said Mac-Ivor, with a smile; when, suddenly casting his
eyes back on the moor, a large body of cavalry was indistinctly seen to
hover upon its brown and dark surface. To line the enclosures facing the
open ground and the road by which the enemy must move from it upon the
village was the work of a short time. While these manoeuvres were
accomplishing, night sunk down, dark and gloomy, though the moon was at
full. Sometimes, however, she gleamed forth a dubious light upon the
scene of action.

The Highlanders did not long remain undisturbed in the defensive position
they had adopted. Favoured by the night, one large body of dismounted
dragoons attempted to force the enclosures, while another, equally
strong, strove to penetrate by the highroad. Both were received by such a
heavy fire as disconcerted their ranks and effectually checked their
progress. Unsatisfied with the advantage thus gained, Fergus, to whose
ardent spirit the approach of danger seemed to restore all its
elasticity, drawing his sword and calling out â€˜Claymore!â€™ encouraged his
men, by voice and example, to break through the hedge which divided them
and rush down upon the enemy. Mingling with the dismounted dragoons, they
forced them, at the sword-point, to fly to the open moor, where a
considerable number were cut to pieces. But the moon, which suddenly
shone out, showed to the English the small number of assailants,
disordered by their own success. Two squadrons of horse moving to the
support of their companions, the Highlanders endeavoured to recover the
enclosures. But several of them, amongst others their brave Chieftain,
were cut off and surrounded before they could effect their purpose.
Waverley, looking eagerly for Fergus, from whom, as well as from the
retreating body of his followers, he had been separated in the darkness
and tumult, saw him, with Evan Dhu and Callum, defending themselves
desperately against a dozen of horsemen, who were hewing at them with
their long broadswords. The moon was again at that moment totally
overclouded, and Edward, in the obscurity, could neither bring aid to his
friends nor discover which way lay his own road to rejoin the rear-guard.
After once or twice narrowly escaping being slain or made prisoner by
parties of the cavalry whom he encountered in the darkness, he at length
reached an enclosure, and, clambering over it, concluded himself in
safety and on the way to the Highland forces, whose pipes he heard at
some distance. For Fergus hardly a hope remained, unless that he might be
made prisoner. Revolving his fate with sorrow and anxiety, the
superstition of the Bodach Glas recurred to Edwardâ€™s recollection, and he
said to himself, with internal surprise â€˜What, can the devil speak
truth?â€™ [Footnote: See Note 13.]




CHAPTER XXXI

CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS


Edward was in a most unpleasant and dangerous situation. He soon lost the
sound of the bagpipes; and, what was yet more unpleasant, when, after
searching long in vain and scrambling through many enclosures, he at
length approached the highroad, he learned, from the unwelcome noise of
kettledrums and trumpets, that the English cavalry now occupied it, and
consequently were between him and the Highlanders. Precluded, therefore,
from advancing in a straight direction, he resolved to avoid the English
military and endeavour to join his friends by making a circuit to the
left, for which a beaten path, deviating from the main road in that
direction, seemed to afford facilities. The path was muddy and the night
dark and cold; but even these inconveniences were hardly felt amidst the
apprehensions which falling into the hands of the Kingâ€™s forces
reasonably excited in his bosom.

After walking about three miles, he at length reached a hamlet. Conscious
that the common people were in general unfavourable to the cause he had
espoused, yet desirous, if possible, to procure a horse and guide to
Penrith, where he hoped to find the rear, if not the main body, of the
Chevalierâ€™s army, he approached the alehouse of the place. There was a
great noise within; he paused to listen. A round English oath or two, and
the burden of a campaign song, convinced him the hamlet also was occupied
by the Duke of Cumberlandâ€™s soldiers. Endeavouring to retire from it as
softly as possible, and blessing the obscurity which hitherto he had
murmured against, Waverley groped his way the best he could along a small
paling, which seemed the boundary of some cottage garden. As he reached
the gate of this little enclosure, his outstretched hand was grasped by
that of a female, whose voice at the same time uttered, â€˜Edward, isâ€™t
thou, man?â€™

â€˜Here is some unlucky mistake,â€™ thought Edward, struggling, but gently,
to disengage himself.

â€˜Naen oâ€™ thy foun, now, man, or the red cwoats will hear thee; they hae
been houlerying and poulerying every ane that past alehouse door this
noight to make them drive their waggons and sick loike. Come into
feytherâ€™s, or theyâ€™ll do ho a mischief.â€™

â€˜A good hint,â€™ thought Waverley, following the girl through the little
garden into a brick-paved kitchen, where she set herself to kindle a
match at an expiring fire, and with the match to light a candle. She had
no sooner looked on Edward than she dropped the light, with a shrill
scream of â€˜O feyther, feyther!â€™

The father, thus invoked, speedily appeared--a sturdy old farmer, in a
pair of leather breeches, and boots pulled on without stockings, having
just started from his bed; the rest of his dress was only a Westmoreland
statesmanâ€™s robe-de-chambre--that is, his shirt. His figure was displayed
to advantage by a candle which he bore in his left hand; in his right he
brandished a poker.

â€˜What hast ho here, wench?â€™

â€˜O!â€™ cried the poor girl, almost going off in hysterics, â€˜I thought it
was Ned Williams, and it is one of the plaid-men.â€™

â€˜And what was thee ganging to do wiâ€™ Ned Williams at this time oâ€™
noight?â€™ To this, which was, perhaps, one of the numerous class of
questions more easily asked than answered, the rosy-cheeked damsel made
no reply, but continued sobbing and wringing her hands.

â€˜And thee, lad, dost ho know that the dragoons be a town? dost ho know
that, mon? ad, theyâ€™ll sliver thee loike a turnip, mon.â€™

â€˜I know my life is in great danger,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜but if you can
assist me, I will reward you handsomely. I am no Scotchman, but an
unfortunate English gentleman.â€™

â€˜Be ho Scot or no,â€™ said the honest farmer, â€˜I wish thou hadst kept the
other side of the hallan. But since thou art here, Jacob Jopson will
betray no manâ€™s bluid; and the plaids were gay canny, and did not do so
much mischief when they were here yesterday.â€™ Accordingly, he set
seriously about sheltering and refreshing our hero for the night. The
fire was speedily rekindled, but with precaution against its light being
seen from without. The jolly yeoman cut a rasher of bacon, which Cicely
soon broiled, and her father added a swingeing tankard of his best ale.
It was settled that Edward should remain there till the troops marched in
the morning, then hire or buy a horse from the farmer, and, with the best
directions that could be obtained, endeavour to overtake his friends. A
clean, though coarse, bed received him after the fatigues of this unhappy
day.

With the morning arrived the news that the Highlanders had evacuated
Penrith, and marched off towards Carlisle; that the Duke of Cumberland
was in possession of Penrith, and that detachments of his army covered
the roads in every direction. To attempt to get through undiscovered
would be an act of the most frantic temerity. Ned Williams (the right
Edward) was now called to council by Cicely and her father. Ned, who
perhaps did not care that his handsome namesake should remain too long in
the same house with his sweetheart, for fear of fresh mistakes, proposed
that Waverley, exchanging his uniform and plaid for the dress of the
country, should go with him to his fatherâ€™s farm near Ullswater, and
remain in that undisturbed retirement until the military movements in the
country should have ceased to render his departure hazardous. A price was
also agreed upon, at which the stranger might board with Farmer Williams
if he thought proper, till he could depart with safety. It was of
moderate amount; the distress of his situation, among this honest and
simple-hearted race, being considered as no reason for increasing their
demand.

The necessary articles of dress were accordingly procured, and, by
following by-paths known to the young farmer, they hoped to escape any
unpleasant rencontre. A recompense for their hospitality was refused
peremptorily by old Jopson and his cherry-cheeked daughter; a kiss paid
the one and a hearty shake of the hand the other. Both seemed anxious for
their guestâ€™s safety, and took leave of him with kind wishes.

In the course of their route Edward, with his guide, traversed those
fields which the night before had been the scene of action. A brief gleam
of Decemberâ€™s sun shone sadly on the broad heath, which, towards the spot
where the great north-west road entered the enclosures of Lord Lonsdaleâ€™s
property, exhibited dead bodies of men and horses, and the usual
companions of war, a number of carrion-crows, hawks, and ravens.

â€˜And this, then, was thy last field,â€™ said Waverley to himself, his eye
filling at the recollection of the many splendid points of Fergusâ€™s
character, and of their former intimacy, all his passions and
imperfections forgotten--â€˜here fell the last Vich Ian Vohr, on a nameless
heath; and in an obscure night-skirmish was quenched that ardent spirit,
who thought it little to cut a way for his master to the British throne!
Ambition, policy, bravery, all far beyond their sphere, here learned the
fate of mortals. The sole support, too, of a sister whose spirit, as
proud and unbending, was even more exalted than thine own; here ended all
thy hopes for Flora, and the long and valued line which it was thy boast
to raise yet more highly by thy adventurous valour!â€™

As these ideas pressed on Waverleyâ€™s mind, he resolved to go upon the
open heath and search if, among the slain, he could discover the body of
his friend, with the pious intention of procuring for him the last rites
of sepulture. The timorous young man who accompanied him remonstrated
upon the danger of the attempt, but Edward was determined. The followers
of the camp had already stripped the dead of all they could carry away;
but the country people, unused to scenes of blood, had not yet approached
the field of action, though some stood fearfully gazing at a distance.
About sixty or seventy dragoons lay slain within the first enclosure,
upon the highroad, and on the open moor. Of the Highlanders, not above a
dozen had fallen, chiefly those who, venturing too far on the moor, could
not regain the strong ground. He could not find the body of Fergus among
the slain. On a little knoll, separated from the others, lay the
carcasses of three English dragoons, two horses, and the page Callum Beg,
whose hard skull a trooperâ€™s broadsword had, at length, effectually
cloven. It was possible his clan had carried off the body of Fergus; but
it was also possible he had escaped, especially as Evan Dhu, who would
never leave his Chief, was not found among the dead; or he might be
prisoner, and the less formidable denunciation inferred from the
appearance of the Bodach Glas might have proved the true one. The
approach of a party sent for the purpose of compelling the country people
to bury the dead, and who had already assembled several peasants for that
purpose, now obliged Edward to rejoin his guide, who awaited him in great
anxiety and fear under shade of the plantations.

After leaving this field of death, the rest of their journey was happily
accomplished. At the house of Farmer Williams, Edward passed for a young
kinsman, educated for the church, who was come to reside there till the
civil tumults permitted him to pass through the country. This silenced
suspicion among the kind and simple yeomanry of Cumberland, and accounted
sufficiently for the grave manners and retired habits of the new guest.
The precaution became more necessary than Waverley had anticipated, as a
variety of incidents prolonged his stay at Fasthwaite, as the farm was
called.

A tremendous fall of snow rendered his departure impossible for more than
ten days. When the roads began to become a little practicable, they
successively received news of the retreat of the Chevalier into Scotland;
then, that he had abandoned the frontiers, retiring upon Glasgow; and
that the Duke of Cumberland had formed the siege of Carlisle. His army,
therefore, cut off all possibility of Waverleyâ€™s escaping into Scotland
in that direction. On the eastern border Marshal Wade, with a large
force, was advancing upon Edinburgh; and all along the frontier, parties
of militia, volunteers, and partizans were in arms to suppress
insurrection, and apprehend such stragglers from the Highland army as had
been left in England. The surrender of Carlisle, and the severity with
which the rebel garrison were threatened, soon formed an additional
reason against venturing upon a solitary and hopeless journey through a
hostile country and a large army, to carry the assistance of a single
sword to a cause which seemed altogether desperate. In this lonely and
secluded situation, without the advantage of company or conversation with
men of cultivated minds, the arguments of Colonel Talbot often recurred
to the mind of our hero. A still more anxious recollection haunted his
slumbers--it was the dying look and gesture of Colonel Gardiner. Most
devoutly did he hope, as the rarely occurring post brought news of
skirmishes with various success, that it might never again be his lot to
draw his sword in civil conflict. Then his mind turned to the supposed
death of Fergus, to the desolate situation of Flora, and, with yet more
tender recollection, to that of Rose Bradwardine, who was destitute of
the devoted enthusiasm of loyalty, which to her friend hallowed and
exalted misfortune. These reveries he was permitted to enjoy, undisturbed
by queries or interruption; and it was in many a winter walk by the
shores of Ullswater that he acquired a more complete mastery of a spirit
tamed by adversity than his former experience had given him; and that he
felt himself entitled to say firmly, though perhaps with a sigh, that the
romance of his life was ended, and that its real history had now
commenced. He was soon called upon to justify his pretensions by reason
and philosophy.




CHAPTER XXXII

A JOURNEY TO LONDON


The family at Fasthwaite were soon attached to Edward. He had, indeed, that
gentleness and urbanity which almost universally attracts corresponding
kindness; and to their simple ideas his learning gave him consequence,
and his sorrows interest. The last he ascribed, evasively, to the loss of
a brother in the skirmish near Clifton; and in that primitive state of
society, where the ties of affection were highly deemed of, his continued
depression excited sympathy, but not surprise.

In the end of January his more lively powers were called out by the happy
union of Edward Williams, the son of his host, with Cicely Jopson. Our
hero would not cloud with sorrow the festivity attending the wedding of
two persons to whom he was so highly obliged. He therefore exerted
himself, danced, sung, played at the various games of the day, and was
the blithest of the company. The next morning, however, he had more
serious matters to think of.

The clergyman who had married the young couple was so much pleased with
the supposed student of divinity, that he came next day from Penrith on
purpose to pay him a visit. This might have been a puzzling chapter had
he entered into any examination of our heroâ€™s supposed theological
studies; but fortunately he loved better to hear and communicate the news
of the day. He brought with him two or three old newspapers, in one of
which Edward found a piece of intelligence that soon rendered him deaf to
every word which the Reverend Mr. Twigtythe was saying upon the news from
the north, and the prospect of the Dukeâ€™s speedily overtaking and
crushing the rebels. This was an article in these, or nearly these
words:--

â€˜Died at his house, in Hill Street, Berkeley Square, upon the 10th inst.,
Richard Waverley, Esq., second son of Sir Giles Waverley of
Waverley-Honour, etc. etc. He died of a lingering disorder, augmented by
the unpleasant predicament of suspicion in which he stood, having been
obliged to find bail to a high amount to meet an impending accusation of
high-treason. An accusation of the same grave crime hangs over his elder
brother, Sir Everard Waverley, the representative of that ancient family;
and we understand the day of his trial will be fixed early in the next
month, unless Edward Waverley, son of the deceased Richard, and heir to
the Baronet, shall surrender himself to justice. In that case we are
assured it is his Majestyâ€™s gracious purpose to drop further proceedings
upon the charge against Sir Everard. This unfortunate young gentleman is
ascertained to have been in arms in the Pretenderâ€™s service, and to have
marched along with the Highland troops into England. But he has not been
heard of since the skirmish at Clifton, on the 18th December last.â€™

Such was this distracting paragraph. â€˜Good God!â€™ exclaimed Waverley, â€˜am
I then a parricide? Impossible! My father, who never showed the affection
of a father while he lived, cannot have been so much affected by my
supposed death as to hasten his own; no, I will not believe it, it were
distraction to entertain for a moment such a horrible idea. But it were,
if possible, worse than parricide to suffer any danger to hang over my
noble and generous uncle, who has ever been more to me than a father, if
such evil can be averted by any sacrifice on my part!â€™

While these reflections passed like the stings of scorpions through
Waverleyâ€™s sensorium, the worthy divine was startled in a long
disquisition on the battle of Falkirk by the ghastliness which they
communicated to his looks, and asked him if he was ill? Fortunately the
bride, all smirk and blush, had just entered the room. Mrs. Williams was
none of the brightest of women, but she was good-natured, and readily
concluding that Edward had been shocked by disagreeable news in the
papers, interfered so judiciously, that, without exciting suspicion, she
drew off Mr. Twigtytheâ€™s attention, and engaged it until he soon after
took his leave. Waverley then explained to his friends that he was under
the necessity of going to London with as little delay as possible.

One cause of delay, however, did occur, to which Waverley had been very
little accustomed. His purse, though well stocked when he first went to
Tully-Veolan, had not been reinforced since that period; and although his
life since had not been of a nature to exhaust it hastily, for he had
lived chiefly with his friends or with the army, yet he found that, after
settling with his kind landlord, he should be too poor to encounter the
expense of travelling post. The best course, therefore, seemed to be to
get into the great north road about Boroughbridge, and there take a place
in the northern diligence, a huge old-fashioned tub, drawn by three
horses, which completed the journey from Edinburgh to London (God
willing, as the advertisement expressed it) in three weeks. Our hero,
therefore, took an affectionate farewell of his Cumberland friends, whose
kindness he promised never to forget, and tacitly hoped one day to
acknowledge by substantial proofs of gratitude. After some petty
difficulties and vexatious delays, and after putting his dress into a
shape better befitting his rank, though perfectly plain and simple, he
accomplished crossing the country, and found himself in the desired
vehicle vis-a-vis to Mrs. Nosebag, the lady of Lieutenant Nosebag,
adjutant and riding-master of the--dragoons, a jolly woman of about
fifty, wearing a blue habit, faced with scarlet, and grasping a
silver-mounted horse-whip.

This lady was one of those active members of society who take upon them
faire le frais de la conversation. She had just returned from the north,
and informed Edward how nearly her regiment had cut the petticoat people
into ribands at Falkirk, â€˜only somehow there was one of those nasty,
awkward marshes, that they are never without in Scotland, I think, and so
our poor dear little regiment suffered something, as my Nosebag says, in
that unsatisfactory affair. You, sir, have served in the dragoons?â€™
Waverley was taken so much at unawares that he acquiesced.

â€˜O, I knew it at once; I saw you were military from your air, and I was
sure you could be none of the foot-wobblers, as my Nosebag calls them.
What regiment, pray?â€™ Here was a delightful question. Waverley, however,
justly concluded that this good lady had the whole army-list by heart;
and, to avoid detection by adhering to truth, answered, â€˜Gardinerâ€™s
dragoons, maâ€™am; but I have retired some time.â€™

â€˜O aye, those as won the race at the battle of Preston, as my Nosebag
says. Pray, sir, were you there?â€™

â€˜I was so unfortunate, madam,â€™ he replied, â€˜as to witness that
engagement.â€™

â€˜And that was a misfortune that few of Gardinerâ€™s stood to witness, I
believe, sir--ha! ha! ha! I beg your pardon; but a soldierâ€™s wife loves a
joke.â€™

â€˜Devil confound you,â€™ thought Waverley: â€˜what infernal luck has penned me
up with this inquisitive hag!â€™

Fortunately the good lady did not stick long to one subject. â€˜We are
coming to Ferrybridge now,â€™ she said, â€˜where there was a party of OURS
left to support the beadles, and constables, and justices, and these sort
of creatures that are examining papers and stopping rebels, and all
that.â€™ They were hardly in the inn before she dragged Waverley to the
window, exclaiming, â€˜Yonder comes Corporal Bridoon, of our poor dear
troop; heâ€™s coming with the constable man. Bridoonâ€™s one of my lambs, as
Nosebag calls â€˜ern. Come, Mr.--a--a--pray, whatâ€™s your name, sir?â€™

â€˜Butler, maâ€™am,â€™ said Waverley, resolved rather to make free with the
name of a former fellow-officer than run the risk of detection by
inventing one not to be found in the regiment.

â€˜O, you got a troop lately, when that shabby fellow, Waverley, went over
to the rebels? Lord, I wish our old cross Captain Crump would go over to
the rebels, that Nosebag might get the troop! Lord, what can Bridoon be
standing swinging on the bridge for? Iâ€™ll be hanged if he aâ€™nt hazy, as
Nosebag says. Come, sir, as you and I belong to the service, weâ€™ll go put
the rascal in mind of his duty.â€™

Waverley, with feelings more easily conceived than described, saw himself
obliged to follow this doughty female commander. The gallant trooper was
as like a lamb as a drunk corporal of dragoons, about six feet high, with
very broad shoulders, and very thin legs, not to mention a great scar
across his nose, could well be. Mrs. Nosebag addressed him with something
which, if not an oath, sounded very like one, and commanded him to attend
to his duty. â€˜You be d--d for a----,â€™ commenced the gallant cavalier;
but, looking up in order to suit the action to the words, and also to
enforce the epithet which he meditated with an adjective applicable to
the party, he recognised the speaker, made his military salaam, and
altered his tone. â€˜Lord love your handsome face, Madam Nosebag, is it
you? Why, if a poor fellow does happen to fire a slug of a morning, I am
sure you were never the lady to bring him to harm.â€™

â€˜Well, you rascallion, go, mind your duty; this gentleman and I belong to
the service; but be sure you look after that shy cock in the slouched hat
that sits in the corner of the coach. I believe heâ€™s one of the rebels in
disguise.â€™

â€˜D--n her gooseberry wig,â€™ said the corporal, when she was out of
hearing, â€˜that gimlet-eyed jade--mother adjutant, as we call her--is a
greater plague to the regiment than provost-marshal, sergeant-major, and
old Hubble-de-Shuff, the colonel, into the bargain. Come, Master
Constable, letâ€™s see if this shy cock, as she calls him (who, by the way,
was a Quaker from Leeds, with whom Mrs. Nosebag had had some tart
argument on the legality of bearing arms), will stand godfather to a sup
of brandy, for your Yorkshire ale is cold on my stomach.â€™

The vivacity of this good lady, as it helped Edward out of this scrape,
was like to have drawn him into one or two others. In every town where
they stopped she wished to examine the corps de garde, if there was one,
and once very narrowly missed introducing Waverley to a
recruiting-sergeant of his own regiment. Then she Captainâ€™d and Butlerâ€™d
him till he was almost mad with vexation and anxiety; and never was he
more rejoiced in his life at the termination of a journey than when the
arrival of the coach in London freed him from the attentions of Madam
Nosebag.




CHAPTER XXXIII

WHATâ€™S TO BE DONE NEXT?


It was twilight when they arrived in town; and having shaken off his
companions, and walked through a good many streets to avoid the
possibility of being traced by them, Edward took a hackney-coach and
drove to Colonel Talbotâ€™s house, in one of the principal squares at the
west end of the town. That gentleman, by the death of relations, had
succeeded since his marriage to a large fortune, possessed considerable
political interest, and lived in what is called great style.

When Waverley knocked at his door he found it at first difficult to
procure admittance, but at length was shown into an apartment where the
Colonel was at table. Lady Emily, whose very beautiful features were
still pallid from indisposition, sate opposite to him. The instant he
heard Waverleyâ€™s voice, he started up and embraced him. â€˜Frank Stanley,
my dear boy, how dâ€™ye do? Emily, my love, this is young Stanley.â€™

The blood started to the ladyâ€™s cheek as she gave Waverley a reception in
which courtesy was mingled with kindness, while her trembling hand and
faltering voice showed how much she was startled and discomposed. Dinner
was hastily replaced, and while Waverley was engaged in refreshing
himself, the Colonel proceeded--â€˜I wonder you have come here, Frank; the
Doctors tell me the air of London is very bad for your complaints. You
should not have risked it. But I am delighted to see you, and so is
Emily, though I fear we must not reckon upon your staying long.â€™

â€˜Some particular business brought me up,â€™ muttered Waverley.

â€˜I supposed so, but I shanâ€™t allow you to stay long. Spontoonâ€™ (to an
elderly military-looking servant out of livery), â€˜take away these things,
and answer the bell yourself, if I ring. Donâ€™t let any of the other
fellows disturb us. My nephew and I have business to talk of.â€™

When the servants had retired, â€˜In the name of God, Waverley, what has
brought you here? It may be as much as your life is worth.â€™

â€˜Dear Mr. Waverley,â€™ said Lady Emily, â€˜to whom I owe so much more than
acknowledgments can ever pay, how could you be so rash?â€™

â€˜My father--my uncle--this paragraph,â€™--he handed the paper to Colonel
Talbot.

â€˜I wish to Heaven these scoundrels were condemned to be squeezed to death
in their own presses,â€™ said Talbot. â€˜I am told there are not less than a
dozen of their papers now published in town, and no wonder that they are
obliged to invent lies to find sale for their journals. It is true,
however, my dear Edward, that you have lost your father; but as to this
flourish of his unpleasant situation having grated upon his spirits and
hurt his health--the truth is--for though it is harsh to say so now, yet
it will relieve your mind from the idea of weighty responsibility--the
truth then is, that Mr. Richard Waverley, through this whole business,
showed great want of sensibility, both to your situation and that of your
uncle; and the last time I saw him, he told me, with great glee, that, as
I was so good as to take charge of your interests, he had thought it best
to patch up a separate negotiation for himself, and make his peace with
government through some channels which former connexions left still open
to him.â€™

â€˜And my uncle, my dear uncle?â€™

â€˜Is in no danger whatever. It is true (looking at the date of the paper)
there was a foolish report some time ago to the purport here quoted, but
it is entirely false. Sir Everard is gone down to Waverley-Honour, freed
from all uneasiness, unless upon your own account. But you are in peril
yourself; your name is in every proclamation; warrants are out to
apprehend you. How and when did you come here?â€™

Edward told his story at length, suppressing his quarrel with Fergus;
for, being himself partial to Highlanders, he did not wish to give any
advantage to the Colonelâ€™s national prejudice against them.

â€˜Are you sure it was your friend Glenâ€™s foot-boy you saw dead in Clifton
Moor?â€™

â€˜Quite positive.â€™

â€˜Then that little limb of the devil has cheated the gallows, for
cut-throat was written in his face; though (turning to Lady Emily) it was
a very handsome face too. But for you, Edward, I wish you would go down
again to Cumberland, or rather I wish you had never stirred from thence,
for there is an embargo in all the seaports, and a strict search for the
adherents of the Pretender; and the tongue of that confounded woman will
wag in her head like the clack of a mill, till somehow or other she will
detect Captain Butler to be a feigned personage.â€™

â€˜Do you know anything,â€™ asked Waverley, â€˜of my fellow-traveller?â€™

â€˜Her husband was my sergeant-major for six years; she was a buxom widow,
with a little money; he married her, was steady, and got on by being a
good drill. I must send Spontoon to see what she is about; he will find
her out among the old regimental connections. To-morrow you must be
indisposed, and keep your room from fatigue. Lady Emily is to be your
nurse, and Spontoon and I your attendants. You bear the name of a near
relation of mine, whom none of my present people ever saw, except
Spontoon, so there will be no immediate danger. So pray feel your head
ache and your eyes grow heavy as soon as possible, that you may be put
upon the sick-list; and, Emily, do you order an apartment for Frank
Stanley, with all the attentions which an invalid may require.â€™

In the morning the Colonel visited his guest. â€˜Now,â€™ said he, â€˜I have
some good news for you. Your reputation as a gentleman and officer is
effectually cleared of neglect of duty and accession to the mutiny in
Gardinerâ€™s regiment. I have had a correspondence on this subject with a
very zealous friend of yours, your Scottish parson, Morton; his first
letter was addressed to Sir Everard; but I relieved the good Baronet of
the trouble of answering it. You must know, that your free-booting
acquaintance, Donald of the Cave, has at length fallen into the hands of
the Philistines. He was driving off the cattle of a certain proprietor,
called Killan--something or other--â€™

â€˜Killancureit?â€™

â€˜The same. Now the gentleman being, it seems, a great farmer, and having
a special value for his breed of cattle, being, moreover, rather of a
timid disposition, had got a party of soldiers to protect his property.
So Donald ran his head unawares into the lionâ€™s mouth, and was defeated
and made prisoner. Being ordered for execution, his conscience was
assailed on the one hand by a Catholic priest, on the other by your
friend Morton. He repulsed the Catholic chiefly on account of the
doctrine of extreme unction, which this economical gentleman considered
as an excessive waste of oil. So his conversion from a state of
impenitence fell to Mr. Mortonâ€™s share, who, I daresay, acquitted himself
excellently, though I suppose Donald made but a queer kind of Christian
after all. He confessed, however, before a magistrate, one Major
Melville, who seems to have been a correct, friendly sort of person, his
full intrigue with Houghton, explaining particularly how it was carried
on, and fully acquitting you of the least accession to it. He also
mentioned his rescuing you from the hands of the volunteer officer, and
sending you, by orders of the Pret--Chevalier, I mean--as a prisoner to
Doune, from whence he understood you were carried prisoner to Edinburgh.
These are particulars which cannot but tell in your favour. He hinted
that he had been employed to deliver and protect you, and rewarded for
doing so; but he would not confess by whom, alleging that, though he
would not have minded breaking any ordinary oath to satisfy the curiosity
of Mr. Morton, to whose pious admonitions he owed so much, yet, in the
present case he had been sworn to silence upon the edge of his dirk,
[Footnote: See Note 38.] which, it seems, constituted, in his opinion, an
inviolable obligation.â€™

â€˜And what is become of him?â€™

â€˜Oh, he was hanged at Stirling after the rebels raised the siege, with
his lieutenant and four plaids besides; he having the advantage of a
gallows more lofty than his friends.â€™

â€˜Well, I have little cause either to regret or rejoice at his death; and
yet he has done me both good and harm to a very considerable extent.â€™

â€˜His confession, at least, will serve you materially, since it wipes from
your character all those suspicions which gave the accusation against you
a complexion of a nature different from that with which so many
unfortunate gentlemen, now or lately in arms against the government, may
be justly charged. Their treason--I must give it its name, though you
participate in its guilt--is an action arising from mistaken virtue, and
therefore cannot be classed as a disgrace, though it be doubtless highly
criminal. Where the guilty are so numerous, clemency must be extended to
far the greater number; and I have little doubt of procuring a remission
for you, providing we can keep you out of the claws of justice till she
has selected and gorged upon her victims; for in this, as in other cases,
it will be according to the vulgar proverb, â€œFirst come, first served.â€
 Besides, government are desirous at present to intimidate the English
Jacobites, among whom they can find few examples for punishment. This is
a vindictive and timid feeling which will soon wear off, for of all
nations the English are least blood-thirsty by nature. But it exists at
present, and you must therefore be kept out of the way in the mean-time.â€™

Now entered Spontoon with an anxious countenance. By his regimental
acquaintances he had traced out Madam Nosebag, and found her full of ire,
fuss, and fidget at discovery of an impostor who had travelled from the
north with her under the assumed name of Captain Butler of Gardinerâ€™s
dragoons. She was going to lodge an information on the subject, to have
him sought for as an emissary of the Pretender; but Spontoon (an old
soldier), while he pretended to approve, contrived to make her delay her
intention. No time, however, was to be lost: the accuracy of this good
dameâ€™s description might probably lead to the discovery that Waverley was
the pretended Captain Butler, an identification fraught with danger to
Edward, perhaps to his uncle, and even to Colonel Talbot. Which way to
direct his course was now, therefore, the question.

â€˜To Scotland,â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜To Scotland?â€™ said the Colonel; â€˜with what purpose? not to engage again
with the rebels, I hope?â€™

â€˜No; I considered my campaign ended when, after all my efforts, I could
not rejoin them; and now, by all accounts, they are gone to make a winter
campaign in the Highlands, where such adherents as I am would rather be
burdensome than useful. Indeed, it seems likely that they only prolong
the war to place the Chevalierâ€™s person out of danger, and then to make
some terms for themselves. To burden them with my presence would merely
add another party, whom they would not give up and could not defend. I
understand they left almost all their English adherents in garrison at
Carlisle, for that very reason. And on a more general view, Colonel, to
confess the truth, though it may lower me in your opinion, I am heartly
tired of the trade of war, and am, as Fletcherâ€™s Humorous Lieutenant
says, â€œeven as weary of this fighting-â€™â€

â€˜Fighting! pooh, what have you seen but a skirmish or two? Ah! if you saw
war on the grand scale--sixty or a hundred thousand men in the field on
each side!â€™

â€˜I am not at all curious, Colonel. â€œEnough,â€ says our homely proverb, â€œis
as good as a feast.â€ The plumed troops and the big war used to enchant me
in poetry, but the night marches, vigils, couches under the wintry sky,
and such accompaniments of the glorious trade, are not at all to my taste
in practice; then for dry blows, I had MY fill of fighting at Clifton,
where I escaped by a hairâ€™s-breadth half a dozen times; and you, I should
think--â€™ He stopped.

â€˜Had enough of it at Preston? you mean to say,â€™ answered the Colonel,
laughing; â€˜but â€˜tis my vocation, Hal.â€™

â€˜It is not mine, though,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜and having honourably got rid
of the sword, which I drew only as a volunteer, I am quite satisfied with
my military experience, and shall be in no hurry to take it up again.â€™

â€˜I am very glad you are of that mind; but then what would you do in the
north?â€™

â€˜In the first place, there are some seaports on the eastern coast of
Scotland still in the hands of the Chevalierâ€™s friends; should I gain any
of them, I can easily embark for the Continent.â€™

â€˜Good, your second reason?â€™

â€˜Why, to speak the very truth, there is a person in Scotland upon whom I
now find my happiness depends more than I was always aware, and about
whose situation I am very anxious.â€™

â€˜Then Emily was right, and there is a love affair in the case after all?
And which of these two pretty Scotchwomen, whom you insisted upon my
admiring, is the distinguished fair? not Miss Glen--I hope.â€™

â€˜No.â€™

â€˜Ah, pass for the other; simplicity may be improved, but pride and
conceit never. Well, I donâ€™t discourage you; I think it will please Sir
Everard, from what he said when I jested with him about it; only I hope
that intolerable papa, with his brogue, and his snuff, and his Latin, and
his insufferable long stories about the Duke of Berwick, will find it
necessary hereafter to be an inhabitant of foreign parts. But as to the
daughter, though I think you might find as fitting a match in England,
yet if your heart be really set upon this Scotch rosebud, why the Baronet
has a great opinion of her father and of his family, and he wishes much
to see you married and settled, both for your own sake and for that of
the three ermines passant, which may otherwise pass away altogether. But
I will bring you his mind fully upon the subject, since you are debarred
correspondence for the present, for I think you will not be long in
Scotland before me.â€™

â€˜Indeed! and what can induce you to think of returning to Scotland? No
relenting longings towards the land of mountains and floods, I am
afraid.â€™

â€˜None, on my word; but Emilyâ€™s health is now, thank God, reestablished,
and, to tell you the truth, I have little hopes of concluding the
business which I have at present most at heart until I can have a
personal interview with his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief; for,
as Fluellen says, â€œthe duke doth love me well, and I thank heaven I have
deserved some love at his hands.â€ I am now going out for an hour or two
to arrange matters for your departure; your liberty extends to the next
room, Lady Emilyâ€™s parlour, where you will find her when you are disposed
for music, reading, or conversation. We have taken measures to exclude
all servants but Spontoon, who is as true as steel.â€™

In about two hours Colonel Talbot returned, and found his young friend
conversing with his lady; she pleased with his manners and information,
and he delighted at being restored, though but for a moment, to the
society of his own rank, from which he had been for some time excluded.

â€˜And now,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜hear my arrangements, for there is little
time to lose. This youngster, Edward Waverley, alias Williams, alias
Captain Butler, must continue to pass by his fourth ALIAS of Francis
Stanley, my nephew; he shall set out to-morrow for the North, and the
chariot shall take him the first two stages. Spontoon shall then attend
him; and they shall ride post as far as Huntingdon; and the presence of
Spontoon, well known on the road as my servant, will check all
disposition to inquiry. At Huntingdon you will meet the real Frank
Stanley. He is studying at Cambridge; but, a little while ago, doubtful
if Emilyâ€™s health would permit me to go down to the North myself, I
procured him a passport from the secretary of stateâ€™s office to go in my
stead. As he went chiefly to look after you, his journey is now
unnecessary. He knows your story; you will dine together at Huntingdon;
and perhaps your wise heads may hit upon some plan for removing or
diminishing the danger of your farther progress north-ward. And now
(taking out a morocco case), let me put you in funds for the campaign.â€™

â€˜I am ashamed, my dear Colonel--â€™

â€˜Nay,â€™ said Colonel Talbot, â€˜you should command my purse in any event;
but this money is your own. Your father, considering the chance of your
being attainted, left me his trustee for your advantage. So that you are
worth above L15,000, besides Brere-Wood Lodge--a very independent person,
I promise you. There are bills here for L200; any larger sum you may
have, or credit abroad, as soon as your motions require it.â€™

The first use which occurred to Waverley of his newly acquired wealth was
to write to honest Farmer Jopson, requesting his acceptance of a silver
tankard on the part of his friend Williams, who had not forgotten the
night of the eighteenth December last. He begged him at the same time
carefully to preserve for him his Highland garb and accoutrements,
particularly the arms, curious in themselves, and to which the friendship
of the donors gave additional value. Lady Emily undertook to find some
suitable token of remembrance likely to flatter the vanity and please the
taste of Mrs. Williams; and the Colonel, who was a kind of farmer,
promised to send the Ullswater patriarch an excellent team of horses for
cart and plough.

One happy day Waverley spent in London; and, travelling in the manner
projected, he met with Frank Stanley at Huntingdon. The two young men
were acquainted in a minute.

â€˜I can read my uncleâ€™s riddle,â€™ said Stanley; â€˜the cautious old soldier
did not care to hint to me that I might hand over to you this passport,
which I have no occasion for; but if it should afterwards come out as the
rattle-pated trick of a young Cantab, cela ne tire a rien. You are
therefore to be Francis Stanley, with this passport.â€™ This proposal
appeared in effect to alleviate a great part of the difficulties which
Edward must otherwise have encountered at every turn; and accordingly he
scrupled not to avail himself of it, the more especially as he had
discarded all political purposes from his present journey, and could not
be accused of furthering machinations against the government while
travelling under protection of the secretaryâ€™s passport.

The day passed merrily away. The young student was inquisitive about
Waverleyâ€™s campaigns, and the manners of the Highlands, and Edward was
obliged to satisfy his curiosity by whistling a pibroch, dancing a
strathspey, and singing a Highland song. The next morning Stanley rode a
stage northward with his new friend, and parted from him with great
reluctance, upon the remonstrances of Spontoon, who, accustomed to submit
to discipline, was rigid in enforcing it.




CHAPTER XXXIV

DESOLATION


Waverley riding post, as was the usual fashion of the period, without any
adventure save one or two queries, which the talisman of his passport
sufficiently answered, reached the borders of Scotland. Here he heard the
tidings of the decisive battle of Culloden. It was no more than he had
long expected, though the success at Falkirk had thrown a faint and
setting gleam over the arms of the Chevalier. Yet it came upon him like a
shock, by which he was for a time altogether unmanned. The generous, the
courteous, the noble-minded adventurer was then a fugitive, with a price
upon his head; his adherents, so brave, so enthusiastic, so faithful,
were dead, imprisoned, or exiled. Where, now, was the exalted and
high-souled Fergus, if, indeed, he had survived the night at Clifton?
Where the pure-hearted and primitive Baron of Bradwardine, whose foibles
seemed foils to set off the disinterestedness of his disposition, the
genuine goodness of his heart, and his unshaken courage? Those who clung
for support to these fallen columns, Rose and Flora, where were they to
be sought, and in what distress must not the loss of their natural
protectors have involved them? Of Flora he thought with the regard of a
brother for a sister; of Rose with a sensation yet more deep and tender.
It might be still his fate to supply the want of those guardians they had
lost. Agitated by these thoughts he precipitated his journey.

When he arrived in Edinburgh, where his inquiries must necessarily
commence, he felt the full difficulty of his situation. Many inhabitants
of that city had seen and known him as Edward Waverley; how, then, could
he avail himself of a passport as Francis Stanley? He resolved,
therefore, to avoid all company, and to move northward as soon as
possible. He was, however, obliged to wait a day or two in expectation of
a letter from Colonel Talbot, and he was also to leave his own address,
under his feigned character, at a place agreed upon. With this latter
purpose he sallied out in the dusk through the well-known streets,
carefully shunning observation, but in vain: one of the first persons
whom he met at once recognised him. It was Mrs. Flockhart, Fergus
Mac-Ivorâ€™s good-humoured landlady.

â€˜Gude guide us, Mr. Waverley, is this you? na, ye needna be feared for
me. I wad betray nae gentleman in your circumstances. Eh, lack-a-day!
lack-a-day! hereâ€™s a change oâ€™ markets; how merry Colonel Mac-Ivor and
you used to be in our house!â€™ And the good-natured widow shed a few
natural tears. As there was no resisting her claim of acquaintance,
Waverley acknowledged it with a good grace, as well as the danger of his
own situation. â€˜As itâ€™s near the darkening, sir, wad ye just step in by
to our house and tak a dish oâ€™ tea? and I am sure if ye like to sleep in
the little room, I wad tak care ye are no disturbed, and naebody wad ken
ye; for Kate and Matty, the limmers, gaed aff wiâ€™ twa oâ€™ Hawleyâ€™s
dragoons, and I hae twa new queans instead oâ€™ them.â€™

Waverley accepted her invitation, and engaged her lodging for a night or
two, satisfied he should be safer in the house of this simple creature
than anywhere else. When he entered the parlour his heart swelled to see
Fergusâ€™s bonnet, with the white cockade, hanging beside the little
mirror.

â€˜Ay,â€™ said Mrs. Flockhart, sighing, as she observed the direction of his
eyes, â€˜the puir Colonel bought a new ane just the day before they
marched, and I winna let them tak that ane doun, but just to brush it
ilka day mysell; and whiles I look at it till I just think I hear him cry
to Callum to bring him his bonnet, as he used to do when he was ganging
out. Itâ€™s unco silly--the neighbours caâ€™ me a Jacobite, but they may say
their say--I am sure itâ€™s no for that--but he was as kind-hearted a
gentleman as ever lived, and as weel-faâ€™rd too. Oh, dâ€™ye ken, sir, when
he is to suffer?â€™

â€˜Suffer! Good heaven! Why, where is he?â€™

â€˜Eh, Lordâ€™s sake! dâ€™ye no ken? The poor Hieland body, Dugald Mahony, cam
here a while syne, wiâ€™ ane oâ€™ his arms cuttit off, and a sair clour in
the head--yeâ€™ll mind Dugald, he carried aye an axe on his shouther--and
he cam here just begging, as I may say, for something to eat. Aweel, he
tauld us the Chief, as they caâ€™d him (but I aye caâ€™ him the Colonel), and
Ensign Maccombich, that ye mind weel, were taâ€™en somewhere beside the
English border, when it was sae dark that his folk never missed him till
it was ower late, and they were like to gang clean daft. And he said that
little Callum Beg (he was a bauld mischievous callant that) and your
honour were killed that same night in the tuilzie, and mony mae braw men.
But he grat when he spak oâ€™ the Colonel, ye never saw the like. And now
the word gangs the Colonel is to be tried, and to suffer wiâ€™ them that
were taâ€™en at Carlisle.â€™

â€˜And his sister?â€™

â€˜Ay, that they caâ€™d the Lady Flora--weel, sheâ€™s away up to Carlisle to
him, and lives wiâ€™ some grand Papist lady thereabouts to be near him.â€™

â€˜And,â€™ said Edward, â€˜the other young lady?â€™

â€˜Whilk other? I ken only of ae sister the Colonel had.â€™

â€˜I mean Miss Bradwardine,â€™ said Edward.

â€˜Ou, ay; the lairdâ€™s daughterâ€™ said his landlady. â€˜She was a very bonny
lassie, poor thing, but far shyer than Lady Flora.â€™

â€˜Where is she, for Godâ€™s sake?â€™

â€˜Ou, wha kens where ony oâ€™ them is now? puir things, theyâ€™re sair taâ€™en
doun for their white cockades and their white roses; but she gaed north
to her fatherâ€™s in Perthshire, when the government troops cam back to
Edinbroâ€™. There was some prettymen amang them, and ane Major Whacker was
quartered on me, a very ceevil gentleman,--but O, Mr. Waverley, he was
naething sae weel faâ€™rd as the puir Colonel.â€™

â€˜Do you know what is become of Miss Bradwardineâ€™s father?â€™

â€˜The auld laird? na, naebody kens that. But they say he fought very hard
in that bluidy battle at Inverness; and Deacon Clank, the whit-iron
smith, says that the government folk are sair agane him for having been
out twice; and troth he might hae taâ€™en warning, but thereâ€™s nae Me like
an auld fule. The puir Colonel was only out ance.â€™

Such conversation contained almost all the good-natured widow knew of the
fate of her late lodgers and acquaintances; but it was enough to
determine Edward, at all hazards, to proceed instantly to Tully-Veolan,
where he concluded he should see, or at least hear, something of Rose. He
therefore left a letter for Colonel Talbot at the place agreed upon,
signed by his assumed name, and giving for his address the post-town next
to the Baronâ€™s residence.

From Edinburgh to Perth he took post-horses, resolving to make the rest
of his journey on foot; a mode of travelling to which he was partial, and
which had the advantage of permitting a deviation from the road when he
saw parties of military at a distance. His campaign had considerably
strengthened his constitution and improved his habits of enduring
fatigue. His baggage he sent before him as opportunity occurred.

As he advanced northward, the traces of war became visible. Broken
carriages, dead horses, unroofed cottages, trees felled for palisades,
and bridges destroyed or only partially repaired--all indicated the
movements of hostile armies. In those places where the gentry were
attached to the Stuart cause, their houses seemed dismantled or deserted,
the usual course of what may be called ornamental labour was totally
interrupted, and the inhabitants were seen gliding about, with fear,
sorrow, and dejection on their faces.

It was evening when he approached the village of Tully-Veolan, with
feelings and sentiments--how different from those which attended his
first entrance! Then, life was so new to him that a dull or disagreeable
day was one of the greatest misfortunes which his imagination
anticipated, and it seemed to him that his time ought only to be
consecrated to elegant or amusing study, and relieved by social or
youthful frolic. Now, how changed! how saddened, yet how elevated was his
character, within the course of a very few months! Danger and misfortune
are rapid, though severe teachers. â€˜A sadder and a wiser man,â€™ he felt in
internal confidence and mental dignity a compensation for the gay dreams
which in his case experience had so rapidly dissolved.

As he approached the village he saw, with surprise and anxiety, that a
party of soldiers were quartered near it, and, what was worse, that they
seemed stationary there. This he conjectured from a few tents which he
beheld glimmering upon what was called the Common Moor. To avoid the risk
of being stopped and questioned in a place where he was so likely to be
recognised, he made a large circuit, altogether avoiding the hamlet, and
approaching the upper gate of the avenue by a by-path well known to him.
A single glance announced that great changes had taken place. One half of
the gate, entirely destroyed and split up for firewood, lay in piles,
ready to be taken away; the other swung uselessly about upon its loosened
hinges. The battlements above the gate were broken and thrown down, and
the carved bears, which were said to have done sentinelâ€™s duty upon the
top for centuries, now, hurled from their posts, lay among the rubbish.
The avenue was cruelly wasted. Several large trees were felled and left
lying across the path; and the cattle of the villagers, and the more rude
hoofs of dragoon horses, had poached into black mud the verdant turf
which Waverley had so much admired.

Upon entering the court-yard, Edward saw the fears realised which these
circumstances had excited. The place had been sacked by the Kingâ€™s
troops, who, in wanton mischief, had even attempted to burn it; and
though the thickness of the walls had resisted the fire, unless to a
partial extent, the stables and out-houses were totally consumed. The
towers and pinnacles of the main building were scorched and blackened;
the pavement of the court broken and shattered, the doors torn down
entirely, or hanging by a single hinge, the windows dashed in and
demolished, and the court strewed with articles of furniture broken into
fragments. The accessaries of ancient distinction, to which the Baron, in
the pride of his heart, had attached so much importance and veneration,
were treated with peculiar contumely. The fountain was demolished, and
the spring which had supplied it now flooded the court-yard. The stone
basin seemed to be destined for a drinking-trough for cattle, from the
manner in which it was arranged upon the ground. The whole tribe of
bears, large and small, had experienced as little favour as those at the
head of the avenue, and one or two of the family pictures, which seemed
to have served as targets for the soldiers, lay on the ground in tatters.
With an aching heart, as may well be imagined, Edward viewed this wreck
of a mansion so respected. But his anxiety to learn the fate of the
proprietors, and his fears as to what that fate might be, increased with
every step. When he entered upon the terrace new scenes of desolation
were visible. The balustrade was broken down, the walls destroyed, the
borders overgrown with weeds, and the fruit-trees cut down or grubbed up.
In one compartment of this old-fashioned garden were two immense
horse-chestnut trees, of whose size the Baron was particularly vain; too
lazy, perhaps, to cut them down, the spoilers, with malevolent ingenuity,
had mined them and placed a quantity of gunpowder in the cavity. One had
been shivered to pieces by the explosion, and the fragments lay scattered
around, encumbering the ground it had so long shadowed. The other mine
had been more partial in its effect. About one-fourth of the trunk of the
tree was torn from the mass, which, mutilated and defaced on the one
side, still spread on the other its ample and undiminished boughs.
[Footnote: A pair of chestnut trees, destroyed, the one entirely and the
other in part, by such a mischievous and wanton act of revenge, grew at
Invergarry Castle, the fastness of MacDonald of Glengarry.]

Amid these general marks of ravage, there were some which more
particularly addressed the feelings of Waverley. Viewing the front of the
building thus wasted and defaced, his eyes naturally sought the little
balcony which more properly belonged to Roseâ€™s apartment, her troisieme,
or rather cinquieme, etage. It was easily discovered, for beneath it lay
the stage-flowers and shrubs with which it was her pride to decorate it,
and which had been hurled from the bartizan; several of her books were
mingled with broken flower-pots and other remnants. Among these Waverley
distinguished one of his own, a small copy of Ariosto, and gathered it as
a treasure, though wasted by the wind and rain.

While, plunged in the sad reflections which the scene excited, he was
looking around for some one who might explain the fate of the
inhabitants, he heard a voice from the interior of the building singing,
in well-remembered accents, an old Scottish song:--

    They came upon us in the night,
    And brake my bower and slew my knight;
    My servants aâ€™ for life did flee,
    And left us in extremitie.

    They slew my knight, to me sae dear;
    They slew my knight, and drave his gear;
    The moon may set, the sun may rise,
    But a deadly sleep has closed his eyes.

[Footnote: The first three couplets are from an old ballad, called the
Border Widowâ€™s Lament.]

â€˜Alas,â€™ thought Edward, â€˜is it thou? Poor helpless being, art thou alone
left, to gibber and moan, and fill with thy wild and unconnected scraps
of minstrelsy the halls that protected thee?â€™ He then called, first low,
and then louder, â€˜Davie--Davie Gellatley!â€™

The poor simpleton showed himself from among the ruins of a sort of
greenhouse, that once terminated what was called the terrace-walk, but at
first sight of a stranger retreated, as if in terror. Waverley,
remembering his habits, began to whistle a tune to which he was partial,
which Davie had expressed great pleasure in listening to, and had picked
up from him by the ear. Our heroâ€™s minstrelsy no more equalled that of
Blondel than poor Davie resembled Coeur de Lion; but the melody had the
same effect of producing recognition. Davie again stole from his
lurking-place, but timidly, while Waverley, afraid of frightening him,
stood making the most encouraging signals he could devise. â€˜Itâ€™s his
ghaist,â€™ muttered Davie; yet, coming nearer, he seemed to acknowledge his
living acquaintance. The poor fool himself appeared the ghost of what he
had been. The peculiar dress in which he had been attired in better days
showed only miserable rags of its whimsical finery, the lack of which was
oddly supplied by the remnants of tapestried hangings, window-curtains,
and shreds of pictures with which he had bedizened his tatters. His face,
too, had lost its vacant and careless air, and the poor creature looked
hollow-eyed, meagre, half-starved, and nervous to a pitiable degree.
After long hesitation, he at length approached Waverley with some
confidence, stared him sadly in the face, and said, â€˜Aâ€™ dead and gane--aâ€™
dead and gane.â€™

â€˜Who are dead?â€™ said Waverley, forgetting the incapacity of Davie to hold
any connected discourse.

â€˜Baron, and Bailie, and Saunders Saunderson, and Lady Rose that sang sae
sweet--aâ€™ dead and gane--dead and gane;

    But follow, follow me,
    While glowworms light the lea,
    Iâ€™ll show ye where the dead should be--
      Each in his shroud,
      While winds pipe loud,
      And the red moon peeps dim through the cloud.
    Follow, follow me;
    Brave should he be
    That treads by night the dead manâ€™s lea.â€™

With these words, chanted in a wild and earnest tone, he made a sign to
Waverley to follow him, and walked rapidly towards the bottom of the
garden, tracing the bank of the stream which, it may be remembered, was
its eastern boundary. Edward, over whom an involuntary shuddering stole
at the import of his words, followed him in some hope of an explanation.
As the house was evidently deserted, he could not expect to find among
the ruins any more rational informer.

Davie, walking very fast, soon reached the extremity of the garden, and
scrambled over the ruins of the wall that once had divided it from the
wooded glen in which the old tower of Tully-Veolan was situated. He then
jumped down into the bed of the stream, and, followed by Waverley,
proceeded at a great pace, climbing over some fragments of rock and
turning with difficulty round others. They passed beneath the ruins of
the castle; Waverley followed, keeping up with his guide with difficulty,
for the twilight began to fall. Following the descent of the stream a
little lower, he totally lost him, but a twinkling light which he now
discovered among the tangled copse-wood and bushes seemed a surer guide.
He soon pursued a very uncouth path; and by its guidance at length
reached the door of a wretched hut. A fierce barking of dogs was at first
heard, but it stilled at his approach. A voice sounded from within, and
he held it most prudent to listen before he advanced.

â€˜Wha hast thou brought here, thou unsonsy villain, thou?â€™ said an old
woman, apparently in great indignation. He heard Davie Gellatley in
answer whistle a part of the tune by which he had recalled himself to the
simpletonâ€™s memory, and had now no hesitation to knock at the door. There
was a dead silence instantly within, except the deep growling of the
dogs; and he next heard the mistress of the hut approach the door, not
probably for the sake of undoing a latch, but of fastening a bolt. To
prevent this Waverley lifted the latch himself.

In front was an old wretched-looking woman, exclaiming, â€˜Wha comes into
folkâ€™s houses in this gate, at this time oâ€™ the night?â€™ On one side, two
grim and half-starved deer greyhounds laid aside their ferocity at his
appearance, and seemed to recognise him. On the other side, half
concealed by the open door, yet apparently seeking that concealment
reluctantly, with a cocked pistol in his right hand and his left in the
act of drawing another from his belt, stood a tall bony gaunt figure in
the remnants of a faded uniform and a beard of three weeksâ€™ growth. It
was the Baron of Bradwardine. It is unnecessary to add, that he threw
aside his weapon and greeted Waverley with a hearty embrace.




CHAPTER XXXV

COMPARING OF NOTES


Thearonâ€™s story was short, when divested of the adages and commonplaces,
Latin, English, and Scotch, with which his erudition garnished it. He
insisted much upon his grief at the loss of Edward and of Glennaquoich,
fought the fields of Falkirk and Culloden, and related how, after all was
lost in the last battle, he had returned home, under the idea of more
easily finding shelter among his own tenants and on his own estate than
elsewhere. A party of soldiers had been sent to lay waste his property,
for clemency was not the order of the day. Their proceedings, however,
were checked by an order from the civil court. The estate, it was found,
might not be forfeited to the crown to the prejudice of Malcolm
Bradwardine of Inch-Grabbit, the heir-male, whose claim could not be
prejudiced by the Baronâ€™s attainder, as deriving no right through him,
and who, therefore, like other heirs of entail in the same situation,
entered upon possession. But, unlike many in similar circumstances, the
new laird speedily showed that he intended utterly to exclude his
predecessor from all benefit or advantage in the estate, and that it was
his purpose to avail himself of the old Baronâ€™s evil fortune to the full
extent. This was the more ungenerous, as it was generally known that,
from a romantic idea of not prejudicing this young manâ€™s right as
heir-male, the Baron had refrained from settling his estate on his
daughter.

This selfish injustice was resented by the country people, who were
partial to their old master, and irritated against his successor. In the
Baronâ€™s own words, â€˜The matter did not coincide with the feelings of the
commons of Bradwardine, Mr. Waverley; and the tenants were slack and
repugnant in payment of their mails and duties; and when my kinsman came
to the village wiâ€™ the new factor, Mr. James Howie, to lift the rents,
some wanchancy person--I suspect John Heatherblutter, the auld
gamekeeper, that was out wiâ€™ me in the year fifteen--fired a shot at him
in the gloaming, whereby he was so affrighted, that I may say with
Tullius In Catilinam, â€œAbiit, evasit, erupit, effugit.â€ He fled, sir, as
one may say, incontinent to Stirling. And now he hath advertised the
estate for sale, being himself the last substitute in the entail. And if
I were to lament about sic matters, this would grieve me mair than its
passing from my immediate possession, whilk, by the course of nature,
must have happened in a few years; whereas now it passes from the lineage
that should have possessed it in s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum. But Godâ€™s will be
done, humana perpessi sumus. Sir John of Bradwardine--Black Sir John, as
he is called--who was the common ancestor of our house and the
Inch-Grabbits, little thought such a person would have sprung from his
loins. Mean time, he has accused me to some of the primates, the rulers
for the time, as if I were a cut-throat, and an abettor of bravoes and
assassinates and coupe-jarrets. And they have sent soldiers here to abide
on the estate, and hunt me like a partridge upon the mountains, as
Scripture says of good King David, or like our valiant Sir William
Wallace--not that I bring myself into comparison with either. I thought,
when I heard you at the door, they had driven the auld deer to his den at
last; and so I eâ€™en proposed to die at bay, like a buck of the first
head. But now, Janet, canna ye gie us something for supper?â€™

â€˜Ou ay, sir, Iâ€™ll brander the moor-fowl that John Heatherblutter brought
in this morning; and ye see puir Davieâ€™s roasting the black henâ€™s eggs.
I daur say, Mr. Wauverley, ye never kend that aâ€™ the eggs that were sae
weel roasted at supper in the Haâ€™-house were aye turned by our Davie?
thereâ€™s no the like oâ€™ him ony gate for powtering wiâ€™ his fingers amang
the het peat-ashes and roasting eggs.â€™ Davie all this while lay with his
nose almost in the fire, nuzzling among the ashes, kicking his heels,
mumbling to himself, turning the eggs as they lay in the hot embers, as
if to confute the proverb, that â€˜there goes reason to roasting of eggs,â€™
and justify the eulogium which poor Janet poured out upon

    Him whom she loved, her idiot boy.

â€˜Davieâ€™s no sae silly as folk tak him for, Mr. Wauverley; he wadna hae
brought you here unless he had kend ye was a friend to his Honour; indeed
the very dogs kend ye, Mr. Wauverley, for ye was aye kind to beast and
body. I can tell you a story oâ€™ Davie, wiâ€™ his Honourâ€™s leave. His
Honour, ye see, being under hiding in thae sair times--the mairâ€™s the
pity--he lies aâ€™ day, and whiles aâ€™ night, in the cove in the dern hag;
but though itâ€™s a bieldy eneugh bit, and the auld gudeman oâ€™ Corse-Cleugh
has panged it wiâ€™ a kemple oâ€™ strae amaist, yet when the countryâ€™s quiet,
and the night very cauld, his Honour whiles creeps doun here to get a
warm at the ingle and a sleep amang the blankets, and gangs awa in the
morning. And so, ae morning, siccan a fright as I got! Twa unlucky
red-coats were up for black-fishing, or some siccan ploy--for the neb oâ€™
themâ€™s never out oâ€™ mischief--and they just got a glisk oâ€™ his Honour as
he gaed into the wood, and banged aff a gun at him. I out like a
jer-falcon, and cried--â€œWad they shoot an honest womanâ€™s poor innocent
bairn?â€ And I fleyt at them, and threepit it was my son; and they damned
and swuir at me that it was the auld rebel, as the villains caâ€™d his
Honour; and Davie was in the wood, and heard the tuilzie, and he, just
out oâ€™ his ain head, got up the auld grey mantle that his Honour had
flung off him to gang the faster, and he cam out oâ€™ the very same bit oâ€™
the wood, majoring and looking about sae like his Honour, that they were
clean beguiled, and thought they had letten aff their gun at
crack-brained Sawney, as they caâ€™ him; and they gae me saxpence, and twa
saumon fish, to say naething about it. Na, na, Davieâ€™s no just like other
folk, puir fallow; but heâ€™s no sae silly as folk tak him for. But, to be
sure, how can we do eneugh for his Honour, when we and ours have lived on
his ground this twa hundred years; and when he keepit my puir Jamie at
school and college, and even at the Haâ€™-house, till he gaed to a better
place; and when he saved me frae being taâ€™en to Perth as a witch--Lord
forgiâ€™e them that would touch sic a puir silly auld body!--and has
maintained puir Davie at heck and manger maist feck oâ€™ his life?â€™

Waverley at length found an opportunity to interrupt Janetâ€™s narrative by
an inquiry after Miss Bradwardine.

â€˜Sheâ€™s weel and safe, thank God! at the Duchran,â€™ answered the Baron;
â€˜the lairdâ€™s distantly related to us, and more nearly to my chaplain, Mr.
Rubrick; and, though he be of Whig principles, yet heâ€™s not forgetful of
auld friendship at this time. The Bailieâ€™s doing what he can to save
something out of the wreck for puir Rose; but I doubt, I doubt, I shall
never see her again, for I maun lay my banes in some far country.â€™

â€˜Hout na, your Honour,â€™ said old Janet, â€˜ye were just as ill aff in the
feifteen, and got the bonnie baronie back, anâ€™ aâ€™. And now the eggs is
ready, and the muir-cockâ€™s brandered, and thereâ€™s ilk ane a trencher and
some saut, and the heel oâ€™ the white loaf that cam frae the Bailieâ€™s, and
thereâ€™s plenty oâ€™ brandy in the greybeard that Luckie Maclearie sent
doun, and winna ye be suppered like princes?â€™

â€˜I wish one Prince, at least, of our acquaintance may be no worse off,â€™
said the Baron to Waverley, who joined him in cordial hopes for the
safety of the unfortunate Chevalier.

They then began to talk of their future prospects. The Baronâ€™s plan was
very simple. It was, to escape to France, where, by the interest of his
old friends, he hoped to get some military employment, of which he still
conceived himself capable. He invited Waverley to go with him, a proposal
in which he acquiesced, providing the interest of Colonel Talbot should
fail in procuring his pardon. Tacitly he hoped the Baron would sanction
his addresses to Rose, and give him a right to assist him in his exile;
but he forbore to speak on this subject until his own fate should be
decided. They then talked of Glennaquoich, for whom the Baron expressed
great anxiety, although, he observed, he was â€˜the very Achilles of
Horatius Flaccus,--

Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer; which,â€™ he continued, â€˜has been
thus rendered (vernacularly) by Struan Robertson:--

    A fiery etter-cap, a fractious chiel,
    As het as ginger, and as stieve as steel.â€™

Flora had a large and unqualified share of the good old manâ€™s sympathy.

It was now wearing late. Old Janet got into some kind of kennel behind
the hallan; Davie had been long asleep and snoring between Ban and
Buscar. These dogs had followed him to the hut after the mansion-house
was deserted, and there constantly resided; and their ferocity, with the
old womanâ€™s reputation of being a witch, contributed a good deal to keep
visitors from the glen. With this view, Bailie Macwheeble provided Janet
underhand with meal for their maintenance, and also with little articles
of luxury for his patronâ€™s use, in supplying which much precaution was
necessarily used. After some compliments, the Baron occupied his usual
couch, and Waverley reclined in an easy chair of tattered velvet, which
had once garnished the state bed-room of Tully-Veolan (for the furniture
of this mansion was now scattered through all the cottages in the
vicinity), and went to sleep as comfortably as if he had been in a bed of
down.




CHAPTER XXXVI

MORE EXPLANATION


With the first dawn of day, old Janet was scuttling about the house to
wake the Baron, who usually slept sound and heavily.

â€˜I must go back,â€™ he said to Waverley, â€˜to my cove; will you walk down the
glen wiâ€™ me?â€™ They went out together, and followed a narrow and entangled
foot-path, which the occasional passage of anglers or wood-cutters had
traced by the side of the stream. On their way the Baron explained to
Waverley that he would be under no danger in remaining a day or two at
Tully-Veolan, and even in being seen walking about, if he used the
precaution of pretending that he was looking at the estate as agent or
surveyor for an English gentleman who designed to be purchaser. With this
view he recommended to him to visit the Bailie, who still lived at the
factorâ€™s house, called Little Veolan, about a mile from the village,
though he was to remove at next term. Stanleyâ€™s passport would be an
answer to the officer who commanded the military; and as to any of the
country people who might recognise Waverley, the Baron assured him he was
in no danger of being betrayed by them.

â€˜I believe,â€™ said the old man, â€˜half the people of the barony know that
their poor auld laird is somewhere hereabout; for I see they do not
suffer a single bairn to come here a bird-nesting; a practice whilk, when
I was in full possession of my power as baron, I was unable totally to
inhibit. Nay, I often find bits of things in my way, that the poor
bodies, God help them! leave there, because they think they may be useful
to me. I hope they will get a wiser master, and as kind a one as I was.â€™

A natural sigh closed the sentence; but the quiet equanimity with which
the Baron endured his misfortunes had something in it venerable and even
sublime. There was no fruitless repining, no turbid melancholy; he bore
his lot, and the hardships which it involved, with a good-humored, though
serious composure, and used no violent language against the prevailing
party.

â€˜I did what I thought my duty,â€™ said the good old man, â€˜and questionless
they are doing what they think theirs. It grieves me sometimes to look
upon these blackened walls of the house of my ancestors; but doubtless
officers cannot always keep the soldierâ€™s hand from depredation and
spuilzie, and Gustavus Adolphus himself, as ye may read in Colonel Munro
his â€œExpedition with the Worthy Scotch Regiment called Mackayâ€™s Regimentâ€
 did often permit it. Indeed I have myself seen as sad sights as
Tully-Veolan now is when I served with the Marechal Duke of Berwick. To
be sure we may say with Virgilius Maro, Fuimus Troes--and thereâ€™s the end
of an auld sang. But houses and families and men have aâ€™ stood lang
eneugh when they have stood till they fall with honour; and now I hae
gotten a house that is not unlike a domus ultimaâ€™--they were now standing
below a steep rock. â€˜We poor Jacobites,â€™ continued the Baron, looking up,
â€˜are now like the conies in Holy Scripture (which the great traveller
Pococke calleth Jerboa), a feeble people, that make our abode in the
rocks. So, fare you well, my good lad, till we meet at Janetâ€™s in the
even; for I must get into my Patmos, which is no easy matter for my auld
stiff limbs.â€™

With that he began to ascend the rock, striding, with the help of his
hands, from one precarious footstep to another, till he got about
half-way up, where two or three bushes concealed the mouth of a hole,
resembling an oven, into which the Baron insinuated, first his head and
shoulders, and then, by slow gradation, the rest of his long body; his
legs and feet finally disappearing, coiled up like a huge snake entering
his retreat, or a long pedigree introduced with care and difficulty into
the narrow pigeon-hole of an old cabinet. Waverley had the curiosity to
clamber up and look in upon him in his den, as the lurking-place might
well be termed. Upon the whole, he looked not unlike that ingenious
puzzle called â€˜a reel in a bottle,â€™ the marvel of children (and of some
grown people too, myself for one), who can neither comprehend the
mystery how it has got in or how it is to be taken out. The cave was very
narrow, too low in the roof to admit of his standing, or almost of his
sitting up, though he made some awkward attempts at the latter posture.
His sole amusement was the perusal of his old friend Titus Livius, varied
by occasionally scratching Latin proverbs and texts of Scripture with his
knife on the roof and walls of his fortalice, which were of sandstone. As
the cave was dry, and filled with clean straw and withered fern, â€˜it
made,â€™ as he said, coiling himself up with an air of snugness and comfort
which contrasted strangely with his situation, â€˜unless when the wind was
due north, a very passable gite for an old soldier.â€™ Neither, as he
observed, was he without sentries for the purpose of reconnoitring. Davie
and his mother were constantly on the watch to discover and avert danger;
and it was singular what instances of address seemed dictated by the
instinctive attachment of the poor simpleton when his patronâ€™s safety was
concerned.

With Janet, Edward now sought an interview. He had recognised her at
first sight as the old woman who had nursed him during his sickness after
his delivery from Gifted Gilfillan. The hut also, although a little
repaired and somewhat better furnished, was certainly the place of his
confinement; and he now recollected on the common moor of Tully-Veolan
the trunk of a large decayed tree, called the try sting-tree, which he
had no doubt was the same at which the Highlanders rendezvoused on that
memorable night. All this he had combined in his imagination the night
before; but reasons which may probably occur to the reader prevented him
from catechising Janet in the presence of the Baron.

He now commenced the task in good earnest; and the first question was,
Who was the young lady that visited the hut during his illness? Janet
paused for a little; and then observed, that to keep the secret now would
neither do good nor ill to anybody.

â€˜It was just a leddy that hasna her equal in the world--Miss Rose
Bradwardine!â€™

â€˜Then Miss Rose was probably also the author of my deliverance,â€™ inferred
Waverley, delighted at the confirmation of an idea which local
circumstances had already induced him to entertain.

â€˜I wot weel, Mr. Wauverley, and that was she eâ€™en; but sair, sair angry
and affronted wad she hae been, puir thing, if she had thought ye had
been ever to ken a word about the matter; for she garâ€™d me speak aye
Gaelic when ye was in hearing, to mak ye trow we were in the Hielands. I
can speak it weil eneugh, for my mother was a Hieland woman.â€™

A few more questions now brought out the whole mystery respecting
Waverleyâ€™s deliverance from the bondage in which he left Cairnvreckan.
Never did music sound sweeter to an amateur than the drowsy tautology
with which old Janet detailed every circumstance thrilled upon the ears
of Waverley. But my reader is not a lover and I must spare his patience,
by attempting to condense within reasonable compass the narrative which
old Janet spread through a harangue of nearly two hours.

When Waverley communicated to Fergus the letter he had received from Rose
Bradwardine by Davie Gellatley, giving an account of Tully-Veolan being
occupied by a small party of soldiers, that circumstance had struck upon
the busy and active mind of the Chieftain. Eager to distress and narrow
the posts of the enemy, desirous to prevent their establishing a garrison
so near him, and willing also to oblige the Baron--for he often had the
idea of marriage with Rose floating through his brain--he resolved to
send some of his people to drive out the red-coats and to bring Rose to
Glennaquoich. But just as he had ordered Evan with a small party on this
duty, the news of Copeâ€™s having marched into the Highlands, to meet and
disperse the forces of the Chevalier ere they came to a head, obliged him
to join the standard with his whole forces.

He sent to order Donald Bean to attend him; but that cautious freebooter,
who well understood the value of a separate command, instead of joining,
sent various apologies which the pressure of the times compelled Fergus
to admit as current, though not without the internal resolution of being
revenged on him for his procrastination, time and place convenient.
However, as he could not amend the matter, he issued orders to Donald to
descend into the Low Country, drive the soldiers from Tully-Veolan, and,
paying all respect to the mansion of the Baron, to take his abode
somewhere near it, for protection of his daughter and family, and to
harass and drive away any of the armed volunteers or small parties of
military which he might find moving about the vicinity. As this charge
formed a sort of roving commission, which Donald proposed to interpret in
the way most advantageous to himself, as he was relieved from the
immediate terrors of Fergus, and as he had, from former secret services,
some interest in the councils of the Chevalier, he resolved to make hay
while the sun shone. He achieved without difficulty the task of driving
the soldiers from Tully-Veolan; but, although he did not venture to
encroach upon the interior of the family, or to disturb Miss Rose, being
unwilling to make himself a powerful enemy in the Chevalierâ€™s army,
    For well he knew the Baronâ€™s wrath was deadly;
yet he set about to raise contributions and exactions upon the tenantry,
and otherwise to turn the war to his own advantage. Meanwhile he mounted
the white cockade, and waited upon Rose with a pretext of great devotion
for the service in which her father was engaged, and many apologies for
the freedom he must necessarily use for the support of his people. It was
at this moment that Rose learned, by open-mouthed fame, with all sorts of
exaggeration, that Waverley had killed the smith at Cairnvreckan, in an
attempt to arrest him; had been cast into a dungeon by Major Melville of
Cairnvreckan, and was to be executed by martial law within three days. In
the agony which these tidings excited she proposed to Donald Bean the
rescue of the prisoner. It was the very sort of service which he was
desirous to undertake, judging it might constitute a merit of such a
nature as would make amends for any peccadilloes which he might be guilty
of in the country. He had the art, however, pleading all the while duty
and discipline, to hold off, until poor Rose, in the extremity of her
distress, offered to bribe him to the enterprise with some valuable
jewels which had been her motherâ€™s.

Donald Bean, who had served in France, knew, and perhaps over-estimated,
the value of these trinkets. But he also perceived Roseâ€™s apprehensions
of its being discovered that she had parted with her jewels for
Waverleyâ€™s liberation. Resolved this scruple should not part him and the
treasure, he voluntarily offered to take an oath that he would never
mention Miss Roseâ€™s share in the transaction; and, foreseeing convenience
in keeping the oath and no probable advantage in breaking it, he took the
engagement--in order, as he told his lieutenant, to deal handsomely by
the young lady--in the only mode and form which, by a mental paction with
himself, he considered as binding: he swore secrecy upon his drawn dirk.
He was the more especially moved to this act of good faith by some
attentions that Miss Bradwardine showed to his daughter Alice, which,
while they gained the heart of the mountain damsel, highly gratified the
pride of her father. Alice, who could now speak a little English, was
very communicative in return for Roseâ€™s kindness, readily confided to her
the whole papers respecting the intrigue with Gardinerâ€™s regiment, of
which she was the depositary, and as readily undertook, at her instance,
to restore them to Waverley without her fatherâ€™s knowledge. For â€˜they may
oblige the bonnie young lady and the handsome young gentleman,â€™ said
Alice, â€˜and what use has my father for a whin bits oâ€™ scarted paper?â€™

The reader is aware that she took an opportunity of executing this
purpose on the eve of Waverleyâ€™s leaving the glen.

How Donald executed his enterprise the reader is aware. But the expulsion
of the military from Tully-Veolan had given alarm, and while he was lying
in wait for Gilfillan, a strong party, such as Donald did not care to
face, was sent to drive back the insurgents in their turn, to encamp
there, and to protect the country. The officer, a gentleman and a
disciplinarian, neither intruded himself on Miss Bradwardine, whose
unprotected situation he respected, nor permitted his soldiers to commit
any breach of discipline. He formed a little camp upon an eminence near
the house of Tully-Veolan, and placed proper guards at the passes in the
vicinity. This unwelcome news reached Donald Bean Lean as he was
returning to Tully-Veolan. Determined, however, to obtain the guerdon of
his labour, he resolved, since approach to Tully-Veolan was impossible,
to deposit his prisoner in Janetâ€™s cottage, a place the very existence of
which could hardly have been suspected even by those who had long lived
in the vicinity, unless they had been guided thither, and which was
utterly unknown to Waverley himself. This effected, he claimed and
received his reward. Waverleyâ€™s illness was an event which deranged all
their calculations. Donald was obliged to leave the neighbourhood with
his people, and to seek more free course for his adventures elsewhere. At
Roseâ€™s entreaty, he left an old man, a herbalist, who was supposed to
understand a little of medicine, to attend Waverley during his illness.

In the meanwhile, new and fearful doubts started in Roseâ€™s mind. They
were suggested by old Janet, who insisted that, a reward having been
offered for the apprehension of Waverley, and his own personal effects
being so valuable, there was no saying to what breach of faith Donald
might be tempted. In an agony of grief and terror, Rose took the daring
resolution of explaining to the Prince himself the danger in which Mr.
Waverley stood, judging that, both as a politician and a man of honour
and humanity, Charles Edward would interest himself to prevent his
falling into the hands of the opposite party. This letter she at first
thought of sending anonymously, but naturally feared it would not in that
case be credited. She therefore subscribed her name, though with
reluctance and terror, and consigned it in charge to a young man, who at
leaving his farm to join the Chevalierâ€™s army, made it his petition to
her to have some sort of credentials to the adventurer, from whom he
hoped to obtain a commission.

The letter reached Charles Edward on his descent to the Lowlands, and,
aware of the political importance of having it supposed that he was in
correspondence with the English Jacobites, he caused the most positive
orders to be transmitted to Donald Bean Lean to transmit Waverley, safe
and uninjured, in person or effects, to the governor of Doune Castle. The
freebooter durst not disobey, for the army of the Prince was now so near
him that punishment might have followed; besides, he was a politician as
well as a robber, and was unwilling to cancel the interest created
through former secret services by being refractory on this occasion. He
therefore made a virtue of necessity, and transmitted orders to his
lieutenant to convey Edward to Doune, which was safely accomplished in
the mode mentioned in a former chapter. The governor of Doune was
directed to send him to Edinburgh as a prisoner, because the Prince was
apprehensive that Waverley, if set at liberty, might have resumed his
purpose of returning to England, without affording him an opportunity of
a personal interview. In this, indeed, he acted by the advice of the
Chieftain of Glennaquoich, with whom it may be remembered the Chevalier
communicated upon the mode of disposing of Edward, though without telling
him how he came to learn the place of his confinement.

This, indeed, Charles Edward considered as a ladyâ€™s secret; for although
Roseâ€™s letter was couched in the most cautious and general terms, and
professed to be written merely from motives of humanity and zeal for the
Princeâ€™s service, yet she expressed so anxious a wish that she should not
be known to have interfered, that the Chevalier was induced to suspect
the deep interest which she took in Waverleyâ€™s safety. This conjecture,
which was well founded, led, however, to false inferences. For the
emotion which Edward displayed on approaching Flora and Rose at the ball
of Holyrood was placed by the Chevalier to the account of the latter; and
he concluded that the Baronâ€™s views about the settlement of his property,
or some such obstacle, thwarted their mutual inclinations. Common fame,
it is true, frequently gave Waverley to Miss Mac-Ivor; but the Prince
knew that common fame is very prodigal in such gifts; and, watching
attentively the behaviour of the ladies towards Waverley, he had no doubt
that the young Englishman had no interest with Flora, and was beloved by
Rose Bradwardine. Desirous to bind Waverley to his service, and wishing
also to do a kind and friendly action, the Prince next assailed the Baron
on the subject of settling his estate upon his daughter. Mr. Bradwardine
acquiesced; but the consequence was that Fergus was immediately induced
to prefer his double suit for a wife and an earldom, which the Prince
rejected in the manner we have seen. The Chevalier, constantly engaged in
his own multiplied affairs, had not hitherto sought any explanation with
Waverley, though often meaning to do so. But after Fergusâ€™s declaration
he saw the necessity of appearing neutral between the rivals, devoutly
hoping that the matter, which now seemed fraught with the seeds of
strife, might be permitted to lie over till the termination of the
expedition. When, on the march to Derby, Fergus, being questioned
concerning his quarrel with Waverley, alleged as the cause that Edward
was desirous of retracting the suit he had made to his sister, the
Chevalier plainly told him that he had himself observed Miss Mac-Ivorâ€™s
behaviour to Waverley, and that he was convinced Fergus was under the
influence of a mistake in judging of Waverleyâ€™s conduct, who, he had
every reason to believe, was engaged to Miss Bradwardine. The quarrel
which ensued between Edward and the Chieftain is, I hope, still in the
remembrance of the reader. These circumstances will serve to explain such
points of our narrative as, according to the custom of story-tellers, we
deemed it fit to leave unexplained, for the purpose of exciting the
readerâ€™s curiosity.

When Janet had once finished the leading facts of this narrative,
Waverley was easily enabled to apply the clue which they afforded to
other mazes of the labyrinth in which he had been engaged. To Rose
Bradwardine, then, he owed the life which he now thought he could
willingly have laid down to serve her. A little reflection convinced him,
however, that to live for her sake was more convenient and agreeable, and
that, being possessed of independence, she might share it with him either
in foreign countries or in his own. The pleasure of being allied to a man
of the Baronâ€™s high worth, and who was so much valued by his uncle Sir
Everard, was also an agreeable consideration, had anything been wanting
to recommend the match. His absurdities, which had appeared grotesquely
ludicrous during his prosperity, seemed, in the sunset of his fortune, to
be harmonised and assimilated with the noble features of his character,
so as to add peculiarity without exciting ridicule. His mind occupied
with such projects of future happiness, Edward sought Little Veolan, the
habitation of Mr. Duncan Macwheeble.




CHAPTER XXXVII

Now is Cupid a child of conscience--he makes restitution.--SHAKSPEARE


Mr. Duncan MacWheeble, no longer Commissary or Bailie, though still
enjoying the empty name of the latter dignity, had escaped proscription
by an early secession from the insurgent party and by his insignificance.

Edward found him in his office, immersed among papers and accounts.
Before him was a large bicker of oatmeal porridge, and at the side
thereof a horn spoon and a bottle of two-penny. Eagerly running his eye
over a voluminous law-paper, he from time to time shovelled an immense
spoonful of these nutritive viands into his capacious mouth. A
pot-bellied Dutch bottle of brandy which stood by intimated either that
this honest limb of the law had taken his morning already, or that he
meant to season his porridge with such digestive; or perhaps both
circumstances might reasonably be inferred. His night-cap and
morning-gown, had whilome been of tartan, but, equally cautious and
frugal, the honest Bailie had got them dyed black, lest their original
ill-omened colour might remind his visitors of his unlucky excursion to
Derby. To sum up the picture, his face was daubed with snuff up to the
eyes, and his fingers with ink up to the knuckles. He looked dubiously at
Waverley as he approached the little green rail which fenced his desk and
stool from the approach of the vulgar. Nothing could give the Bailie more
annoyance than the idea of his acquaintance being claimed by any of the
unfortunate gentlemen who were now so much more likely to need assistance
than to afford profit. But this was the rich young Englishman; who knew
what might be his situation? He was the Baronâ€™s friend too; what was to
be done?





While these reflections gave an air of absurd perplexity to the poor
manâ€™s visage, Waverley, reflecting on the communication he was about to
make to him, of a nature so ridiculously contrasted with the appearance
of the individual, could not help bursting out a-laughing, as he checked
the propensity to exclaim with Syphax--

    Catoâ€™s a proper person to intrust
    A love-tale with.

As Mr. Macwheeble had no idea of any person laughing heartily who was
either encircled by peril or oppressed by poverty, the hilarity of
Edwardâ€™s countenance greatly relieved the embarrassment of his own, and,
giving him a tolerably hearty welcome to Little Veolan, he asked what he
would choose for breakfast. His visitor had, in the first place,
something for his private ear, and begged leave to bolt the door. Duncan
by no means liked this precaution, which savoured of danger to be
apprehended; but he could not now draw back.

Convinced he might trust this man, as he could make it his interest to be
faithful, Edward communicated his present situation and future schemes to
Macwheeble. The wily agent listened with apprehension when he found
Waverley was still in a state of proscription; was somewhat comforted by
learning that he had a passport; rubbed his hands with glee when he
mentioned the amount of his present fortune; opened huge eyes when he
heard the brilliancy of his future expectations; but when he expressed
his intention to share them with Miss Rose Bradwardine, ecstasy had
almost deprived the honest man of his senses. The Bailie started from his
three-footed stool like the Pythoness from her tripod; flung his best wig
out of the window, because the block on which it was placed stood in the
way of his career; chucked his cap to the ceiling, caught it as it fell;
whistled â€˜Tullochgorumâ€™; danced a Highland fling with inimitable grace
and agility, and then threw himself exhausted into a chair, exclaiming,
â€˜Lady Wauverley! ten thousand a year the least penny! Lord preserve my
poor understanding!â€™





â€˜Amen with all my heart,â€™ said Waverley; â€˜but now, Mr. Macwheeble, let us
proceed to business.â€™ This word had somewhat a sedative effect, but the
Bailieâ€™s head, as he expressed himself, was still â€˜in the bees.â€™ He
mended his pen, however, marked half a dozen sheets of paper with an
ample marginal fold, whipped down Dallas of St. Martinâ€™s â€˜Stylesâ€™ from a
shelf, where that venerable work roosted with Stairâ€™s â€˜Institutions,â€™
Dirletonâ€™s â€˜Doubts,â€™ Balfourâ€™s â€˜Practiques,â€™ and a parcel of old
account-books, opened the volume at the article Contract of Marriage, and
prepared to make what he called aâ€™smaâ€™ minute to prevent parties frae
resiling.â€™

With some difficulty Waverley made him comprehend that he was going a
little too fast. He explained to him that he should want his assistance,
in the first place, to make his residence safe for the time, by writing
to the officer at Tully-Veolan that Mr. Stanley, an English gentleman
nearly related to Colonel Talbot, was upon a visit of business at Mr.
Macwheebleâ€™s, and, knowing the state of the country, had sent his
passport for Captain Fosterâ€™s inspection. This produced a polite answer
from the officer, with an invitation to Mr. Stanley to dine with him,
which was declined (as may easily be supposed) under pretence of
business.

Waverleyâ€™s next request was, that Mr. Macwheeble would despatch a man and
horse to----, the post-town at which Colonel Talbot was to address him,
with directions to wait there until the post should bring a letter for
Mr. Stanley, and then to forward it to Little Veolan with all speed. In a
moment the Bailie was in search of his apprentice (or servitor, as he was
called Sixty Years Since), Jock Scriever, and in not much greater space
of time Jock was on the back of the white pony. â€˜Tak care ye guide him
weel, sir, for heâ€™s aye been short in the wind since--ahem--Lord be gude
to me! (in a low voice), I was gaun to come out wiâ€™--since I rode whip
and spur to fetch the Chevalier to redd Mr. Wauverley and Vich Ian Vohr;
and an uncanny coup I gat for my pains. Lord forgie your honour! I might
hae broken my neck; but troth it was in a venture, mae ways nor ane; but
this maks amends for aâ€™. Lady Wauverley! ten thousand a year! Lord be
gude unto me!â€™

â€˜But you forget, Mr. Macwheeble, we want the Baronâ€™s consent--the
ladyâ€™s--â€™

â€˜Never fear, Iâ€™se be caution for them; Iâ€™se gie you my personal
warrandice. Ten thousand a year! it dings Balmawhapple out and out--a
yearâ€™s rentâ€™s worth aâ€™ Balmawhapple, fee and life-rent! Lord make us
thankful!â€™

To turn the current of his feelings, Edward inquired if he had heard
anything lately of the Chieftain of Glennaquoich.

â€˜Not one word,â€™ answered Macwheeble, â€˜but that he was still in Carlisle
Castle, and was soon to be panelled for his life. I dinna wish the young
gentleman ill,â€™ he said, â€˜but I hope that they that hae got him will keep
him, and no let him back to this Hieland border to plague us wiâ€™
black-mail and aâ€™ manner oâ€™ violent, wrongous, and masterfuâ€™ oppression
and spoliation, both by himself and others of his causing, sending, and
hounding out; and he couldna tak care oâ€™ the siller when he had gotten it
neither, but flung it aâ€™ into yon idle queanâ€™s lap at Edinburgh; but
light come light gane. For my part, I never wish to see a kilt in the
country again, nor a red-coat, nor a gun, for that matter, unless it were
to shoot a paitrick; theyâ€™re aâ€™ tarrâ€™d wiâ€™ ae stick. And when they have
done ye wrang, even when ye hae gotten decreet of spuilzie, oppression,
and violent profits against them, what better are ye? They hae na a plack
to pay ye; ye need never extract it.â€™

With such discourse, and the intervening topics of business, the time
passed until dinner, Macwheeble meanwhile promising to devise some mode
of introducing Edward at the Duchran, where Rose at present resided,
without risk of danger or suspicion; which seemed no very easy task,
since the laird was a very zealous friend to government. The poultry-yard
had been laid under requisition, and cockyleeky and Scotch collops soon
reeked in the Bailieâ€™s little parlour. The landlordâ€™s cork-screw was just
introduced into the muzzle of a pint bottle of claret (cribbed possibly
from the cellars of Tully-Veolan), when the sight of the grey pony
passing the window at full trot induced the Bailie, but with due
precaution, to place it aside for the moment. Enter Jock Scriever with a
packet for Mr. Stanley; it is Colonel Talbotâ€™s seal, and Edwardâ€™s ringers
tremble as he undoes it. Two official papers, folded, signed, and sealed
in all formality, drop out. They were hastily picked up by the Bailie,
who had a natural respect for everything resembling a deed, and, glancing
slily on their titles, his eyes, or rather spectacles, are greeted with
â€˜Protection by his Royal Highness to the person of Cosmo Comyne
Bradwardine, Esq., of that ilk, commonly called Baron of Bradwardine,
forfeited for his accession to the late rebellion.â€™ The other proves to
be a protection of the same tenor in favour of Edward Waverley, Esq.
Colonel Talbotâ€™s letter was in these words:--

â€˜My DEAR EDWARD,

â€˜I am just arrived here, and yet I have finished my business; it has cost
me some trouble though, as you shall hear. I waited upon his Royal
Highness immediately on my arrival, and found him in no very good humour
for my purpose. Three or four Scotch gentlemen were just leaving his
levee. After he had expressed himself to me very courteously; â€œWould you
think it,â€ he said, â€œTalbot, here have been half a dozen of the most
respectable gentlemen and best friends to government north of the Forth,
Major Melville of Cairnvreckan, Rubrick of Duchran, and others, who have
fairly wrung from me, by their downright importunity, a present
protection and the promise of a future pardon for that stubborn old rebel
whom they call Baron of Bradwardine. They allege that his high personal
character, and the clemency which he showed to such of our people as fell
into the rebelsâ€™ hands, should weigh in his favour, especially as the
loss of his estate is likely to be a severe enough punishment. Rubrick
has undertaken to keep him at his own house till things are settled in
the country; but itâ€™s a little hard to be forced in a manner to pardon
such a mortal enemy to the House of Brunswick.â€ This was no favourable
moment for opening my business; however, I said I was rejoiced to learn
that his Royal Highness was in the course of granting such requests, as
it emboldened me to present one of the like nature in my own name. He was
very angry, but I persisted; I mentioned the uniform support of our three
votes in, the house, touched modestly on services abroad, though valuable
only in his Royal Highnessâ€™s having been pleased kindly to accept them,
and founded pretty strongly on his own expressions of friendship and
good-will. He was embarrassed, but obstinate. I hinted the policy of
detaching, on all future occasions, the heir of such a fortune as your
uncleâ€™s from the machinations of the disaffected. But I made no
impression. I mentioned the obligations which I lay under to Sir Everard
and to you personally, and claimed, as the sole reward of my services,
that he would be pleased to afford me the means of evincing my gratitude.
I perceived that he still meditated a refusal, and, taking my commission
from my pocket, I said (as a last resource) that, as his Royal Highness
did not, under these pressing circumstances, think me worthy of a favour
which he had not scrupled to grant to other gentlemen whose services I
could hardly judge more important than my own, I must beg leave to
deposit, with all humility, my commission in his Royal Highnessâ€™s hands,
and to retire from the service. He was not prepared for this; he told me
to take up my commission, said some handsome things of my services, and
granted my request. You are therefore once more a free man, and I have
promised for you that you will be a good boy in future, and remember what
you owe to the lenity of government. Thus you see my prince can be as
generous as yours. I do not pretend, indeed, that he confers a favour
with all the foreign graces and compliments of your Chevalier errant; but
he has a plain English manner, and the evident reluctance with which he
grants your request indicates the sacrifice which he makes of his own
inclination to your wishes. My friend, the adjutant-general, has procured
me a duplicate of the Baronâ€™s protection (the original being in Major
Melvilleâ€™s possession), which I send to you, as I know that if you can
find him you will have pleasure in being the first to communicate the
joyful intelligence. He will of course repair to the Duchran without loss
of time, there to ride quarantine for a few weeks. As for you, I give you
leave to escort him thither, and to stay a week there, as I understand a
certain fair lady is in that quarter. And I have the pleasure to tell you
that whatever progress you can make in her good graces will be highly
agreeable to Sir Everard and Mrs. Rachel, who will never believe your
views and prospects settled, and the three ermines passant in actual
safety, until you present them with a Mrs. Edward Waverley. Now, certain
love-affairs of my own--a good many years since--interrupted some
measures which were then proposed in favour of the three ermines passant;
so I am bound in honour to make them amends. Therefore make good use of
your time, for, when your week is expired, it will be necessary that you
go to London to plead your pardon in the law courts.

â€˜Ever, dear Waverley, yours most truly, â€˜PHILIP TALBOT.â€™




CHAPTER XXXVIII

     Happyâ€™s the wooing
     Thatâ€™s not long a doing.


When the first rapturous sensation occasioned by these excellent tidings
had somewhat subsided, Edward proposed instantly to go down to the glen
to acquaint the Baron with their import. But the cautious Bailie justly
observed that, if the Baron were to appear instantly in public, the
tenantry and villagers might become riotous in expressing their joy, and
give offence to â€˜the powers that be,â€™ a sort of persons for whom the
Bailie always had unlimited respect. He therefore proposed that Mr.
Waverley should go to Janet Gellatleyâ€™s and bring the Baron up under
cloud of night to Little Veolan, where he might once more enjoy the
luxury of a good bed. In the meanwhile, he said, he himself would go to
Captain Foster and show him the Baronâ€™s protection, and obtain his
countenance for harbouring him that night, and he would have horses ready
on the morrow to set him on his way to the Duchran along with Mr.
Stanley, â€˜whilk denomination, I apprehend, your honour will for the
present retain,â€™ said the Bailie.

â€˜Certainly, Mr. Macwheeble; but will you not go down to the glen yourself
in the evening to meet your patron?â€™

â€˜That I wad wiâ€™ aâ€™ my heart; and mickle obliged to your honour for
putting me in mind oâ€™ my bounden duty. But it will be past sunset afore I
get back frae the Captainâ€™s, and at these unsonsy hours the glen has a
bad name; thereâ€™s something no that canny about auld Janet Gellatley. The
Laird heâ€™ll no believe thae things, but he was aye ower rash and
venturesome, and feared neither man nor deevil, an saeâ€™s seen oâ€™t. But
right sure am I Sir George Mackenyie says, that no divine can doubt there
are witches, since the Bible says thou shalt not suffer them to live; and
that no lawyer in Scotland can doubt it, since it is punishable with
death by our law. So thereâ€™s baith law and gospel for it. An his honour
winna believe the Leviticus, he might aye believe the Statute-book; but
he may tak his ain way oâ€™t; itâ€™s aâ€™ ane to Duncan Macwheeble. However, I
shall send to ask up auld Janet this eâ€™en; itâ€™s best no to lightly them
that have that character; and weâ€™ll want Davie to turn the spit, for Iâ€™ll
gar Eppie put down a fat goose to the fire for your honours to your
supper.â€™

When it was near sunset Waverley hastened to the hut; and he could not
but allow that superstition had chosen no improper locality, or unfit
object, for the foundation of her fantastic terrors. It resembled exactly
the description of Spenser:--

    There, in a gloomy hollow glen, she found
    A little cottage built of sticks and reeds,
    In homely wise, and wallâ€™d with sods around,
    In which a witch did dwell in loathly weeds,
    And wilful want, all careless of her needs,
    So choosing solitary to abide
    Far from all neighbours, that her devilish deeds,
    And hellish arts, from people she might hide,
    And hurt far off, unknown, whomsoever she espied.

He entered the cottage with these verses in his memory. Poor old Janet,
bent double with age and bleared with peat-smoke, was tottering about the
hut with a birch broom, muttering to herself as she endeavoured to make
her hearth and floor a little clean for the reception of her expected
guests. Waverleyâ€™s step made her start, look up, and fall a-trembling, so
much had her nerves been on the rack for her patronâ€™s safety. With
difficulty Waverley made her comprehend that the Baron was now safe from
personal danger; and when her mind had admitted that joyful news, it was
equally hard to make her believe that he was not to enter again upon
possession of his estate. â€˜It behoved to be,â€™ she said, â€˜he wad get it
back again; naebody wad be sae gripple as to tak his gear after they had
giâ€™en him a pardon: and for that Inch-Grabbit, I could whiles wish mysell
a witch for his sake, if I werena feared the Enemy wad tak me at my
word.â€™ Waverley then gave her some money, and promised that her fidelity
should be rewarded. â€˜How can I be rewarded, sir, sae weel as just to see
my auld maister and Miss Rose come back and bruik their ain?â€™

Waverley now took leave of Janet, and soon stood beneath the Baronâ€™s
Patmos. At a low whistle he observed the veteran peeping out to
reconnoitre, like an old badger with his head out of his hole. â€˜Ye hae
come rather early, my good lad,â€™ said he, descending; â€˜I question if the
red-coats hae beat the tattoo yet, and weâ€™re not safe till then.â€™

â€˜Good news cannot be told too soon,â€™ said Waverley; and with infinite joy
communicated to him the happy tidings. The old man stood for a moment in
silent devotion, then exclaimed, â€˜Praise be to God! I shall see my bairn
again.â€™

â€˜And never, I hope, to part with her more,â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜I trust in God not, unless it be to win the means of supporting her; for
my things are but in a bruckle state;--but what signifies warldâ€™s gear?â€™

â€˜And if,â€™ said Waverley modestly, â€˜there were a situation in life which
would put Miss Bradwardine beyond the uncertainty of fortune, and in the
rank to which she was born, would you object to it, my dear Baron,
because it would make one of your friends the happiest man in the world?â€™
The Baron turned and looked at him with great earnestness. â€˜Yes,â€™
continued Edward, â€˜I shall not consider my sentence of banishment as
repealed unless you will give me permission to accompany you to the
Duchran, and--â€™

The Baron seemed collecting all his dignity to make a suitable reply to
what, at another time, he would have treated as the propounding a treaty
of alliance between the houses of Bradwardine and Waverley. But his
efforts were in vain; the father was too mighty for the Baron; the pride
of birth and rank were swept away; in the joyful surprise a slight
convulsion passed rapidly over his features, as he gave way to the
feelings of nature, threw his arms around Waverleyâ€™s neck, and sobbed
out--â€˜My son, my son! if I had been to search the world, I would have
made my choice here.â€™ Edward returned the embrace with great sympathy of
feeling, and for a little while they both kept silence. At length it was
broken by Edward. â€˜But Miss Bradwardine?â€™

â€˜She had never a will but her old fatherâ€™s; besides, you are a likely
youth, of honest principles and high birth; no, she never had any other
will than mine, and in my proudest days I could not have wished a mair
eligible espousal for her than the nephew of my excellent old friend, Sir
Everard. But I hope, young man, ye deal na rashly in this matter? I hope
ye hae secured the approbation of your ain friends and allies,
particularly of your uncle, who is in loco parentis? Ah! we maun tak heed
oâ€™ that.â€™ Edward assured him that Sir Everard would think himself highly
honoured in the flattering reception his proposal had met with, and that
it had his entire approbation; in evidence of which he put Colonel
Talbotâ€™s letter into the Baronâ€™s hand. The Baron read it with great
attention. â€˜Sir Everard,â€™ he said, â€˜always despised wealth in comparison
of honour and birth; and indeed he hath no occasion to court the Diva
Pecunia. Yet I now wish, since this Malcolm turns out such a parricide,
for I can call him no better, as to think of alienating the family
inheritance--I now wish (his eyes fixed on a part of the roof which was
visible above the trees) that I could have left Rose the auld
hurley-house and the riggs belanging to it. And yet,â€™ said he, resuming
more cheerfully, â€˜itâ€™s maybe as weel as it is; for, as Baron of
Bradwardine, I might have thought it my duty to insist upon certain
compliances respecting name and bearings, whilk now, as a landless laird
wiâ€™ a tocherless daughter, no one can blame me for departing from.â€™

â€˜Now, Heaven be praised!â€™ thought Edward, â€˜that Sir Everard does not hear
these scruples! The three ermines passant and rampant bear would
certainly have gone together by the ears.â€™ He then, with all the ardour
of a young lover, assured the Baron that he sought for his happiness only
in Roseâ€™s heart and hand, and thought himself as happy in her fatherâ€™s
simple approbation as if he had settled an earldom upon his daughter.

They now reached Little Veolan. The goose was smoking on the table, and
the Bailie brandished his knife and fork. A joyous greeting took place
between him and his patron. The kitchen, too, had its company. Auld Janet
was established at the ingle-nook; Davie had turned the spit to his
immortal honour; and even Ban and Buscar, in the liberality of
Macwheebleâ€™s joy, had been stuffed to the throat with food, and now lay
snoring on the floor.

The next day conducted the Baron and his young friend to the Duchran,
where the former was expected, in consequence of the success of the
nearly unanimous application of the Scottish friends of government in his
favour. This had been so general and so powerful that it was almost
thought his estate might have been saved, had it not passed into the
rapacious hands of his unworthy kinsman, whose right, arising out of the
Baronâ€™s attainder, could not be affected by a pardon from the crown. The
old gentleman, however, said, with his usual spirit, he was more
gratified by the hold he possessed in the good opinion of his neighbours
than he would have been in being rehabilitated and restored in integrum,
had it been found practicable.â€™

We shall not attempt to describe the meeting of the father and daughter,
loving each other so affectionately, and separated under such perilous
circumstances. Still less shall we attempt to analyse the deep blush of
Rose at receiving the compliments of Waverley, or stop to inquire whether
she had any curiosity respecting the particular cause of his journey to
Scotland at that period. We shall not even trouble the reader with the
humdrum details of a courtship Sixty Years Since. It is enough to say
that, under so strict a martinet as the Baron, all things were conducted
in due form. He took upon himself, the morning after their arrival, the
task of announcing the proposal of Waverley to Rose, which she heard with
a proper degree of maiden timidity. Fame does, however, say that Waverley
had the evening before found five minutes to apprise her of what was
coming, while the rest of the company were looking at three twisted
serpents which formed a jet dâ€™eau in the garden.

My fair readers will judge for themselves; but, for my part, I cannot
conceive how so important an affair could be communicated in so short a
space of time; at least, it certainly took a full hour in the Baronâ€™s
mode of conveying it.

Waverley was now considered as a received lover in all the forms. He was
made, by dint of smirking and nodding on the part of the lady of the
house, to sit next Miss Bradwardine at dinner, to be Miss Bradwardineâ€™s
partner at cards. If he came into the room, she of the four Miss Rubricks
who chanced to be next Rose was sure to recollect that her thimble or her
scissors were at the other end of the room, in order to leave the seat
nearest to Miss Bradwardine vacant for his occupation. And sometimes, if
papa and mamma were not in the way to keep them on their good behaviour,
the misses would titter a little. The old Laird of Duchran would also
have his occasional jest, and the old lady her remark. Even the Baron
could not refrain; but here Rose escaped every embarrassment but that of
conjecture, for his wit was usually couched in a Latin quotation. The
very footmen sometimes grinned too broadly, the maidservants giggled
mayhap too loud, and a provoking air of intelligence seemed to pervade
the whole family. Alice Bean, the pretty maid of the cavern, who, after
her fatherâ€™s misfortune, as she called it, had attended Rose as
fille-de-chambre, smiled and smirked with the best of them. Rose and
Edward, however, endured all these little vexatious circumstances as
other folks have done before and since, and probably contrived to obtain
some indemnification, since they are not supposed, on the whole, to have
been particularly unhappy during Waverleyâ€™s six daysâ€™ stay at the
Duchran.

It was finally arranged that Edward should go to Waverley-Honour to make
the necessary arrangements for his marriage, thence to London to take the
proper measures for pleading his pardon, and return as soon as possible
to claim the hand of his plighted bride. He also intended in his journey
to visit Colonel Talbot; but, above all, it was his most important object
to learn the fate of the unfortunate Chief of Glennaquoich; to visit him
at Carlisle, and to try whether anything could be done for procuring, if
not a pardon, a commutation at least, or alleviation, of the punishment
to which he was almost certain of being condemned; and, in case of the
worst, to offer the miserable Flora an asylum with Rose, or otherwise to
assist her views in any mode which might seem possible. The fate of
Fergus seemed hard to be averted. Edward had already striven to interest
his friend, Colonel Talbot, in his behalf; but had been given distinctly
to understand by his reply that his credit in matters of that nature was
totally exhausted.

The Colonel was still in Edinburgh, and proposed to wait there for some
months upon business confided to him by the Duke of Cumberland. He was to
be joined by Lady Emily, to whom easy travelling and goatâ€™s whey were
recommended, and who was to journey northward under the escort of Francis
Stanley. Edward, therefore, met the Colonel at Edinburgh, who wished him
joy in the kindest manner on his approaching happiness, and cheerfully
undertook many commissions which our hero was necessarily obliged to
delegate to his charge. But on the subject of Fergus he was inexorable.
He satisfied Edward, indeed, that his interference would be unavailing;
but, besides, Colonel Talbot owned that he could not conscientiously use
any influence in favour of that unfortunate gentleman. â€˜Justice,â€™ he
said, â€˜which demanded some penalty of those who had wrapped the whole
nation in fear and in mourning, could not perhaps have selected a fitter
victim. He came to the field with the fullest light upon the nature of
his attempt. He had studied and understood the subject. His fatherâ€™s fate
could not intimidate him; the lenity of the laws which had restored to
him his fatherâ€™s property and rights could not melt him. That he was
brave, generous, and possessed many good qualities only rendered him the
more dangerous; that he was enlightened and accomplished made his crime
the less excusable; that he was an enthusiast in a wrong cause only made
him the more fit to be its martyr. Above all, he had been the means of
bringing many hundreds of men into the field who, without him, would
never have broken the peace of the country.

â€˜I repeat it,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜though Heaven knows with a heart
distressed for him as an individual, that this young gentleman has
studied and fully understood the desperate game which he has played. He
threw for life or death, a coronet or a coffin; and he cannot now be
permitted, with justice to the country, to draw stakes because the dice
have gone against him.â€™

Such was the reasoning of those times, held even by brave and humane men
towards a vanquished enemy. Let us devoutly hope that, in this respect at
least, we shall never see the scenes or hold the sentiments that were
general in Britain Sixty Years Since.




CHAPTER XXXIX

To morrow? O thatâ€™s sudden!--Spare him, spare himâ€™--SHAKSPEARE


Edward, attended by his former servant Alick Polwarth, who had reentered
his service at Edinburgh, reached Carlisle while the commission of Oyer
and Terminer on his unfortunate associates was yet sitting. He had pushed
forward in haste, not, alas! with the most distant hope of saving Fergus,
but to see him for the last time. I ought to have mentioned that he had
furnished funds for the defence of the prisoners in the most liberal
manner, as soon as he heard that the day of trial was fixed. A solicitor
and the first counsel accordingly attended; but it was upon the same
footing on which the first physicians are usually summoned to the bedside
of some dying man of rank--the doctors to take the advantage of some
incalculable chance of an exertion of nature, the lawyers to avail
themselves of the barely possible occurrence of some legal flaw. Edward
pressed into the court, which was extremely crowded; but by his arriving
from the north, and his extreme eagerness and agitation, it was supposed
he was a relation of the prisoners, and people made way for him. It was
the third sitting of the court, and there were two men at the bar. The
verdict of GUILTY was already pronounced. Edward just glanced at the bar
during the momentous pause which ensued. There was no mistaking the
stately form and noble features of Fergus Mac-Ivor, although his dress
was squalid and his countenance tinged with the sickly yellow hue of long
and close imprisonment. By his side was Evan Maccombich. Edward felt sick
and dizzy as he gazed on them; but he was recalled to himself as the
Clerk of Arraigns pronounced the solemn words: â€˜Fergus Mac-Ivor of
Glennaquoich, otherwise called Vich Ian Vohr, and Evan Mac-Ivor, in the
Dhu of Tarrascleugh, otherwise called Evan Dhu, otherwise called Evan
Maccombich, or Evan Dhu MacCombich--you, and each of you, stand attainted
of high treason. What have you to say for yourselves why the Court should
not pronounce judgment against you, that you die according to law?â€™

Fergus, as the presiding Judge was putting on the fatal cap of judgment,
placed his own bonnet upon his head, regarded him with a steadfast and
stern look, and replied in a firm voice, â€˜I cannot let this numerous
audience suppose that to such an appeal I have no answer to make. But
what I have to say you would not bear to hear, for my defence would be
your condemnation. Proceed, then, in the name of God, to do what is
permitted to you. Yesterday and the day before you have condemned loyal
and honourable blood to be poured forth like water. Spare not mine. Were
that of all my ancestors in my veins, I would have perilled it in this
quarrel.â€™ He resumed his seat and refused again to rise.

Evan Maccombich looked at him with great earnestness, and, rising up,
seemed anxious to speak; but the confusion of the court, and the
perplexity arising from thinking in a language different from that in
which he was to express himself, kept him silent. There was a murmur of
compassion among the spectators, from the idea that the poor fellow
intended to plead the influence of his superior as an excuse for his
crime. The Judge commanded silence, and encouraged Evan to proceed. â€˜I
was only ganging to say, my lord,â€™ said Evan, in what he meant to be an
insinuating manner, â€˜that if your excellent honour and the honourable
Court would let Vich Ian Vohr go free just this once, and let him gae
back to France, and no to trouble King Georgeâ€™s government again, that
ony six oâ€™ the very best of his clan will be willing to be justified in
his stead; and if youâ€™ll just let me gae down to Glennaquoich, Iâ€™ll fetch
them up to ye mysell, to head or hang, and you may begin wiâ€™ me the very
first man.â€™

Notwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion, a sort of laugh was heard
in the court at the extraordinary nature of the proposal. The Judge
checked this indecency, and Evan, looking sternly around, when the murmur
abated, â€˜If the Saxon gentlemen are laughing,â€™ he said, â€˜because a poor
man, such as me, thinks my life, or the life of six of my degree, is
worth that of Vich Ian Vohr, itâ€™s like enough they may be very right; but
if they laugh because they think I would not keep my word and come back
to redeem him, I can tell them they ken neither the heart of a Hielandman
nor the honour of a gentleman.â€™

There was no farther inclination to laugh among the audience, and a dead
silence ensued.

The Judge then pronounced upon both prisoners the sentence of the law of
high treason, with all its horrible accompaniments. The execution was
appointed for the ensuing day. â€˜For you, Fergus Mac-Ivor,â€™ continued the
Judge, â€˜I can hold out no hope of mercy. You must prepare against
to-morrow for your last sufferings here, and your great audit hereafter.â€™

â€˜I desire nothing else, my lord,â€™ answered Fergus, in the same manly and
firm tone.

The hard eyes of Evan, which had been perpetually bent on his Chief, were
moistened with a tear. â€˜For you, poor ignorant man,â€™ continued the Judge,
â€˜who, following the ideas in which you have been educated, have this day
given us a striking example how the loyalty due to the king and state
alone is, from your unhappy ideas of clanship, transferred to some
ambitious individual who ends by making you the tool of his crimes--for
you, I say, I feel so much compassion that, if you can make up your mind
to petition for grace, I will endeavour to procure it for you.
Otherwise--â€™

â€˜Grace me no grace,â€™ said Evan; â€˜since you are to shed Vich Ian Vohrâ€™s
blood, the only favour I would accept from you is to bid them loose my
hands and gie me my claymore, and bide you just a minute sitting where
you are!â€™

â€˜Remove the prisoners,â€™ said the Judge; â€˜his blood be upon his own head.â€™

Almost stupefied with his feelings, Edward found that the rush of the
crowd had conveyed him out into the street ere he knew what he was doing.
His immediate wish was to see and speak with Fergus once more. He applied
at the Castle where his unfortunate friend was confined, but was refused
admittance. â€˜The High Sheriff,â€™ a non-commissioned officer said, â€˜had
requested of the governor that none should be admitted to see the
prisoner excepting his confessor and his sister.â€™

â€˜And where was Miss Mac-Ivor?â€™ They gave him the direction. It was the
house of a respectable Catholic family near Carlisle.

Repulsed from the gate of the Castle, and not venturing to make
application to the High Sheriff or Judges in his own unpopular name, he
had recourse to the solicitor who came down in Fergusâ€™s behalf. This
gentleman told him that it was thought the public mind was in danger of
being debauched by the account of the last moments of these persons, as
given by the friends of the Pretender; that there had been a resolution,
therefore, to exclude all such persons as had not the plea of near
kindred for attending upon them. Yet he promised (to oblige the heir of
Waverley-Honour) to get him an order for admittance to the prisoner the
next morning, before his irons were knocked off for execution.

â€˜Is it of Fergus Mac-Ivor they speak thus,â€™ thought Waverley, â€˜or do I
dream? Of Fergus, the bold, the chivalrous, the free-minded, the lofty
chieftain of a tribe devoted to him? Is it he, that I have seen lead the
chase and head the attack, the brave, the active, the young, the noble,
the love of ladies, and the theme of song,--is it he who is ironed like a
malefactor, who is to be dragged on a hurdle to the common gallows, to
die a lingering and cruel death, and to be mangled by the hand of the
most outcast of wretches? Evil indeed was the spectre that boded such a
fate as this to the brave Chief of Glennaquoich!â€™

With a faltering voice he requested the solicitor to find means to warn
Fergus of his intended visit, should he obtain permission to make it. He
then turned away from him, and, returning to the inn, wrote a scarcely
intelligible note to Flora Mac-Ivor, intimating his purpose to wait upon
her that evening. The messenger brought back a letter in Floraâ€™s
beautiful Italian hand, which seemed scarce to tremble even under this
load of misery. â€˜Miss Flora Mac-Ivor,â€™ the letter bore, â€˜could not refuse
to see the dearest friend of her dear brother, even in her present
circumstances of unparalleled distress.â€™

When Edward reached Miss Mac-Ivorâ€™s present place of abode he was
instantly admitted. In a large and gloomy tapestried apartment Flora was
seated by a latticed window, sewing what seemed to be a garment of white
flannel. At a little distance sat an elderly woman, apparently a
foreigner, and of a religious order. She was reading in a book of
Catholic devotion, but when Waverley entered laid it on the table and
left the room. Flora rose to receive him, and stretched out her hand, but
neither ventured to attempt speech. Her fine complexion was totally gone;
her person considerably emaciated; and her face and hands as white as the
purest statuary marble, forming a strong contrast with her sable dress
and jet-black hair. Yet, amid these marks of distress there was nothing
negligent or ill-arranged about her attire; even her hair, though totally
without ornament, was disposed with her usual attention to neatness. The
first words she uttered were, â€˜Have you seen him?â€™

â€˜Alas, no,â€™ answered Waverley, â€˜I have been refused admittance.â€™

â€˜It accords with the rest,â€™ she said; â€˜but we must submit. Shall you
obtain leave, do you suppose?â€™

â€˜For--for--tomorrow,â€™ said Waverley; but muttering the last word so
faintly that it was almost unintelligible.

â€˜Ay, then or never,â€™ said Flora, â€˜untilâ€™--she added, looking upward--â€˜the
time when, I trust, we shall all meet. But I hope you will see him while
earth yet bears him. He always loved you at his heart, though--but it is
vain to talk of the past.â€™

â€˜Vain indeed!â€™ echoed Waverley.

â€˜Or even of the future, my good friend,â€™ said Flora, â€˜so far as earthly
events are concerned; for how often have I pictured to myself the strong
possibility of this horrid issue, and tasked myself to consider how I
could support my part; and yet how far has all my anticipation fallen
short of the unimaginable bitterness of this hour!â€™

â€˜Dear Flora, if your strength of mind--â€™

â€˜Ay, there it is,â€™ she answered, somewhat wildly; â€˜there is, Mr.
Waverley, there is a busy devil at my heart that whispers--but it were
madness to listen to it--that the strength of mind on which Flora prided
herself has murdered her brother!â€™

â€˜Good God! how can you give utterance to a thought so shocking?â€™

â€˜Ay, is it not so? but yet it haunts me like a phantom; I know it is
unsubstantial and vain; but it will be present; will intrude its horrors
on my mind; will whisper that my brother, as volatile as ardent, would
have divided his energies amid a hundred objects. It was I who taught him
to concentrate them and to gage all on this dreadful and desperate cast.
Oh that I could recollect that I had but once said to him, â€œHe that
striketh with the sword shall die by the swordâ€; that I had but once
said, â€œRemain at home; reserve yourself, your vassals, your life, for
enterprises within the reach of man.â€ But O, Mr. Waverley, I spurred his
fiery temper, and half of his ruin at least lies with his sister!â€™

The horrid idea which she had intimated, Edward endeavoured to combat by
every incoherent argument that occurred to him. He recalled to her the
principles on which both thought it their duty to act, and in which they
had been educated.

â€˜Do not think I have forgotten them,â€™ she said, looking up with eager
quickness; â€˜I do not regret his attempt because it was wrong!--O no! on
that point I am armed--but because it was impossible it could end
otherwise than thus.â€™

â€˜Yet it did not always seem so desperate and hazardous as it was; and it
would have been chosen by the bold spirit of Fergus whether you had
approved it or no; your counsels only served to give unity and
consistence to his conduct; to dignify, but not to precipitate, his
resolution.â€™ Flora had soon ceased to listen to Edward, and was again
intent upon her needlework.

â€˜Do you remember,â€™ she said, looking up with a ghastly smile, â€˜you once
found me making Fergusâ€™s bride-favours, and now I am sewing his bridal
garment. Our friends here,â€™ she continued, with suppressed emotion, â€˜are
to give hallowed earth in their chapel to the bloody relics of the last
Vich Ian Vohr. But they will not all rest together; no--his head!--I
shall not have the last miserable consolation of kissing the cold lips of
my dear, dear Fergus!â€™

The unfortunate Flora here, after one or two hysterical sobs, fainted in
her chair. The lady, who had been attending in the ante-room, now entered
hastily, and begged Edward to leave the room, but not the house.

When he was recalled, after the space of nearly half an hour, he found
that, by a strong effort, Miss Mac-Ivor had greatly composed herself. It
was then he ventured to urge Miss Bradwardineâ€™s claim to be considered as
an adopted sister, and empowered to assist her plans for the future.

â€˜I have had a letter from my dear Rose,â€™ she replied, â€˜to the same
purpose. Sorrow is selfish and engrossing, or I would have written to
express that, even in my own despair, I felt a gleam of pleasure at
learning her happy prospects, and at hearing that the good old Baron has
escaped the general wreck. Give this to my dearest Rose; it is her poor
Floraâ€™s only ornament of value, and was the gift of a princess.â€™ She put
into his hands a case containing the chain of diamonds with which she
used to decorate her hair. â€˜To me it is in future useless. The kindness
of my friends has secured me a retreat in the convent of the Scottish
Benedictine nuns in Paris. Tomorrow--if indeed I can survive tomorrow--I
set forward on my journey with this venerable sister. And now, Mr.
Waverley, adieu! May you be as happy with Rose as your amiable
dispositions deserve; and think sometimes on the friends you have lost.
Do not attempt to see me again; it would be mistaken kindness.â€™

She gave him her hand, on which Edward shed a torrent of tears, and with
a faltering step withdrew from the apartment, and returned to the town of
Carlisle. At the inn he found a letter from his law friend intimating
that he would be admitted to Fergus next morning as soon as the Castle
gates were opened, and permitted to remain with him till the arrival of
the Sheriff gave signal for the fatal procession.







CHAPTER XL

A darker departure is near,
The death drum is muffled, and sable the bier--CAMPBELL


After a sleepless night, the first dawn of morning found Waverley on the
esplanade in front of the old Gothic gate of Carlisle Castle. But he
paced it long in every direction before the hour when, according to the
rules of the garrison, the gates were opened and the draw-bridge lowered.
He produced his order to the sergeant of the guard and was admitted.

The place of Fergusâ€™s confinement was a gloomy and vaulted apartment in
the central part of the Castle; a huge old tower, supposed to be of great
antiquity, and surrounded by outworks, seemingly of Henry VIIIâ€™s time, or
somewhat later. The grating of the large old-fashioned bars and bolts,
withdrawn for the purpose of admitting Edward, was answered by the clash
of chains, as the unfortunate Chieftain, strongly and heavily fettered,
shuffled along the stone floor of his prison to fling himself into his
friendâ€™s arms.

â€˜My dear Edward,â€™ he said, in a firm and even cheerful voice, â€˜this is
truly kind. I heard of your approaching happiness with the highest
pleasure. And how does Rose? and how is our old whimsical friend the
Baron? Well, I trust, since I see you at freedom. And how will you settle
precedence between the three ermines passant and the bear and boot-jack?â€™

â€˜How, O how, my dear Fergus, can you talk of such things at such a
moment!â€™

â€˜Why, we have entered Carlisle with happier auspices, to be sure; on the
16th of November last, for example, when we marched in side by side, and
hoisted the white flag on these ancient towers. But I am no boy, to sit
down and weep because the luck has gone against me. I knew the stake
which I risked; we played the game boldly and the forfeit shall be paid
manfully. And now, since my time is short, let me come to the questions
that interest me most--the Prince? has he escaped the bloodhounds?â€™

â€˜He has, and is in safety.â€™

â€˜Praised be God for that! Tell me the particulars of his escape.â€™

Waverley communicated that remarkable history, so far as it had then
transpired, to which Fergus listened with deep interest. He then asked
after several other friends; and made many minute inquiries concerning
the fate of his own clansmen. They had suffered less than other tribes
who had been engaged in the affair; for, having in a great measure
dispersed and returned home after the captivity of their Chieftain,
according to the universal custom of the Highlanders, they were not in
arms when the insurrection was finally suppressed, and consequently were
treated with less rigour. This Fergus heard with great satisfaction.

â€˜You are rich,â€™ he said, â€˜Waverley, and you are generous. When you hear
of these poor Mac-Ivors being distressed about their miserable
possessions by some harsh overseer or agent of government, remember you
have worn their tartan and are an adopted son of their race, The Baron,
who knows our manners and lives near our country, will apprise you of the
time and means to be their protector. Will you promise this to the last
Vich Ian Vohr?â€™

Edward, as may well be believed, pledged his word; which he afterwards so
amply redeemed that his memory still lives in these glens by the name of
the Friend of the Sons of Ivor.

â€˜Would to God,â€™ continued the Chieftain, â€˜I could bequeath to you my
rights to the love and obedience of this primitive and brave race; or at
least, as I have striven to do, persuade poor Evan to accept of his life
upon their terms, and be to you what he has been to me, the kindest, the
bravest, the most devoted--â€™

The tears which his own fate could not draw forth fell fast for that of
his foster-brother.

â€˜But,â€™ said he, drying them, â€˜that cannot be. You cannot be to them Vich
Ian Vohr; and these three magic words,â€™ said he, half smiling, â€˜are the
only Open Sesame to their feelings and sympathies, and poor Evan must
attend his foster-brother in death, as he has done through his whole
life.â€™

â€˜And I am sure,â€™ said Maccombich, raising himself from the floor, on
which, for fear of interrupting their conversation, he had lain so still
that, in the obscurity of the apartment, Edward was not aware of his
presence--â€˜I am sure Evan never desired or deserved a better end than
just to die with his Chieftain.â€™

â€˜And now,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜while we are upon the subject of clanship--what
think you now of the prediction of the Bodach Glas?â€™ Then, before Edward
could answer, â€˜I saw him again last night: he stood in the slip of
moonshine which fell from that high and narrow window towards my bed.
â€œWhy should I fear him?â€ I thought; â€œto-morrow, long ere this time, I
shall be as immaterial as he.â€ â€œFalse spirit,â€ I said, â€œart thou come to
close thy walks on earth and to enjoy thy triumph in the fall of the last
descendant of thine enemy?â€ The spectre seemed to beckon and to smile as
he faded from my sight. What do you think of it? I asked the same
question of the priest, who is a good and sensible man; he admitted that
the church allowed that such apparitions were possible, but urged me not
to permit my mind to dwell upon it, as imagination plays us such strange
tricks. What do you think of it?â€™

â€˜Much as your confessor,â€™ said Waverley, willing to avoid dispute upon
such a point at such a moment. A tap at the door now announced that good
man, and Edward retired while he administered to both prisoners the last
rites of religion, in the mode which the Church of Rome prescribes.

In about an hour he was re-admitted; soon after, a file of soldiers
entered with a blacksmith, who struck the fetters from the legs of the
prisoners.

â€˜You see the compliment they pay to our Highland strength and courage; we
have lain chained here like wild beasts, till our legs are cramped into
palsy, and when they free us they send six soldiers with loaded muskets
to prevent our taking the castle by storm!â€™

Edward afterwards learned that these severe precautions had been taken in
consequence of a desperate attempt of the prisoners to escape, in which
they had very nearly succeeded.

Shortly afterwards the drums of the garrison beat to arms. â€˜This is the
last turn-out,â€™ said Fergus, â€˜that I shall hear and obey. And now, my
dear, dear Edward, ere we part let us speak of Flora--a subject which
awakes the tenderest feeling that yet thrills within me.â€™

â€˜We part not here!â€™ said Waverley.

â€˜O yes, we do; you must come no farther. Not that I fear what is to
follow for myself,â€™ he said proudly. â€˜Nature has her tortures as well as
art, and how happy should we think the man who escapes from the throes of
a mortal and painful disorder in the space of a short half hour? And this
matter, spin it out as they will, cannot last longer. But what a dying
man can suffer firmly may kill a living friend to look upon. This same
law of high treason,â€™ he continued, with astonishing firmness and
composure, â€˜is one of the blessings, Edward, with which your free country
has accommodated poor old Scotland; her own jurisprudence, as I have
heard, was much milder. But I suppose one day or other--when there are no
longer any wild Highlanders to benefit by its tender mercies--they will
blot it from their records as levelling them with a nation of cannibals.
The mummery, too, of exposing the senseless head--they have not the wit
to grace mine with a paper coronet; there would be some satire in that,
Edward. I hope they will set it on the Scotch gate though, that I may
look, even after death, to the blue hills of my own country, which I love
so dearly. The Baron would have added,

    Moritur, et moriens dukes reminiscitur Argos.â€™

A bustle, and the sound of wheels and horsesâ€™ feet, was now heard in the
court-yard of the Castle. â€˜As I have told you why you must not follow me,
and these sounds admonish me that my time flies fast, tell me how you
found poor Flora.â€™

Waverley, with a voice interrupted by suffocating sensations, gave some
account of the state of her mind.

â€˜Poor Flora!â€™ answered the Chief, â€˜she could have borne her own sentence
of death, but not mine. You, Waverley, will soon know the happiness of
mutual affection in the married state--long, long may Rose and you enjoy
it!--but you can never know the purity of feeling which combines two
orphans like Flora and me, left alone as it were in the world, and being
all in all to each other from our very infancy. But her strong sense of
duty and predominant feeling of loyalty will give new nerve to her mind
after the immediate and acute sensation of this parting has passed away.
She will then think of Fergus as of the heroes of our race, upon whose
deeds she loved to dwell.â€™

â€˜Shall she not see you then?â€™ asked Waverley. â€˜She seemed to expect it.â€™

â€˜A necessary deceit will spare her the last dreadful parting. I could not
part with her without tears, and I cannot bear that these men should
think they have power to extort them. She was made to believe she would
see me at a later hour, and this letter, which my confessor will deliver,
will apprise her that all is over.â€™

An officer now appeared and intimated that the High Sheriff and his
attendants waited before the gate of the Castle to claim the bodies of
Fergus Mac-Ivor and Evan Maccombich. â€˜I come,â€™ said Fergus. Accordingly,
supporting Edward by the arm and followed by Evan Dhu and the priest, he
moved down the stairs of the tower, the soldiers bringing up the rear.
The court was occupied by a squadron of dragoons and a battalion of
infantry, drawn up in hollow square. Within their ranks was the sledge or
hurdle on which the prisoners were to be drawn to the place of execution,
about a mile distant from Carlisle. It was painted black, and drawn by a
white horse. At one end of the vehicle sat the executioner, a
horrid-looking fellow, as beseemed his trade, with the broad axe in his
hand; at the other end, next the horse, was an empty seat for two
persons. Through the deep and dark Gothic archway that opened on the
drawbridge were seen on horseback the High Sheriff and his attendants,
whom the etiquette betwixt the civil and military powers did not permit
to come farther. â€˜This is well GOT UP for a closing scene,â€™ said Fergus,
smiling disdainfully as he gazed around upon the apparatus of terror.
Evan Dhu exclaimed with some eagerness, after looking at the dragoons,â€™
These are the very chields that galloped off at Gladsmuir, before we
could kill a dozen oâ€™ them. They look bold enough now, however.â€™ The
priest entreated him to be silent.

The sledge now approached, and Fergus, turning round, embraced Waverley,
kissed him on each side of the face, and stepped nimbly into his place.
Evan sat down by his side. The priest was to follow in a carriage
belonging to his patron, the Catholic gentleman at whose house Flora
resided. As Fergus waved his hand to Edward the ranks closed around the
sledge, and the whole procession began to move forward. There was a
momentary stop at the gateway, while the governor of the Castle and the
High Sheriff went through a short ceremony, the military officer there
delivering over the persons of the criminals to the civil power. â€˜God
save King George!â€™ said the High Sheriff. When the formality concluded,
Fergus stood erect in the sledge, and, with a firm and steady voice,
replied,â€™ God save King JAMES!â€™ These were the last words which Waverley
heard him speak.

The procession resumed its march, and the sledge vanished from beneath
the portal, under which it had stopped for an instant. The dead march was
then heard, and its melancholy sounds were mingled with those of a
muffled peal tolled from the neighbouring cathedral. The sound of
military music died away as the procession moved on; the sullen clang of
the bells was soon heard to sound alone.

The last of the soldiers had now disappeared from under the vaulted
archway through which they had been filing for several minutes; the
court-yard was now totally empty, but Waverley still stood there as if
stupefied, his eyes fixed upon the dark pass where he had so lately seen
the last glimpse of his friend. At length a female servant of the
governorâ€™s, struck with compassion, at the stupefied misery which his
countenance expressed, asked him if he would not walk into her masterâ€™s
house and sit down? She was obliged to repeat her question twice ere he
comprehended her, but at length it recalled him to himself. Declining the
courtesy by a hasty gesture, he pulled his hat over his eyes, and,
leaving the Castle, walked as swiftly as he could through the empty
streets till he regained his inn, then rushed into an apartment and
bolted the door.

In about an hour and a half, which seemed an age of unutterable suspense,
the sound of the drums and fifes performing a lively air, and the
confused murmur of the crowd which now filled the streets, so lately
deserted, apprised him that all was finished, and that the military and
populace were returning from the dreadful scene. I will not attempt to
describe his sensations.

In the evening the priest made him a visit, and informed him that he did
so by directions of his deceased friend, to assure him that Fergus
Mac-Ivor had died as he lived, and remembered his friendship to the last.
He added, he had also seen Flora, whose state of mind seemed more
composed since all was over. With her and sister Theresa the priest
proposed next day to leave Carlisle for the nearest seaport from which
they could embark for France. Waverley forced on this good man a ring of
some value and a sum of money to be employed (as he thought might gratify
Flora) in the services of the Catholic church for the memory of his
friend. â€˜Fun-garque inani munere,â€™ he repeated, as the ecclesiastic
retired. â€˜Yet why not class these acts of remembrance with other honours,
with which affection in all sects pursues the memory of the dead?â€™

The next morning ere daylight he took leave of the town of Carlisle,
promising to himself never again to enter its walls. He dared hardly look
back towards the Gothic battlements of the fortified gate under which he
passed, for the place is surrounded with an old wall. â€˜Theyâ€™re no there,â€™
said Alick Polwarth, who guessed the cause of the dubious look which
Waverley cast backward, and who, with the vulgar appetite for the
horrible, was master of each detail of the butchery--â€˜the heads are ower
the Scotch yate, as they caâ€™ it. Itâ€™s a great pity of Evan Dhu, who was a
very weel-meaning, good-natured man, to be a Hielandman; and indeed so
was the Laird oâ€™ Glennaquoich too, for that matter, when he wasna in ane
oâ€™ his tirrivies.â€™




CHAPTER XLI

DULCE DOMUM


The impression of horror with which Waverley left Carlisle softened by
degrees into melancholy, a gradation which was accelerated by the painful
yet soothing task of writing to Rose; and, while he could not suppress
his own feelings of the calamity, he endeavoured to place it in a light
which might grieve her without shocking her imagination. The picture
which he drew for her benefit he gradually familiarised to his own mind,
and his next letters were more cheerful, and referred to the prospects of
peace and happiness which lay before them. Yet, though his first horrible
sensations had sunk into melancholy, Edward had reached his native
country before he could, as usual on former occasions, look round for
enjoyment upon the face of nature.

He then, for the first time since leaving Edinburgh, began to experience
that pleasure which almost all feel who return to a verdant, populous,
and highly cultivated country from scenes of waste desolation or of
solitary and melancholy grandeur. But how were those feelings enhanced
when he entered on the domain so long possessed by his forefathers;
recognised the old oaks of Waverley-Chace; thought with what delight he
should introduce Rose to all his favourite haunts; beheld at length the
towers of the venerable hall arise above the woods which embowered it,
and finally threw himself into the arms of the venerable relations to
whom he owed so much duty and affection!

The happiness of their meeting was not tarnished by a single word of
reproach. On the contrary, whatever pain Sir Everard and Mrs. Rachel had
felt during Waverleyâ€™s perilous engagement with the young Chevalier, it
assorted too well with the principles in which they had been brought up
to incur reprobation, or even censure. Colonel Talbot also had smoothed
the way with great address for Edwardâ€™s favourable reception by dwelling
upon his gallant behaviour in the military character, particularly his
bravery and generosity at Preston; until, warmed at the idea of their
nephewâ€™s engaging in single combat, making prisoner, and saving from
slaughter so distinguished an officer as the Colonel himself, the
imagination of the Baronet and his sister ranked the exploits of Edward
with those of Wilibert, Hildebrand, and Nigel, the vaunted heroes of
their line.

The appearance of Waverley, embrowned by exercise and dignified by the
habits of military discipline, had acquired an athletic and hardy
character, which not only verified the Colonelâ€™s narration, but surprised
and delighted all the inhabitants of Waverley-Honour. They crowded to
see, to hear him, and to sing his praises. Mr. Pembroke, who secretly
extolled his spirit and courage in embracing the genuine cause of the
Church of England, censured his pupil gently, nevertheless, for being so
careless of his manuscripts, which indeed, he said, had occasioned him
some personal inconvenience, as, upon the Baronetâ€™s being arrested by a
kingâ€™s messenger, he had deemed it prudent to retire to a concealment
called â€˜The Priestâ€™s Hole,â€™ from the use it had been put to in former
days; where, he assured our hero, the butler had thought it safe to
venture with food only once in the day, so that he had been repeatedly
compelled to dine upon victuals either absolutely cold or, what was
worse, only half warm, not to mention that sometimes his bed had not been
arranged for two days together. Waverleyâ€™s mind involuntarily turned to
the Patmos of the Baron of Bradwardine, who was well pleased with Janetâ€™s
fare and a few bunches of straw stowed in a cleft in the front of a
sand-cliff; but he made no remarks upon a contrast which could only
mortify his worthy tutor.

All was now in a bustle to prepare for the nuptials of Edward, an event
to which the good old Baronet and Mrs. Rachel looked forward as if to the
renewal of their own youth. The match, as Colonel Talbot had intimated,
had seemed to them in the highest degree eligible, having every
recommendation but wealth, of which they themselves had more than enough.
Mr. Clippurse was therefore summoned to Waverley-Honour, under better
auspices than at the commencement of our story. But Mr. Clippurse came
not alone; for, being now stricken in years, he had associated with him a
nephew, a younger vulture (as our English Juvenal, who tells the tale of
Swallow the attorney, might have called him), and they now carried on
business as Messrs. Clippurse and Hookem. These worthy gentlemen had
directions to make the necessary settlements on the most splendid scale
of liberality, as if Edward were to wed a peeress in her own right, with
her paternal estate tacked to the fringe of her ermine.

But before entering upon a subject of proverbial delay, I must remind my
reader of the progress of a stone rolled downhill by an idle truant boy
(a pastime at which I was myself expert in my more juvenile years), it
moves at first slowly, avoiding by inflection every obstacle of the least
importance; but when it has attained its full impulse, and draws near the
conclusion of its career, it smokes and thunders down, taking a rood at
every spring, clearing hedge and ditch like a Yorkshire huntsman, and
becoming most furiously rapid in its course when it is nearest to being
consigned to rest for ever. Even such is the course of a narrative like
that which you are perusing. The earlier events are studiously dwelt
upon, that you, kind reader, may be introduced to the character rather by
narrative than by the duller medium of direct description; but when the
story draws near its close, we hurry over the circumstances, however
important, which your imagination must have forestalled, and leave you to
suppose those things which it would be abusing your patience to relate at
length.

We are, therefore, so far from attempting to trace the dull progress of
Messrs. Clippurse and Hookem, or that of their worthy official brethren
who had the charge of suing out the pardons of Edward Waverley and his
intended father-in-law, that we can but touch upon matters more
attractive. The mutual epistles, for example, which were exchanged
between Sir Everard and the Baron upon this occasion, though matchless
specimens of eloquence in their way, must be consigned to merciless
oblivion. Nor can I tell you at length how worthy Aunt Rachel, not
without a delicate and affectionate allusion to the circumstances which
had transferred Roseâ€™s maternal diamonds to the hands of Donald Bean
Lean, stocked her casket with a set of jewels that a duchess might have
envied. Moreover, the reader will have the goodness to imagine that Job
Houghton and his dame were suitably provided for, although they could
never be persuaded that their son fell otherwise than fighting by the
young squireâ€™s side; so that Alick, who, as a lover of truth, had made
many needless attempts to expound the real circumstances to them, was
finally ordered to say not a word more upon the subject. He indemnified
himself, however, by the liberal allowance of desperate battles, grisly
executions, and raw-head and bloody-bone stories with which he astonished
the servantsâ€™ hall.

But although these important matters may be briefly told in narrative,
like a newspaper report of a Chancery suit, yet, with all the urgency
which Waverley could use, the real time which the law proceedings
occupied, joined to the delay occasioned by the mode of travelling at
that period, rendered it considerably more than two months ere Waverley,
having left England, alighted once more at the mansion of the Laird of
Duchran to claim the hand of his plighted bride.

The day of his marriage was fixed for the sixth after his arrival. The
Baron of Bradwardine, with whom bridals, christenings, and funerals were
festivals of high and solemn import, felt a little hurt that, including
the family of the Duchran and all the immediate vicinity who had title to
be present on such an occasion, there could not be above thirty persons
collected. â€˜When he was married,â€™ he observed, â€˜three hundred horse of
gentlemen born, besides servants, and some score or two of Highland
lairds, who never got on horseback, were present on the occasion.â€™

But his pride found some consolation in reflecting that, he and his
son-in-law having been so lately in arms against government, it might
give matter of reasonable fear and offence to the ruling powers if they
were to collect together the kith, kin, and allies of their houses,
arrayed in effeir of war, as was the ancient custom of Scotland on these
occasions--â€˜And, without dubitation,â€™ he concluded with a sigh, â€˜many of
those who would have rejoiced most freely upon these joyful espousals are
either gone to a better place or are now exiles from their native land.â€™

The marriage took place on the appointed day. The Reverend Mr. Rubrick,
kinsman to the proprietor of the hospitable mansion where it was
solemnised, and chaplain to the Baron of Bradwardine, had the
satisfaction to unite their hands; and Frank Stanley acted as bridesman,
having joined Edward with that view soon after his arrival. Lady Emily
and Colonel Talbot had proposed being present; but Lady Emilyâ€™s health,
when the day approached, was found inadequate to the journey. In amends
it was arranged that Edward Waverley and his lady, who, with the Baron,
proposed an immediate journey to Waverley-Honour, should in their way
spend a few days at an estate which Colonel Talbot had been tempted to
purchase in Scotland as a very great bargain, and at which he proposed to
reside for some time.




CHAPTER XLII

This is no mine ain house, I ken by the bigging oâ€™t--Old Song.


The nuptial party travelled in great style. There was a coach and six
after the newest pattern, which Sir Everard had presented to his nephew,
that dazzled with its splendour the eyes of one half of Scotland; there
was the family coach of Mr. Rubrick;--both these were crowded with
ladies,--and there were gentlemen on horseback, with their servants, to
the number of a round score. Nevertheless, without having the fear of
famine before his eyes, Bailie Macwheeble met them in the road to entreat
that they would pass by his house at Little Veolan. The Baron stared, and
said his son and he would certainly ride by Little Veolan and pay their
compliments to the Bailie, but could not think of bringing with them the
â€˜haill comitatus nuptialis, or matrimonial procession.â€™ He added, â€˜that,
as he understood that the barony had been sold by its unworthy possessor,
he was glad to see his old friend Duncan had regained his situation under
the new Dominus, or proprietor.â€™ The Bailie ducked, bowed, and fidgeted,
and then again insisted upon his invitation; until the Baron, though
rather piqued at the pertinacity of his instances, could not nevertheless
refuse to consent without making evident sensations which he was anxious
to conceal.

He fell into a deep study as they approached the top of the avenue, and
was only startled from it by observing that the battlements were
replaced, the ruins cleared away, and (most wonderful of all) that the
two great stone bears, those mutilated Dagons of his idolatry, had
resumed their posts over the gateway. â€˜Now this new proprietor,â€™ said he
to Edward, â€˜has shown mair gusto, as the Italians call it, in the short
time he has had this domain, than that hound Malcolm, though I bred him
here mysell, has acquired vita adhuc durante. And now I talk of hounds,
is not yon Ban and Buscar who come scouping up the avenue with Davie
Gellatley?â€™

â€˜I vote we should go to meet them, sir,â€™ said Waverley, â€˜for I believe
the present master of the house is Colonel Talbot, who will expect to see
us. We hesitated to mention to you at first that he had purchased your
ancient patrimonial property, and even yet, if you do not incline to
visit him, we can pass on to the Bailieâ€™s.â€™

The Baron had occasion for all his magnanimity. However, he drew a long
breath, took a long snuff, and observed, since they had brought him so
far, he could not pass the Colonelâ€™s gate, and he would be happy to see
the new master of his old tenants. He alighted accordingly, as did the
other gentlemen and ladies; he gave his arm to his daughter, and as they
descended the avenue pointed out to her how speedily the â€˜Diva Pecunia of
the Southron--their tutelary deity, he might call her--had removed the
marks of spoliation.â€™

In truth, not only had the felled trees been removed, but, their stumps
being grubbed up and the earth round them levelled and sown with grass,
every mark of devastation, unless to an eye intimately acquainted with
the spot, was already totally obliterated. There was a similar
reformation in the outward man of Davie Gellatley, who met them, every
now and then stopping to admire the new suit which graced his person, in
the same colours as formerly, but bedizened fine enough to have served
Touchstone himself. He danced up with his usual ungainly frolics, first
to the Baron and then to Rose, passing his hands over his clothes,
crying, â€˜Braâ€™, braâ€™ Davie,â€™ and scarce able to sing a bar to an end of
his thousand-and-one songs for the breathless extravagance of his joy.
The dogs also acknowledged their old master with a thousand gambols.
â€˜Upon my conscience, Rose,â€™ ejaculated the Baron, â€˜the gratitude oâ€™ thae
dumb brutes and of that puir innocent brings the tears into my auld een,
while that schellum Malcolm--but Iâ€™m obliged to Colonel Talbot for
putting my hounds into such good condition, and likewise for puir Davie.
But, Rose, my dear, we must not permit them to be a life-rent burden upon
the estate.â€™

As he spoke, Lady Emily, leaning upon the arm of her husband, met the
party at the lower gate with a thousand welcomes. After the ceremony of
introduction had been gone through, much abridged by the ease and
excellent breeding of Lady Emily, she apologised for having used a little
art to wile them back to a place which might awaken some painful
reflections--â€˜But as it was to change masters, we were very desirous that
the Baron--â€™

â€˜Mr. Bradwardine, madam, if you please,â€™ said the old gentleman.

â€˜--Mr. Bradwardine, then, and Mr. Waverley should see what we have done
towards restoring the mansion of your fathers to its former state.â€™

The Baron answered with a low bow. Indeed, when he entered the court,
excepting that the heavy stables, which had been burnt down, were
replaced by buildings of a lighter and more picturesque appearance, all
seemed as much as possible restored to the state in which he had left it
when he assumed arms some months before. The pigeon-house was
replenished; the fountain played with its usual activity, and not only
the bear who predominated over its basin, but all the other bears
whatsoever, were replaced on their several stations, and renewed or
repaired with so much care that they bore no tokens of the violence which
had so lately descended upon them. While these minutiae had been so
needfully attended to, it is scarce necessary to add that the house
itself had been thoroughly repaired, as well as the gardens, with the
strictest attention to maintain the original character of both, and to
remove as far as possible all appearance of the ravage they had
sustained. The Baron gazed in silent wonder; at length he addressed
Colonel Talbot--

â€˜While I acknowledge my obligation to you, sir, for the restoration of
the badge of our family, I cannot but marvel that you have nowhere
established your own crest, whilk is, I believe, a mastiff, anciently
called a talbot; as the poet has it,

    A talbot strong, a sturdy tyke.

At least such a dog is the crest of the martial and renowned Earls of
Shrewsbury, to whom your family are probably blood-relations.â€™

â€˜I believe,â€™ said the Colonel, smiling, â€˜our dogs are whelps of the same
litter; for my part, if crests were to dispute precedence, I should be
apt to let them, as the proverb says, â€œfight dog, fight bear.â€â€™

As he made this speech, at which the Baron took another long pinch of
snuff, they had entered the house, that is, the Baron, Rose, and Lady
Emily, with young Stanley and the Bailie, for Edward and the rest of the
party remained on the terrace to examine a new greenhouse stocked with
the finest plants. The Baron resumed his favourite topic--â€˜However it may
please you to derogate from the honour of your burgonet, Colonel Talbot,
which is doubtless your humour, as I have seen in other gentlemen of
birth and honour in your country, I must again repeat it as a most
ancient and distinguished bearing, as well as that of my young friend
Francis Stanley, which is the eagle and child.â€™

â€˜The bird and bantling they call it in Derbyshire, sir,â€™ said Stanley.

â€˜Yeâ€™re a daft callant, sir,â€™ said the Baron, who had a great liking to
this young man, perhaps because he sometimes teased him--â€˜Yeâ€™re a daft
callant, and I must correct you some of these days,â€™ shaking his great
brown fist at him. â€˜But what I meant to say, Colonel Talbot, is, that
yours is an ancient prosapia, or descent, and since you have lawfully and
justly acquired the estate for you and yours which I have lost for me and
mine, I wish it may remain in your name as many centuries as it has done
in that of the late proprietorâ€™s.â€™

â€˜That,â€™ answered the Colonel, â€˜is very handsome, Mr. Bradwardine,
indeed.â€™

â€˜And yet, sir, I cannot but marvel that you, Colonel, whom I noted to
have so much of the amor patritz when we met in Edinburgh as even to
vilipend other countries, should have chosen to establish your Lares, or
household gods, procul a patrice finibus, and in a manner to expatriate
yourself.â€™

â€˜Why really, Baron, I do not see why, to keep the secret of these foolish
boys, Waverley and Stanley, and of my wife, who is no wiser, one old
soldier should continue to impose upon another. You must know, then, that
I have so much of that same prejudice in favour of my native country,
that the sum of money which I advanced to the seller of this extensive
barony has only purchased for me a box in----shire, called Brere-wood
Lodge, with about two hundred and fifty acres of land, the chief merit of
which is, that it is within a very few miles of Waverley-Honour.â€™

â€˜And who, then, in the name of Heaven, has bought this property?â€™

â€˜That,â€™ said the Colonel, â€˜it is this gentlemanâ€™s profession to explain.â€™

The Bailie, whom this reference regarded, and who had all this while
shifted from one foot to another with great impatience, â€˜like a hen,â€™ as
he afterwards said, â€˜upon a het girdleâ€™; and chuckling, he might have
added, like the said hen in all the glory of laying an egg, now pushed
forward. â€˜That I can, that I can, your honour,â€™ drawing from his pocket a
budget of papers, and untying the red tape with a hand trembling with
eagerness. â€˜Here is the disposition and assignation by Malcolm
Bradwardine of Inch-Grabbit, regularly signed and tested in terms of the
statute, whereby, for a certain sum of sterling money presently contented
and paid to him, he has disponed, alienated, and conveyed the whole
estate and barony of Bradwardine, Tully-Veolan, and others, with the
fortalice and manor-place--â€™

â€˜For Godâ€™s sake, to the point, sir; I have all that by heart,â€™ said the
Colonel.

â€˜--To Cosmo Comyne Bradwardme, Esq.,â€™ pursued the Bailie, â€˜his heirs and
assignees, simply and irredeemably, to be held either a me vel de me--â€™

â€˜Pray read short, sir.â€™

â€˜On the conscience of an honest man, Colonel, I read as short as is
consistent with style--under the burden and reservation always--â€™

â€˜Mr. Macwheeble, this would outlast a Russian winter; give me leave. In
short, Mr. Bradwardine, your family estate is your own once more in full
property, and at your absolute disposal, but only burdened with the sum
advanced to re-purchase it, which I understand is utterly disproportioned
to its value.â€™

â€˜An auld sang--an auld sang, if it please your honours,â€™ cried the
Bailie, rubbing his hands; â€˜look at the rental book.â€™

â€˜--Which sum being advanced, by Mr. Edward Waverley, chiefly from the
price of his fatherâ€™s property which I bought from him, is secured to his
lady your daughter and her family by this marriage.â€™

â€˜It is a catholic security,â€™ shouted the Bailie,â€™ to Rose Comyne
Bradwardine, alias Wauverley, in life-rent, and the children of the said
marriage in fee; and I made up a wee bit minute of an antenuptial
contract, intuitu matrimonij, so it cannot be subject to reduction
hereafter, as a donation inter virum et uxorem.â€™

It is difficult to say whether the worthy Baron was most delighted with
the restitution of his family property or with the delicacy and
generosity that left him unfettered to pursue his purpose in disposing of
it after his death, and which avoided as much as possible even the
appearance of laying him under pecuniary obligation. When his first pause
of joy and astonishment was over, his thoughts turned to the unworthy
heir-male, who, he pronounced, had sold his birthright, like Esau, for a
mess oâ€™ pottage.

â€˜But wha cookit the parritch for him?â€™ exclaimed the Bailie; â€˜I wad like
to ken that;--wha but your honourâ€™s to command, Duncan Macwheeble? His
honour, young Mr. Wauverley, put it aâ€™ into my hand frae the
beginning--frae the first calling oâ€™ the summons, as I may say. I
circumvented them--I played at bogle about the bush wiâ€™ them--I cajolled
them; and if I havena gien Inch-Grabbit and Jamie Howie a bonnie begunk,
they ken themselves. Him a writer! I didna gae slapdash to them wiâ€™ our
young braâ€™ bridegroom, to gar them baud up the market. Na, na; I scared
them wiâ€™ our wild tenantry, and the Mac-Ivors, that are but ill settled
yet, till they durstna on ony errand whatsoever gang ower the doorstane
after gloaming, for fear John Heatherblutter, or some siccan
dare-the-deil, should tak a baff at them; then, on the other hand, I
beflummed them wiâ€™ Colonel Talbot; wad they offer to keep up the price
againâ€™ the Dukeâ€™s friend? did they na ken wha was master? had they na
seen eneugh, by the sad example of mony a puir misguided unhappy body--â€™

â€˜Who went to Derby, for example, Mr. Macwheeble?â€™ said the Colonel to him
aside.

â€˜O whisht, Colonel, for the love oâ€™ God! let that flee stick iâ€™ the waâ€™.
There were mony good folk at Derby; and itâ€™s ill speaking of
haltersâ€™--with a sly cast of his eye toward the Baron, who was in a deep
reverie.

Starting out of it at once, he took Macwheeble by the button and led him
into one of the deep window recesses, whence only fragments of their
conversation reached the rest of the party. It certainly related to
stamp-paper and parchment; for no other subject, even from the mouth of
his patron, and he once more an efficient one, could have arrested so
deeply the Bailieâ€™s reverent and absorbed attention.

â€˜I understand your honour perfectly; it can be dune as easy as taking out
a decreet in absence.â€™

â€˜To her and him, after my demise, and to their heirs-male, but preferring
the second son, if God shall bless them with two, who is to carry the
name and arms of Bradwardine of that ilk, without any other name or
armorial bearings whatsoever.â€™

â€˜Tut, your honour!â€™ whispered the Bailie, â€˜Iâ€™ll mak a slight jotting the
morn; it will cost but a charter of resignation in favorem; and Iâ€™ll hae
it ready for the next term in Exchequer.â€™

Their private conversation ended, the Baron was now summoned to do the
honours of Tully-Veolan to new guests. These were Major Melville of
Cairnvreckan and the Reverend Mr. Morton, followed by two or three others
of the Baronâ€™s acquaintances, who had been made privy to his having again
acquired the estate of his fathers. The shouts of the villagers were also
heard beneath in the courtyard; for Saunders Saunderson, who had kept the
secret for several days with laudable prudence, had unloosed his tongue
upon beholding the arrival of the carriages.

But, while Edward received Major Melville with politeness and the
clergyman with the most affectionate and grateful kindness, his
father-in-law looked a little awkward, as uncertain how he should answer
the necessary claims of hospitality to his guests, and forward the
festivity of his tenants. Lady Emily relieved him by intimating that,
though she must be an indifferent representative of Mrs. Edward Waverley
in many respects, she hoped the Baron would approve of the entertainment
she had ordered in expectation of so many guests; and that they would
find such other accommodations provided as might in some degree support
the ancient hospitality of Tully-Veolan. It is impossible to describe the
pleasure which this assurance gave the Baron, who, with an air of
gallantry half appertaining to the stiff Scottish laird and half to the
officer in the French service, offered his arm to the fair speaker, and
led the way, in something between a stride and a minuet step, into the
large dining parlour, followed by all the rest of the good company.

By dint of Saundersonâ€™s directions and exertions, all here, as well as in
the other apartments, had been disposed as much as possible according to
the old arrangement; and where new movables had been necessary, they had
been selected in the same character with the old furniture. There was one
addition to this fine old apartment, however, which drew tears into the
Baronâ€™s eyes. It was a large and spirited painting, representing Fergus
Mac-Ivor and Waverley in their Highland dress, the scene a wild, rocky,
and mountainous pass, down which the clan were descending in the
background. It was taken from a spirited sketch, drawn while they were in
Edinburgh by a young man of high genius, and had been painted on a
full-length scale by an eminent London artist. Raeburn himself (whose
â€˜Highland Chiefsâ€™ do all but walk out of the canvas) could not have done
more justice to the subject; and the ardent, fiery, and impetuous
character of the unfortunate Chief of Glennaquoich was finely contrasted
with the contemplative, fanciful, and enthusiastic expression of his
happier friend. Beside this painting hung the arms which Waverley had
borne in the unfortunate civil war. The whole piece was beheld with
admiration and deeper feelings.

Men must, however, eat, in spite both of sentiment and vertu; and the
Baron, while he assumed the lower end of the table, insisted that Lady
Emily should do the honours of the head, that they might, he said, set a
meet example to the YOUNG FOLK. After a pause of deliberation, employed
in adjusting in his own brain the precedence between the Presbyterian
kirk and Episcopal church of Scotland, he requested Mr. Morton, as the
stranger, would crave a blessing, observing that Mr. Rubrick, who was at
HOME, would return thanks for the distinguished mercies it had been his
lot to experience. The dinner was excellent. Saunderson attended in full
costume, with all the former domestics, who had been collected, excepting
one or two, that had not been heard of since the affair of Culloden. The
cellars were stocked with wine which was pronounced to be superb, and it
had been contrived that the Bear of the Fountain, in the courtyard,
should (for that night only) play excellent brandy punch for the benefit
of the lower orders.

When the dinner was over the Baron, about to propose a toast, cast a
somewhat sorrowful look upon the sideboard, which, however, exhibited
much of his plate, that had either been secreted or purchased by
neighbouring gentlemen from the soldiery, and by them gladly restored to
the original owner.

â€œIn the late times,â€ he said, â€œthose must be thankful who have saved life
and land; yet when I am about to pronounce this toast, I cannot but
regret an old heirloom, Lady Emily, a POCULUM POTATORIUM, Colonel
Talbot--â€

Here the Baronâ€™s elbow was gently touched by his major-domo, and, turning
round, he beheld in the hands of Alexander ab Alexandro the celebrated
cup of Saint Duthac, the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine! I question if the
recovery of his estate afforded him more rapture. â€œBy my honour,â€ he
said, â€œone might almost believe in brownies and fairies, Lady Emily, when
your ladyship is in presence!â€

â€œI am truly happy,â€ said Colonel Talbot, â€œthat, by the recovery of this
piece of family antiquity, it has fallen within my power to give you some
token of my deep interest in all that concerns my young friend Edward.
But that you may not suspect Lady Emily for a sorceress, or me for a
conjuror, which is no joke in Scotland, I must tell you that Frank
Stanley, your friend, who has been seized with a tartan fever ever since
he heard Edwardâ€™s tales of old Scottish manners, happened to describe to
us at second-hand this remarkable cup. My servant, Spontoon, who, like a
true old soldier, observes everything and says little, gave me afterwards
to understand that he thought he had seen the piece of plate Mr. Stanley
mentioned in the possession of a certain Mrs. Nosebag, who, having been
originally the helpmate of a pawnbroker, had found opportunity during the
late unpleasant scenes in Scotland to trade a little in her old line, and
so became the depositary of the more valuable part of the spoil of half
the army. You may believe the cup was speedily recovered; and it will
give me very great pleasure if you allow me to suppose that its value is
not diminished by having been restored through my means.â€

A tear mingled with the wine which the Baron filled, as he proposed a cup
of gratitude to Colonel Talbot, and â€˜The Prosperity of the united Houses
of Waverley-Honour and Bradwardine!â€™

It only remains for me to say that, as no wish was ever uttered with more
affectionate sincerity, there are few which, allowing for the necessary
mutability of human events, have been upon the whole more happily
fulfilled.




CHAPTER XLIII

A POSTSCRIPT WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PREFACE


Our journey is now finished, gentle reader; and if your patience has
accompanied me through these sheets, the contract is, on your part,
strictly fulfilled. Yet, like the driver who has received his full hire,
I still linger near you, and make, with becoming diffidence, a trifling
additional claim upon your bounty and good nature. You are as free,
however, to shut the volume of the one petitioner as to close your door
in the face of the other.

This should have been a prefatory chapter, but for two reasons: First,
that most novel readers, as my own conscience reminds me, are apt to be
guilty of the sin of omission respecting that same matter of prefaces;
Secondly, that it is a general custom with that class of students to
begin with the last chapter of a work; so that, after all, these remarks,
being introduced last in order, have still the best chance to be read in
their proper place.

There is no European nation which, within the course of half a century or
little more, has undergone so complete a change as this kingdom of
Scotland. The effects of the insurrection of 1745,--the destruction of
the patriarchal power of the Highland chiefs,--the abolition of the
heritable jurisdictions of the Lowland nobility and barons,--the total
eradication of the Jacobite party, which, averse to intermingle with the
English, or adopt their customs, long continued to pride themselves upon
maintaining ancient Scottish manners and customs,--commenced this
innovation. The gradual influx of wealth and extension of commerce have
since united to render the present people of Scotland a class of beings
as different from their grandfathers as the existing English are from
those of Queen Elizabethâ€™s time.

The political and economical effects of these changes have been traced by
Lord Selkirk with great precision and accuracy. But the change, though
steadily and rapidly progressive, has nevertheless been gradual; and,
like those who drift down the stream of a deep and smooth river, we are
not aware of the progress we have made until we fix our eye on the now
distant point from which we have been drifted. Such of the present
generation as can recollect the last twenty or twenty-five years of the
eighteenth century will be fully sensible of the truth of this statement;
especially if their acquaintance and connexions lay among those who in my
younger time were facetiously called â€˜folks of the old leaven,â€™ who still
cherished a lingering, though hopeless, attachment to the house of
Stuart.

This race has now almost entirely vanished from the land, and with it,
doubtless, much absurd political prejudice; but also many living examples
of singular and disinterested attachment to the principles of loyalty
which they received from their fathers, and of old Scottish faith,
hospitality, worth, and honour.

It was my accidental lot, though not born a Highlander (which may be an
apology for much bad Gaelic), to reside during my childhood and youth
among persons of the above description; and now, for the purpose of
preserving some idea of the ancient manners of which I have witnessed the
almost total extinction, I have embodied in imaginary scenes, and
ascribed to fictitious characters, a part of the incidents which I then
received from those who were actors in them. Indeed, the most romantic
parts of this narrative are precisely those which have a foundation in
fact.

The exchange of mutual protection between a Highland gentleman and an
officer of rank in the kingâ€™s service, together with the spirited manner
in which the latter asserted his right to return the favour he had
received, is literally true. The accident by a musket shot, and the
heroic reply imputed to Flora, relate to a lady of rank not long
deceased. And scarce a gentleman who was â€˜in hidingâ€™ after the battle of
Culloden but could tell a tale of strange concealments and of wild and
hairâ€™sbreadthâ€™scapes as extraordinary as any which I have ascribed to my
heroes. Of this, the escape of Charles Edward himself, as the most
prominent, is the most striking example. The accounts of the battle of
Preston and skirmish at Clifton are taken from the narrative of
intelligent eye-witnesses, and corrected from the â€˜History of the
Rebellionâ€™ by the late venerable author of â€˜Douglas.â€™ The Lowland
Scottish gentlemen and the subordinate characters are not given as
individual portraits, but are drawn from the general habits of the
period, of which I have witnessed some remnants in my younger days, and
partly gathered from tradition.

It has been my object to describe these persons, not by a caricatured and
exaggerated use of the national dialect, but by their habits, manners,
and feelings, so as in some distant degree to emulate the admirable Irish
portraits drawn by Miss Edgeworth, so different from the â€˜Teaguesâ€™ and
â€˜dear joysâ€™ who so long, with the most perfect family resemblance to each
other, occupied the drama and the novel.

I feel no confidence, however, in the manner in which I have executed my
purpose. Indeed, so little was I satisfied with my production, that I
laid it aside in an unfinished state, and only found it again by mere
accident among other waste papers in an old cabinet, the drawers of which
I was rummaging in order to accommodate a friend with some
fishing-tackle, after it had been mislaid for several years.

Two works upon similar subjects, by female authors whose genius is highly
creditable to their country, have appeared in the interval; I mean Mrs.
Hamiltonâ€™s â€˜Glenburnieâ€™ and the late account of â€˜Highland Superstitions.â€™
But the first is confined to the rural habits of Scotland, of which it
has given a picture with striking and impressive fidelity; and the
traditional records of the respectable and ingenious Mrs. Grant of Laggan
are of a nature distinct from the fictitious narrative which I have here
attempted.

I would willingly persuade myself that the preceding work will not be
found altogether uninteresting. To elder persons it will recall scenes
and characters familiar to their youth; and to the rising generation the
tale may present some idea of the manners of their forefathers.

Yet I heartily wish that the task of tracing the evanescent manners of
his own country had employed the pen of the only man in Scotland who
could have done it justice--of him so eminently distinguished in elegant
literature, and whose sketches of Colonel Caustic and Umphraville are
perfectly blended with the finer traits of national character. I should
in that case have had more pleasure as a reader than I shall ever feel in
the pride of a successful author, should these sheets confer upon me that
envied distinction. And, as I have inverted the usual arrangement,
placing these remarks at the end of the work to which they refer, I will
venture on a second violation of form, by closing the whole with a
Dedication--
