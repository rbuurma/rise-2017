# Rise of the CS21 DH assignment

## CS21 side of the joint assignment

The goal of the CS21 assignment is to introduce CS21 students to concepts in Rise of the Novel while practicing top-down design. This assignment will require students to create and manipulate a list of lists data. Searching and sorting will not be new concepts, but searching and sorting in this data structure will be new. 

For the programming content of the lab, students will need to create a list of word counts for two different texts. With these two sets of word counts, students will:
* Display the most frequent (n=10) words in each text
* Display the most words that are most prevalent in one text relative to the other text (n=10)
* Display a key word in context/concordance for a single word in one of the texts

Students in CS21 would likely be unable to analyze the results in a meaningful way, but these results will be used in the Rise of the Novel class.

## Rise of the Novel side of the joint assignment

The goal of the Rise of the Novel assignment is to introduce RotN students to concepts in CS21. Students will get to view and run code written by their peers in CS21 to analyze texts they are reading in RotN.
